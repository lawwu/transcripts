[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.800]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.420]   Today's episode is the fifth in a six-episode series
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.160]   on fitness, exercise, and performance.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.600]   And today's episode is all about recovery.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480]   That is, how to maximize your recovery
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.220]   to achieve your fitness and exercise and performance goals,
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400]   and how to avoid overtraining.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.140]   Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.600]   Today we're discussing recovery,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.840]   and I'm very excited to have this discussion
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.040]   because as we know,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.700]   despite the fact that different types of exercise
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.720]   can be used to trigger different types of adaptation,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.140]   such as increased long distance, endurance,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.720]   anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, et cetera,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.500]   the workouts themselves are not actually
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.220]   when the progress occurs,
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.660]   when the adaptation occurs.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.920]   And this to me is extremely interesting
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.280]   because it parallels what we see
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.040]   with so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.500]   which is the nervous system's ability to change
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.440]   in response to experience.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.000]   We sit down to learn something,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   we experience something,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.080]   and that is the trigger for rewiring of the nervous system,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.320]   but the actual rewiring occurs away from the experience
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.760]   or the learning.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.100]   So too, in fitness and in exercise,
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.440]   recovery is where the real results actually emerge,
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   where we get better.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.240]   So I'd love for you to explain what recovery really is
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.960]   and the different types of recovery,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.320]   certainly different ways to enhance recovery.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840]   And I'd also love for you to explain
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.280]   whether or not there are ways
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   that people can become better at recovering,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.800]   because if indeed recovery is when progress emerges,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.860]   when we get better,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.760]   well then anything that supports our recovery
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.280]   and gets us better at recovering
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   ought to increase our rate and our degree of progress.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.120]   - Absolutely, you nailed it in the description.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.440]   What people really want is some sort of change,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.920]   whether we're talking athletes or general population,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   this change is some sort of improvement in muscle function,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.600]   reduction in body fat, higher functioning metabolism,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.640]   whatever the case is.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.320]   And the only way that happens is,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.480]   we talk about the equation of stress causes adaptation,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.660]   but as you alluded to,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.520]   the piece in the middle is only if you can recover from it.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.820]   And so the game we're playing here is,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.620]   we all agree we want more adaptation.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.740]   That means we need to bring more stress into the system,
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.820]   but we then have to ensure
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.520]   that our recovery outpaces the stress input
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.980]   or else no adaptation will occur.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.040]   In fact, what happens is you will actually be
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.660]   in a negative spot and start going backwards.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.280]   And so what I would love to do is talk about
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.740]   how we've handled this.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.560]   And I've had a decent amount of experience here.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.420]   I was fortunate enough to do my master's degree
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.260]   in the laboratory of a gentleman named Andy Fry,
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.320]   who's an NSCA Lifetime Achievement Award winner.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.940]   And he studied in large part recovery, overtraining,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.960]   overuse, overload in a lot of areas.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.700]   In addition, I've been fortunate enough to work
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.340]   with individuals from high functioning CEOs and executives
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.560]   who have little time for recovery, high job stress,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.520]   to athletes.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.360]   Think of the example of pitchers in Major League Baseball
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.420]   who have to recover in a matter of four days
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.140]   so that they can pitch again at maximum velocity.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.580]   So I would love to outline some of the tools and tactics,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.660]   strategies that we use for all these individuals,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.940]   give you some foundational stuff.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.200]   And I would love to maybe actually cover some things
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.080]   that most people have never heard of,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.220]   some stuff you may not have access to,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.080]   some technologies that we use, some biomarkers,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.680]   and then even a whole bunch of things
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.340]   that are keeping with the theme of your show here,
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.700]   cost-free or extremely low cost.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.880]   So all of those strategies.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.140]   What I would also like to do is cover nutrition,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140]   supplementation, and fueling and hydration and things,
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.780]   but that's probably going to have to be saved
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.500]   for an additional conversation
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.580]   that we'll do in the next episode.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.540]   - Yeah, so we will absolutely hold a conversation
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.140]   about nutrition and supplementation,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.940]   where you can educate us about all the top contour stuff,
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.400]   all the way down to the fine details.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.680]   I do have a question about recovery,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.580]   and it's one that I think most people are familiar
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.700]   with themselves, which is soreness.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.100]   We think of it as a muscle soreness,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.260]   but I was trained early on in my scientific career
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.060]   to always question the seemingly obvious.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.340]   So a couple of questions about soreness.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.660]   First of all, what does soreness really reflect?
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.680]   Is it really muscle soreness?
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100]   It feels like it's in the muscles,
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.380]   but what other organ systems and tissues and cell types
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.740]   does it involve?
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.240]   And then I'm particularly interested in this UNCEP,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.740]   or this experience that many of us, including myself, had,
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.520]   which is delayed onset muscle soreness.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.440]   Why would it be that when we are less in shape,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880]   or when we perform a movement
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.740]   that is extremely novel to us,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.900]   the soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.980]   of maybe even a day, we're fine the next day,
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.080]   but then 48 hours later, we are exceedingly sore.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.180]   And as we get more fit or more familiar with the movement,
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.020]   the soreness seems to arrive earlier.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.160]   So I realize I just asked you about three questions or more.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.960]   First of all, what is muscle soreness at a cellular level?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560]   Which cells, which organ systems and so forth?
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.280]   What does it mean if we are sore?
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.740]   Is something I know we'll get into a little bit later.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.260]   And then why the delayed onset muscle soreness?
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.860]   - It's actually one question.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.920]   So it's totally fine you asked all three,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.000]   because I'm going to actually answer number three,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.920]   which will answer number two,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.460]   which will actually answer number one.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.300]   - I'd love to tell you
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.240]   that I set it up that way intentionally,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.700]   but I'm just happy to hear
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.580]   that where I was unable to be concise,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.980]   you are able to be concise.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.420]   Thank you. - Yeah.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.740]   We are still learning a lot about this area.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.640]   It's actually really difficult to perform these studies.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.000]   Anytime you ask a question about something like pain
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.820]   or soreness, you're immediately talking about perception.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.780]   And there is obviously a physical component to that,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.280]   and there's also perception.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.720]   And so teasing those things out
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.140]   is extraordinarily challenging.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.420]   That said, there has been a lot of work in this area.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.000]   In fact, probably you may have a show already out on pain,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.780]   or maybe one's coming down the road.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.240]   - We did an episode on pain a while ago,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.220]   but it's definitely time to revisit that literature.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.440]   I also have some amazing colleagues at Stanford
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.600]   who work on pain, both from the cellular and molecular side,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.780]   but also from the psychological side
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   about how our understanding of pain
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.140]   and what we believe about pain shapes the experience
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.240]   of pain and pain relief.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.080]   - Amazing.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.860]   That stuff is incredibly important,
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.140]   and I'm glad we flagged that,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.020]   and maybe we'll just call that good for now.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.520]   They could come back later for another one of your shows.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.260]   So that being said, why does it happen
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.420]   28 to 48 hours after you exercise?
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.260]   Well, that actually should give you some clues
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.700]   into what's happening.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.420]   So the traditional dogma of delayed onset muscle soreness
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.380]   is what this is called, is that it is a result
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.460]   of quote unquote micro tears.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.300]   And the muscle.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.940]   And so you can sort of think, I challenged the muscle,
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.360]   there were some small tears in there,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.220]   and I'm feeling the results of that.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.320]   Well, in fact, that certainly does happen,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   and it can happen.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.980]   That is not what's explaining your muscle soreness.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.940]   And in fact, you can be quite sore from exercise
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.140]   and have no measurable amount of muscle damage.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.660]   And so much like anything else,
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.780]   when we're in this idea of pain,
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.160]   it's not a one-to-one explanation.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.500]   There are multiple factors that are probably causing
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.880]   your perception of pain.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.980]   Muscle damage can be one of them.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.220]   It is not the only one, and it is probably, in my opinion,
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.220]   though this is yet to be shown definitively,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.820]   probably not even the leading cause of it.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.880]   And so what's actually happening?
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.540]   Well, the reason it's taking you 24 to 48 hours
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.120]   is you can actually find various papers, literature reviews,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.240]   dating back a number of years now, over a decade,
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.180]   that show these wonderful curves of an inflammatory
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.260]   and immune response.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.660]   And we don't need to necessarily go through
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.980]   the entire physiology right now,
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.480]   but effectively what's happening is those things
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.300]   have a little bit of a time delay.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.940]   And so some of those steps happen immediately,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.320]   like right when the exercise is there,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.020]   and then some of them are delayed six to 24 to 48 hours.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.060]   If you know a little bit about this physiology,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.780]   you have a combination of neutrophils and macrophages
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.880]   and a bunch of things happening,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.060]   and this has a time sequence.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.240]   So what happens is by the time we get to this 28 to 48 hour
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.400]   window, now the muscle soreness kicks in.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.640]   Which, wait a minute, if this was a result
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.360]   of my muscles being torn, and that happened immediately,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.120]   wouldn't that pain start immediately?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.680]   Well, the answer is it would.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.440]   And so that is your first clue
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.300]   that that's not responsible for it.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.120]   When we look at that immune response and we see
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.440]   that that has actually peaked 24 to 48 hours later,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.080]   and then that's the same time the pain kicked in,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.220]   that's cooling you in with the problem.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.720]   So we have this immune response happening and inflammation,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.840]   then all of a sudden we start getting fluid accumulation.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.160]   And now there are what are called nociceptors,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.040]   and you're probably very, obviously you're very familiar
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.760]   with these, and these are your pain receptors.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.740]   What's actually interesting is we don't necessarily know
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.120]   a lot of information about how many pain receptors
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.060]   are in muscle.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.000]   They're not really in the belly.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.200]   In fact, this is why I can perform my muscle biopsies
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.240]   and they don't really hurt.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.540]   - You mean in the belly of the muscle?
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.840]   - Correct. - Yeah.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.800]   - We do have pressure sensors though.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.840]   And so if you change the volume of the tissue,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   you will respond to that very, very quickly.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.680]   So by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle,
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.280]   that is immediately putting pressure
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.240]   on those pressure receptors, if you will.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.080]   That's the signal.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.000]   So what's probably happening here,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.920]   and I just hate to give you another bone,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.800]   but a lot of delayed on some muscle soreness
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.340]   is probably just a neural feedback loop
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.480]   rather than it is actual muscle damage.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.420]   - Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.760]   There's a lot of interactions between the types of neurons
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.840]   that control touch sensation
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.060]   and pain sensation and itch sensation.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.680]   In fact, a lot of people kind of collapse
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.280]   itch and pain together.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.120]   - Bingo, yeah.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.280]   - You know, that's something it's painful
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.800]   and it itches is a familiar thing for people,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.240]   mosquito bites and such.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.960]   And then of course there's the classic gate theory of pain,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.080]   which people will be familiar with
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.160]   and then I'll explain why I'm explaining this,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.520]   which is if something hurts,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.960]   you know, you bonk your knee or you stub your toe,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.240]   we tend to grab that body part and try and rub it.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.080]   - Totally.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.420]   - And that rubbing is not a coincidental thing.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.200]   It activates a set of touch sensors
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.940]   that respond to kind of broad, dull touch.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.260]   And that actively inhibits
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.680]   through the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.720]   the fibers that control the pain signal.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.800]   So anytime we rub like a charley horse, our leg,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.360]   or we stub our toe and we wince and then we grab the toe
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.840]   and we kind of like squeezing it a little bit,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.520]   that's actually deactivating
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.160]   or partially inactivating the pain mechanism.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.480]   So the idea that a swelling response
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   would then trigger a neural response
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.360]   that then would recruit the pain receptor response.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.140]   Here I'm using broad brush strokes here to explain this.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.360]   Makes very good sense to me.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.020]   Now and only now that you've explained
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.140]   how this process works.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.360]   - I can actually even add more to that.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.220]   So if you remember how muscles work,
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.880]   so we have to have some sort of signal
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.160]   from the nervous system that has to actually go in
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.200]   and tell the muscle to contract.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.080]   Well, remember there a few episodes ago,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.240]   we covered the physiology here
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.200]   of what's called a motor unit.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.680]   Okay, well, what I didn't explain to you
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.040]   are called muscle spindles.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.000]   And we have talked about proprioception
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.280]   in an episode of before as well,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.500]   but we never tied this picture together.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.320]   So let me walk you through that really quickly
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   and it's gonna tie this loop into a nice bow.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.560]   So what happens is this motor unit is coming in
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   from what's called an alpha motor unit.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.400]   And that's gonna be innervating your muscle fibers.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.640]   And that's gonna tell the muscle fibers to contract.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.200]   Those are typically spread out
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.320]   throughout all sides of the muscle,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.740]   in interior, exterior, all over.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.040]   On the outside though, there is another type of muscle
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.460]   called a muscle spindle.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.840]   Now these are non-contractile,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.480]   so they don't have that actin and myosin
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.240]   and they don't produce force.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.080]   They are responsive, they're proprioceptive.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.800]   So what that means is they sense stretch.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.160]   And this is why, for example,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.800]   if you were to stretch a hamstring,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.640]   and stretch any muscle group,
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.720]   it doesn't really matter, or muscle,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.280]   its innate response is to fire back to close that distance.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.560]   And this is what keeps you from, say,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.880]   if you're leaning to the right.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.520]   You can imagine that the example we give is
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.560]   if you're standing on one foot
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   and you start swaying to the right, all right?
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.880]   Let's say you're standing on your right foot,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.600]   and this makes this easier for folks.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.620]   And you start swaying to the right,
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.160]   like you're gonna fall on your right ear,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.500]   will hit the ground.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.900]   The inside of your right calf muscle
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.500]   will start being stretched.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.180]   The outside will start being compressed, right?
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.920]   So the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.100]   will sense that stretch and it will respond by contracting.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.160]   That pulls you back to the middle
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.600]   and stops you from falling.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.800]   That's proprioception.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.240]   And muscle spindles sense stretch and tell you to contract.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.000]   The way that they work is through gamma motor neurons.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.240]   And so these are sensory things.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.360]   So what's happening is unlike when you tell your muscle
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.400]   to contract, it goes alpha to the muscle contract.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.520]   These muscle spindles work such that it is,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.100]   oh, I've been stretched, send signal back
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.840]   to some central point, typically in the spinal cord,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.720]   and we don't actually wanna go all the way up to the brain.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.240]   We've got a time delay.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.160]   This is why these are subconscious, autonomic, right?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.600]   Versus somatic.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.440]   So the gamma is gonna go back to the central location
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.520]   and then come back through the alpha motor neurons
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.960]   and tell it to contract.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.520]   So you have those wonderful mechanism
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.880]   of sensing stretch going back.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.840]   Well, one theory that's been put forward
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.580]   regarding muscle damage is that the pressure
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.180]   is actually being applied to those nerve endings
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.940]   of the muscle spindles.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.400]   And that's actually responsible for the pain signal
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.000]   that's going back and coming up to your brain.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.180]   You're registering that as pain rather than it is actually
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.980]   in the contractile units, so the muscle fibers.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.120]   - That's a very intriguing idea
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.020]   because it would suggest that stretching muscles
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.140]   in order to alleviate soreness
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.040]   might be the exact incorrect thing to do.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.980]   Now, I'm not saying that for certain.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.200]   I'm just building off the mechanistic logic
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.280]   that we've laid out here, really, that you've laid out here.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.560]   - There is the more effective principle
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.960]   based on exactly that, which is,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.460]   this is generally why low-level movement
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.360]   is effective at reducing acute soreness.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.520]   - Because that's low-level contraction of the muscles,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.600]   anti-stretch. - And you're going to contract
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.200]   and get tissue out, and you're going to get fluid out.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.000]   - Wow.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.360]   - You're literally pumping it out of the cell.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.960]   - Yes, and in our previous episode
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.600]   where we were talking about programming,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.040]   we're using the we, but let's be fair here,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.680]   where you were educating us, including me,
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.880]   in the audience about different structures for programming,
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.960]   exercise for specific adaptations, et cetera,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.260]   the month, week, year, scales, et cetera,
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.140]   we had a brief discussion about the fact
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.940]   that if one trains legs very hard with resistance training,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.800]   you know, some heavy squatting or deadlifting it,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.980]   and there's some soreness
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.860]   that oftentimes doing some, quote, unquote, lighter cardio,
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.900]   or some low-impact work the next day,
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.660]   or any number of different things
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.460]   that involve not high-intensity contractions of the muscles,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.220]   but that do require contractions of the muscles,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.800]   that it can alleviate soreness more quickly
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.500]   than if one were to simply lie around
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.180]   and, you know, watch a Netflix or something.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.620]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.400]   To go back just a little bit as well,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.820]   if that's really the case, the question is, like,
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.140]   where is this inflammatory signal coming from?
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.760]   And while there's much to be learned there,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.800]   there is a little bit of information right now
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.680]   that suggests it's potentially coming from free radicals
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.340]   released from the mitochondria.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.080]   Again, that may or may not hold up as more research comes,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.920]   I'm not sure, but if you remember back
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.040]   to our conversation on endurance,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.280]   so we talked about the electron transport chain
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.000]   and aerobic metabolism, and regardless of whether or not
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.360]   you're getting energy from glycolysis or carbohydrates,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.960]   remember, they have to be finished
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.240]   through aerobic metabolism.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.760]   So even if you're lifting weights
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.180]   and you're using carbs for your fuel,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.120]   you have got to finish that metabolism
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.640]   by running it into the mitochondria
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.200]   and performing oxidative metabolism.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.380]   As a result of that, that electron transport chain runs.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.320]   So theoretically, if free radicals,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.440]   which are hyper-reactive oxygen species,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.420]   basically they're oxygen molecules
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.400]   that are missing an electron
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.560]   so that they react to a lot of things,
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.520]   they're the opposite of antioxidants, by the way,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.920]   this is the oxygen molecules with extra protons
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.640]   so they can balance the charge.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.880]   If those leak out, that in and of itself
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.040]   is going to be a massive inflammatory signal,
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.780]   and that's probably what signals the cause
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.560]   of these neutrophils and macrophages
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.600]   and kicks off this entire cascade.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.900]   Again, I believe we need more research there,
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.760]   I need to look into it,
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.220]   maybe it's more definitive than I know,
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.840]   but that's probably what's happening,
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.080]   potentially what's happening, rather,
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.400]   that causes that cascade in signal.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.520]   Also, what you have is this combination of,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.920]   well, if that's the case,
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.440]   why am I not getting tremendous amount of muscle damage
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.080]   when I do more aerobic-based exercise?
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.320]   Well, because you don't have the mechanical tension
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.520]   pulling on the fibers
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.040]   that's actually causing damage to the cell wall
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.640]   that allows these free radicals
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.140]   to escape the mitochondria and the cell wall.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.760]   So that's the best we can postulate at this moment
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.680]   as to why those things are happening,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.720]   and then why, again, low-level exercise
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.520]   tends to enhance even things like percussion.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.760]   So using either instruments
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.280]   that put a low level of vibration into your leg
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.320]   or like pneumatic boots, so you can massage,
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.240]   all these things are generally probably helping
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.360]   because they're moving that stuff out,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.820]   edema most specifically,
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.520]   so pressure comes off of those nerve endings
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.400]   in the muscle spindles
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.080]   and allows you to stop receiving that signal of pain
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.920]   despite the fact
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.860]   that you didn't actually regenerate tissue at all yet.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.080]   - Fascinating, and I think that beautifully frames
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.960]   where we're headed next,
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.320]   which is to talk about all the different modes of recovery
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.240]   and how to accelerate them,
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.840]   and perhaps even how to combine different forms of recovery
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080]   in order to become better at recovering
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.360]   and in doing so, make faster progress with fitness.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.060]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.680]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.020]   It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin's
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.360]   teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.720]   It is, however, part of our desire and effort
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.260]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.880]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.680]   we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.000]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.280]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.600]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.720]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.680]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.400]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.460]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.880]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.340]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.440]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.220]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.520]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.000]   and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.320]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.280]   And this is, of course, important because we realized
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.300]   that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.280]   reside outside the United States.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.200]   If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.000]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, in particular supplements
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.180]   for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.360]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.000]   including exercise recovery,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.120]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.840]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.120]   Element is an electrolyte drink that contains
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.260]   the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium,
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.320]   magnesium, and potassium to optimize cellular functioning
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.100]   for mental and physical performance.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.080]   Most people realize that hydration is key.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.180]   We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.440]   and perform our best.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   But what most people do not realize
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.700]   is that the proper functioning of our cells
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.820]   and nerve cells, neurons in particular,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.320]   requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.680]   in the correct ratios.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.800]   Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.960]   need to be careful about their sodium intake.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.720]   But what a lot of people don't realize
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.600]   is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.160]   and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.120]   that is not a lot of processed foods,
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.220]   which of course is a good thing,
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.100]   chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium,
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.880]   and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.580]   Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1000 milligrams,
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.500]   that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.620]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.000]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.740]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.860]   to get a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.700]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.280]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.160]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.820]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.440]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.300]   I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.860]   for about the last eight months,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.220]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.980]   I'm sleeping about the same amount,
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.340]   but I'm sleeping far deeper,
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.380]   and I'm now getting the proper ratios
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.420]   and slow wave sleep, and waking up feeling
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.900]   far more recovered mentally and physically.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.920]   The underlying mechanism for all that
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.060]   is very straightforward.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.680]   I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.960]   about the critical relationship
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.220]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.140]   That is, in order to fall asleep at night,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.580]   your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.000]   in terms of core body temperature,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.100]   and waking up involves a one to three degree increase
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.400]   in core body temperature.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.020]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.580]   you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.040]   to be one temperature at the start of the night,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.820]   a different temperature the middle of the night,
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.980]   and a different temperature as you approach morning,
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.440]   each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.280]   and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.500]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.860]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.500]   and check out their pod three cover

[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.900]   United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.100]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.180]   So to kick off this discussion about recovery,
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.220]   and with the understanding that recovery
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.700]   is when the specific adaptations to exercise actually occur,
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.540]   I'd love for you to share with us
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.060]   what happens or needs to happen during recovery
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.820]   in order for us to get better at anything,
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.460]   endurance, strength, et cetera,
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:09.500]   but also how specific types of exercise stimuli
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.420]   and specific types of adaptations that we trigger,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.900]   so running a bit further, lifting a bit more weight,
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.260]   slowing the cadence of a given movement, et cetera,
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.380]   how those specific types of triggers for adaptation
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.380]   relate to the specific or maybe similar types of recovery
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.020]   that are required for us to make progress.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.280]   In one of our previous episodes,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.480]   we were talking about how the Harvard Fatigue Lab
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   really identified this idea of homeostasis,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.660]   or at least sort of championed it for it.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.780]   And that's important because in all levels,
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.900]   physiology wants to return to homeostasis.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.660]   So what happens in terms of adaptation
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.580]   is you challenge it to a level that it realizes
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.380]   if it does not make a change,
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.940]   it will not be able to get back
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.260]   to the same level of homeostasis.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.100]   That's fundamentally what's happening.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.880]   That is recovery.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.640]   That process of taking an insult,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.500]   being temporarily reduced in functionality,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.700]   causing a change so that now we come back
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.880]   and get what we often call in sport performance,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.860]   super compensation.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.040]   All that really is doing though
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.200]   is bringing you to a new level of homeostasis.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.040]   Effectively, it is understanding
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.640]   if that same insult comes again,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.840]   I need to be able to make sure
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.720]   that that doesn't cause the same level of disruption.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.660]   And so we raise the bar,
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.100]   whether this is enhancing our ability
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.760]   to take the same level of mechanical tension on the muscle
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.820]   and not result in micro damage,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.160]   whether this is being able
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.360]   to take the same reduction in energy
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.820]   and not have that compromise of sleep or anything.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.860]   It's really fundamentally changing
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.920]   so that we can have a new level of homeostasis
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.480]   because it's presuming,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.420]   it's predicting that that same insult
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.320]   is going to come again down the road.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.920]   - I wanted to clarify for people
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.140]   that when Dr. Galvin says insult,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.800]   while he may actually insult me,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.440]   insult is the nerd speak terminology
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.960]   for some sort of damage inflicted to a tissue or system.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.240]   So he's speaking about the insult to the muscle
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.440]   or insult to the neuromuscular connection
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.560]   created by adding more weight to the bar,
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.120]   running a further distance,
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.680]   running a bit faster or pedaling faster.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.780]   That creates a micro insult or an insult.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.400]   And now, because everyone is familiar
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   with psychological and verbal insults,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.500]   you'll never forget that biological concept.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.740]   - It's important we tag another thing here,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.060]   which is called hormesis.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.520]   It's one of my favorite phenomenon.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.800]   And it effectively means this,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.720]   that there is a dosage or toxicity response
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.640]   to almost everything.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.180]   And if you think about this in the context of say drugs,
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.660]   what this means is if I gave you 10 milligrams of something
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.560]   that it would be okay.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.480]   But if I gave you 20, it'd be a problem.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.040]   And eventually if I go up and give you enough,
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.360]   this thing turns toxic.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.960]   This is a case of everything from cyanide,
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.760]   where it can actually be in small dosages in nature.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.080]   In fact, it's in many of the fruits that you eat,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.920]   but it's at a dosage that it doesn't matter.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.300]   If that dosage gets higher though,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.720]   that actually can cause problems.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.080]   And if it is high enough,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.420]   it can actually kill you instantaneously.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.680]   The back end of that though,
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.280]   is because you introduced this micro insult,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.880]   as you framed it for me perfectly,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.120]   your body will then adapt to it.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.400]   And that's really what's happening
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.960]   with exercise adaptation is it is a hormetic stressor.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.120]   And why that's important is,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.080]   if you look at the immediate responses to exercise,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.520]   you see an extremely large increase in inflammation.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.180]   You see oxidative stress.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.200]   You see a whole cascade of autophagy,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.920]   like all these problems, quote unquote, happen.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.380]   And what's actually quite funny here is,
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.340]   as a part of my PhD, the academic portion,
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.160]   I had to go through the medical side of the school.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.040]   And so I was, my physiology class was in med school.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.680]   So I'm the only non-medical doctor in that class.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.420]   I'm a PhD, so I leave my lab, I walk across campus,
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.500]   and I take physiology class with these folks.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.400]   And I died the whole time internally,
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.600]   because every time we would cover a new area,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.240]   it was basically the exact same value or number.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.480]   In a medical setting is like,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.680]   oh my gosh, they're going to die.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.200]   And in a performance setting is like,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.360]   this person's in fantastic shape.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.920]   It's like, I never, it still amuses me to this day,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.360]   obviously, because it's just simple things
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.520]   like total blood volume, right?
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.880]   And you cover like, okay, if you have a patient come in,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.860]   their blood volume is six liters.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.700]   You know, I can immediately get them
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.600]   on a diuretic of some sort,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.480]   because they're going to have a heart attack
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.400]   as blood pressure gets up, right?
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.200]   And I'm immediately thinking, damn, six liters,
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.980]   that person is super fit.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.380]   Because that is actually a positive adaptation to training.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.460]   It's one of the most important,
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.820]   if not the most important, adaptation to endurance training
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.240]   is enhanced total blood volume.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.140]   So you'll store more blood in your body
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.600]   when you're more fit than you are less fit.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.960]   So I'm going to go on.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.700]   All these things, sodium concentrations,
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.200]   potassium concentrations are like,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.680]   you look at these things on paper
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.520]   and you don't know if that person's about to die,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.720]   'cause they're 65 years old and out of shape,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.240]   or if that person's going to break a world record
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.080]   in the marathon.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.760]   - This brings up a very important tangent,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.040]   which is, for instance, if you go and take a blood test
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.640]   and you are somebody who exercises very intensely
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.160]   with resistance training,
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.400]   your blood creatinine levels can be way out of range.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.920]   And if your physician doesn't know
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.060]   that you're doing certain forms of exercise might say,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.880]   wow, there's a lot of muscle tissue damage
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.640]   occurring in your body.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.480]   As you mentioned before,
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.440]   your total blood volume is dangerously high
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.140]   when in fact you are far healthier and indeed much fitter
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.720]   than the person who has numbers would be in range.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   That said, obviously there are limits to these statements
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.280]   whereby you would want to be cautious
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.400]   and take action to ameliorate a very elevated
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.640]   blood creatinine level or something of that sort.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.080]   But the point you're bringing up is also one
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.200]   about the field of medicine,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.220]   which is that many, not all, but many physicians
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.980]   don't take into consideration the outside activities
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.820]   that people are doing.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.720]   And so it becomes a kind of a plug and play type way
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.600]   of looking at blood charts.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   - We've done many thousand athletes blood chemistry
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.840]   and we don't use, first of all,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.440]   we never look at disease stuff.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.280]   That's not what we do.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.100]   We take people that are healthy
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.180]   and try to optimize performance.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.120]   And blood chemistry is one of the best tools.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.220]   If you really understand what you're doing there,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.360]   you can get some incredibly powerful information
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.200]   out of blood chemistry.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.880]   But that actually relates to what we're gonna talk to today
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.200]   in terms of measuring everything from acute
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.560]   to chronic dehydration, to sleep deprivation
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.120]   can be identified in blood chemistry,
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.460]   to optimization improvements in nutrition supplementation.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.800]   There's just a lot you can get there.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.860]   I mean, if people are interested in that field,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.860]   I would point them to a gentleman named Dan Garner,
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.120]   who was just an absolute juggernaut wizard
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.160]   in blood chemistry for high performance.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.640]   But you can get a ton of information from that.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.760]   If you understand the difference between exactly
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.580]   what you talked about, looking for signals of increased risk
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.920]   of cardiovascular events 25 years down the road
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.960]   versus is this the optimal value for high performance
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.440]   in an athlete, which is what our database
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.760]   and all of our software and stuff does
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.400]   is only looking for those things.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.800]   So I'm gonna talk about some of the biomarkers
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.840]   to look for a little bit later.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.160]   Salivary stuff, some blood stuff,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.020]   but we'll maybe save that part of the conversation
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.040]   for down the road.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.900]   - Tell me about different timescales of recovery.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.120]   - Sure, this is actually where I was trying
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.000]   to answer your question for,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.320]   and then I got myself way off track.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.080]   But the reason I brought up the hormetic thing
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.480]   is if you understand that some things in the acute,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   say 24 to 48 hour period, look terrible,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.520]   it's actually fine, right?
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.040]   So this is the stimuli that's causing adaptation.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.920]   So the reason I brought up the medical exchange there
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.840]   is because if you looked at inflammatory markers,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.100]   and then you mentioned some of them,
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.920]   you would see that they are highest acute
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.320]   within seconds to minutes to hours after exercise.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.560]   However, that's exactly the stimuli needed
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.600]   to bring them down chronically.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.920]   Okay, and so chronically meaning maybe
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.280]   in that moment they are elevated,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.160]   and then maybe they're coming down 24 hours later
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.560]   or 48 hours, however, if you were to compare
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.960]   your resting level, say that Monday before you worked out,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.360]   to your resting level that Monday, the week following,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   the week following that, what you would probably see
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.100]   is your baseline inflammation goes down.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.400]   And so we gotta be really careful.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.520]   Are we talking immediately post exercise?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.640]   Man, these markers look terrible.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.120]   Maybe my recovery score is awful.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.800]   So that's not necessarily a bad thing
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.280]   because what we're looking to do is to not only change
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.180]   what's happening today, but we're trying
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.760]   to cause adaptation that may take us weeks
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.380]   or months to actually access.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.020]   - I love that you're highlighting this principle
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.080]   because one of the more obvious ones to me now
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.600]   that you've said this is heart rate.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.440]   - Absolutely.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.800]   - If my heart rate goes very, very high during exercise,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.840]   and I do that fairly consistently or even semi-consistently,
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.600]   my resting heart rate will actually be quite a bit lower.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.920]   - That's a fantastic example.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.720]   Really what you're getting at here is this concept
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.360]   where I think it's important to differentiate
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.860]   between adaptation and optimization.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.500]   Now we hear that word, and I use it,
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.620]   and most scientists hate it,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.180]   but it's a good communication tool, optimization.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:22.340]   If you're optimizing for the current moment,
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.580]   you're almost surely compromising delayed adaptation.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.080]   If I were to say do the thing right now
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.220]   that makes you feel the absolute best in the world,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.860]   and you're like great, you took a nap and you ate a donut,
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.200]   like awesome, you feel amazing.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.520]   But you know it's causing long-term issues.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.140]   The same can be said in the backend.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.500]   If you're never choosing things
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.740]   that make you better right now,
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.640]   you're never actually going to see any adaptation.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.360]   So what we're really doing with this recovery conversation
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   is playing this game of balancing immediate gratification
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   with delayed gratification.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.240]   And how do we identify how much to do now versus not?
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.440]   How do I use a value or a marker,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.760]   whether this is how tired I feel today,
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.040]   how sore I am today, versus a score on an app
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.600]   or a tracking metric, whether this is a blood marker,
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.020]   anything, and understand if that's what I need
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.140]   to cause the adaptation I want a week, a month,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:17.980]   three months from now.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.280]   In the case of some of our other athletes,
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.480]   it's even up to four years, right?
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.640]   We're trying to cause adaptations that will get us
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.920]   where we want to get in the Olympics or World Championships
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.880]   or World Cup or wherever we're going to be.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.800]   So that's the framework we have to think about recovery.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.480]   We maybe falsely think about it as
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.240]   I need to maximize my recovery today.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.700]   And you could do something like take an anti-inflammatory,
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.680]   whether this is a supplementation or a drug,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.220]   or maybe this is ice.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.720]   Oh, cool, that's great.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.040]   That will enhance your recovery in this moment.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.320]   That'll make you feel better today, probably tomorrow.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.160]   But what we know is that blocks the signal for adaptation.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.080]   So you're not going to get the same results
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.860]   four, six, eight weeks from now.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.480]   So when we talk about recovery,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.440]   we have to understand what tool am I using and why.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.320]   And in order to do that, we have to understand
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.520]   what am I training for and what am I trying to maximize?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   If I am in the middle of a season with an athlete
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.200]   and we are competing tomorrow,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.760]   I am going to hedge towards acute recovery, right?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.700]   'Cause I have to actuate that performance right now.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.960]   If I am starting the off season,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.520]   I'm not hedging towards recovery.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.460]   I'm actually hedging towards adaptation.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.280]   So we're not going to deploy any of these,
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.680]   especially things like there's evidence that a combination
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.080]   of vitamin C and vitamin E will blunt
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.640]   hypertrophic adaptations,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.600]   because they're anti-inflammatory, they're antioxidants.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.200]   Other studies have shown maybe they don't have
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.480]   an inhibitory effect, they may or may not.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.580]   Point is conceptually, you want to be careful
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.660]   of what you're trying to optimize for.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.280]   And you have to have that forethought
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.560]   and that alone is going to dictate your decision-making
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.480]   with whether or not again, you get in the eyes,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.320]   you do that.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.160]   We will cover some tools like massage
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.640]   that are pretty fine to use.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.800]   You don't have to worry about those
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.440]   blocking long-term adaptation,
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.800]   but others you're going to want to be very careful about.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.320]   - So this principle that you've laid out for us,
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.040]   which is that there's a set of events
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.440]   that occur during exercise that trigger the adaptation.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.920]   And that sets in motion a number of adaptations
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.320]   that occur during recovery
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.400]   that then give us the exact opposite response
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   to what the trigger was.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.640]   So I'll go back to the heart rate example.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.400]   Heart rate is close to maximal or maximal.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.980]   You do that enough times within a week or so or two weeks
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.540]   and your resting heart rate goes down.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.040]   As I recall, a few episodes ago,
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.820]   you said that your maximum heart rate
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.760]   doesn't really change that much.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.600]   Is that correct?
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.420]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.780]   But your resting heart rate can go down quite a bit.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.620]   - Yep.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.460]   - Is that a general theme?
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.340]   Meaning, do we have a more or less set upper limit
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.460]   or ceiling for things like inflammatory markers
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.900]   for heart rate, maybe even things like stress?
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.840]   And what we do when we deliberately trigger stress
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.060]   or a dramatic increase in heart rate
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.180]   or dramatic increase in inflammatory markers
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.140]   is that we are lowering the floor,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.100]   but that the ceiling remains the same.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.420]   - It's very dependent upon the marker.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.140]   So in the case of maximum heart rate,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.040]   it will not change with the exception of one thing,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.580]   which is age.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.000]   Age brings it down.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.300]   Training will not change it up in most circumstances.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.160]   If you look at something like an inflammatory response,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.420]   I suppose theoretically there is a ceiling,
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.100]   though I'm not aware of it.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.020]   I can tell you right now looking at blood markers
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.400]   of things like creatine kinase.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.660]   So remember the conversation about metabolism
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.740]   and that we use the phosphocreatine
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.860]   as one of our primary fuel sources for explosive exercise.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.720]   Well, if we're using phosphocreatine,
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.140]   this creatine kinase, remember kinase are enzymes
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.820]   that function to break things down for the most part.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.380]   So creatine kinase is the enzyme
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.180]   you use to break down creatine.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.480]   When you do that a lot, then that creatine kinase
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.940]   gets out of muscle and seeps into the blood.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.820]   Myoglobin is actually another fantastic marker by the way.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.420]   Myoglobin is, if you think about hemoglobin being in blood
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   is the molecule that carries oxygen around.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.500]   When it's in the muscle tissue, then it's myoglobin.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.300]   Myo meaning muscle and it's the same globulin thing.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.300]   So there's a bunch of markers
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.220]   you can look at muscle breakdown.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.860]   And one of the things that you can see
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.500]   is a creatine kinase level that's elevated
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.740]   after say one bout of exercise
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.940]   and it might be up five or six fold.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.740]   I've actually seen this number in offensive linemen
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.280]   in the NFL be something like 500 plus fold.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.940]   So even within just one category to the next,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.220]   that number can get extraordinarily high.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.320]   And if you know, this is actually one important point here.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.400]   If you're paying attention to any mechanistic research
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.820]   or you're using that to inform your decision making,
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.100]   you have to be extraordinarily careful of magnitude.
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.220]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.940]   if I were to be running a Western blot
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.260]   looking at a signaling protein in a muscle,
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.740]   did this activation of this protein
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.420]   turn on mitochondrial biogenesis?
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.980]   And I saw that whatever intervention we gave it,
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.060]   whether it was a nutrition thing or a drug
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.180]   or an exercise.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.140]   And I saw that that signaling protein increased by 20%.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.260]   I would basically assume that
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.920]   to be totally physiologically irrelevant.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.300]   Because in order for that to be important,
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.940]   it totally depends on the marker you're looking at.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.780]   But some markers I might need to see
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.220]   four or five, six hundred fold increase
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.540]   before I know that that will actually be enough
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.540]   to be what we call physiologically relevant.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.740]   Others, if they're up one or two percent, that is relevant.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.540]   And so you really wanna be careful
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.380]   when you're either reading papers
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.780]   or looking at social media stuff.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.920]   If people are just talking about
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.540]   this marker increased this much, it may not matter.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.140]   It may be totally irrelevant physiologically.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.020]   And so you have to, that does also,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.140]   if you're wondering how the hell are all these people,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.440]   well, that's how they can trick you a little bit.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   Intentionally or not.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.680]   It could be just they're trying their best,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.620]   but they don't really understand that area enough.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.480]   And so that's an important point to pay attention to.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.380]   So to answer your question again fully,
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.780]   it would be hard to determine
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.500]   if there is truly a maximum level.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.200]   Some things don't wanna move, like blood pH.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.220]   It doesn't really wanna move.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.540]   The range that you're gonna move from
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.260]   is like 6.8 to 7.4.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.220]   And if you get up to like 7.9,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.460]   you're probably in big, big, big trouble.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.920]   Other things, again, can go up 500, 5,000 fold.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.820]   And so the markers will really determine that answer.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.540]   - Well, at some point in the future,
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.940]   I'd love to continue this discussion
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.460]   around the topic of stress specifically.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.060]   And maybe we will get into that a little bit later today
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.260]   when we get into the use of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.100]   because that certainly has effects
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.260]   related directly to temperature on tissue,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.060]   but it certainly has mental effects
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:07.400]   in terms of raising one's level of perceived pain.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.240]   - It's fun.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.460]   - Some people love it,
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.420]   and some people love it for the feeling they get during it.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.340]   Deliberate cold exposure,
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.620]   some people only like it for the feeling they get after it.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.420]   Not unlike exercise.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.500]   I love to train, I love exercise,
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.840]   but I know many people who, they loathe exercise,
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.860]   but they love the feeling afterward.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.440]   So this will be a theme that we will come back to.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.940]   Thank you for indulging my interest in that semi-tangent.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.060]   I think it's a relevant tangent if there is such a thing.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.940]   If you can now return us to the different time scales
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.700]   and modes of recovery,
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.300]   'cause I think where we are headed is
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.440]   how to get better at recovering.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.100]   - Yep, let's talk about the tools,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.360]   let's talk about what to measure and identify
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.020]   for all four of these distinct levels.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.060]   So level one is what we call overload.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.900]   And just very quickly, what that means is
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.540]   I did a workout today.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.860]   The sign and symptom of overload is you're fatigued,
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.760]   acute performance is down.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.280]   So I worked out hard right now.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.420]   If I were to go try to do a maximum effort,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.540]   I would be reduced in my ability.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:17.340]   The recovery period for acute overload is minutes to days.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.060]   Right, that's generally what we call acute overload.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.340]   And that's what we're looking for, right?
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.420]   So we, systems should theoretically
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.100]   see that hormetic stressor, come back in response,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.940]   come back bigger, better, more efficient, et cetera.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.980]   If you were to continue training in that state,
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.420]   like most of us do, and say I did a workout today,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.240]   I had a little bit of acute overload.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.620]   Gonna work out again tomorrow,
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.780]   a little more acute overload.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   Gonna work out the next day, a little more acute overload.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.780]   Even if you took a day in between, it's,
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.620]   that doesn't matter, right?
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.580]   You just continue these acute bouts of insult.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.140]   Then you're gonna be pushing into
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.880]   the absolute golden target,
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.140]   which is what we call functional overreaching.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.200]   So you have overreached what you can currently do,
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.460]   and it results in a functional outcome.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.900]   And what we mean functionally here
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.020]   is performance is enhanced.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.920]   And again, performance being whatever you deem it to be.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.540]   You're stronger, you've enhanced muscle size,
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.600]   your mitochondria has improved, whatever the thing is.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.440]   It's not just a physical performance thing, right?
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.760]   Amazing.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.000]   Recovery time for functional overreaching
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.940]   is typically a few days to maybe even a week or so.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.860]   And so typically what we see happen
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.300]   is prior to a competition,
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.180]   individuals will do what we call a taper,
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.220]   which is a reduced training volume
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.300]   for some short period of time.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.780]   And the reason they do that is to, again,
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.860]   actualize is the phrase we use here,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.860]   the adaptations.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.800]   And so you worked hard for six weeks,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.420]   and theoretically the workouts you did
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.480]   three, four, five, six weeks ago,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.980]   once you allow the system to recover,
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.100]   will be actualized,
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.220]   which means your performance will be enhanced here.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.380]   So functional overreaching is the golden target.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.220]   If you were to be at the point of functional overreaching
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.980]   and you continue to train,
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.100]   so it intensified,
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.740]   whether this is through intensity, this is through volume,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.580]   or really, as you said earlier,
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.540]   you had something holding back your recovery.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.100]   It doesn't really matter, right?
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.700]   It's sort of two sides of the same coin.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.860]   Then you would move into what we call
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.780]   non-functional overreaching.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.700]   So you've overreached again,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.220]   but now it is non-functional,
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.460]   as in you did not see a positive benefit
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.820]   once recovery allowed.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.380]   This typically means you have weeks,
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.980]   it takes weeks to come back from,
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.420]   and you basically just get back to baseline.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.140]   And this is where a lot of folks are
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.340]   who end up in this vicious cycle.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.540]   And so you're like, man,
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.420]   I'm not getting the results I want,
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.220]   I'm going to train harder.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.380]   I'm not getting results I want,
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.620]   I'm gonna train harder and harder.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.820]   But because recovery isn't improved,
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.340]   you just end up in the same spot,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.180]   so then you train more,
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.020]   and you end up in the same spot,
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.260]   and you end up then just either blowing up or quitting,
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.100]   and you're not getting where you want.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.620]   If you were to continue past that point,
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.340]   you may actually be in what we actually call overtraining.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.900]   And that typically is considered to be overtrained
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.380]   if it takes months to recover from.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.660]   So most people think they're overtrained,
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.060]   are really not,
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.220]   you're just probably non-functionally overreached.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.700]   And again, the classic distinction is
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.220]   if you took three or four days off and you felt better,
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.740]   you weren't probably quote unquote overtrained.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.300]   You were probably just in this area
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.460]   of non-functional overreaching,
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.620]   you need a little bit of a back off.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.420]   If you, and this has been the case,
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.580]   I've had this happen with gymnasts and a cheerleader
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.980]   and some other things where they take a month off
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.620]   and we're barely seeing them start to come back
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.900]   to their baseline numbers in any number of areas,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.740]   mood, desire to train, testosterone, cortisol ratios,
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.380]   bowel markers in a number of areas, physical performance,
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.860]   vertical jump height, like all these things,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.500]   they just start to get back to baseline.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.420]   So true overtraining is actually quite rare.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.900]   Non-functional overreaching is much more common,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.100]   and it is a shorter timeframe scale.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.460]   So when we talk about recovery,
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.780]   those are the four pieces that we're really thinking about.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.780]   So if you are concerned about, oh, I'm super sore,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.140]   how do I get less sore?
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.060]   How do I either not be a sore,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.460]   next time I do that same workout,
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.620]   or I'm super sore and now how do I recover?
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.660]   Those are playing in that first category of overload.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:20.900]   And we can certainly talk about how to figure that out,
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.540]   but the quick answer is,
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.900]   you gotta go back to our previous episodes
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.740]   and just pay attention
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.260]   to the volume intensity recommendations.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.580]   If you're getting significantly more damage
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.500]   or fatigue in a workout,
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.980]   you probably have increased your volume too quickly,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.880]   or something else is dragging your stress bucket down.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.820]   But generally, this is a problem of training.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.060]   You either didn't warm up sufficiently,
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.900]   your fueling strategy is off,
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.180]   which we'll talk about in the next episode,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.940]   or you've violated one of our principles
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.740]   of increasing intensity and volume sort of too quickly.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.780]   If it's past that and you're getting to a stage
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.080]   where you're just like, I'm feeling beat up all the time,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.300]   my energy is going down,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.180]   I'm just not feeling like I'm recovered,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.840]   now we're in this overreaching stage.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.420]   So the story I kind of tell here always
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.420]   is a few years ago I was working
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.780]   and my wife Natasha was in the garage training
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.700]   and I'm doing something and she comes stumbling
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.240]   and she has this look on her eyes
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.220]   and her eyeballs are giant, she's just like wobbling.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.660]   She's like, "I effed up."
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.100]   I was like, "What do you mean you effed up?"
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.980]   And she's just like, "I read the program wrong."
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.580]   And she's like, "What'd you do?"
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.760]   She was supposed to be doing 10 sets of three
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.260]   every minute on the minute,
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.180]   and she did three sets of 10 every minute on the minute.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.220]   And she was absolutely wrecked.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.840]   She couldn't move for a few hours afterwards,
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.020]   and then for days she's just like,
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.900]   "You have to handle the kids, I can't get out of bed,
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.940]   "I can't move."
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.160]   So that was a classic example of,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.080]   all right, we don't need to fix recovery here,
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.340]   you're just a dummy and you did the training
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.800]   way too hard, too long, this is not,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.700]   we don't have a problem here.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.880]   So if it's a situation like that,
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.900]   it's generally you just, the program was way off.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.920]   If it's constantly happening,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.880]   where you're just like, man, for whatever reason,
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.480]   every once in a while I'm getting really sore
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.660]   or having a really bad performance in these workouts,
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.000]   then we need to go to our other stress bucket,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.540]   take a look at our allostatic load or allostasis
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.000]   and get figured out what's happening there.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.620]   So those are the easy ways to flag acute overload problems.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.900]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.340]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.020]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.500]   and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.980]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.220]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012,
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.820]   so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.460]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.260]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.700]   once or twice a day is that it helps me meet
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.780]   all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.880]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.420]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.580]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.600]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.240]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.620]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.340]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.420]   to claim a special offer.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.960]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.380]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.020]   Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.580]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.960]   to claim the special offer.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.240]   I'm happy that you pointed out the distinction
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.480]   between functional overreaching,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.120]   over-training, and being over-trained.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.520]   I think one common mistake that people make
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.840]   in thinking about biology generally
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.680]   is that they think in terms of nouns and adjectives
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.580]   and not verbs.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.660]   - Amazing, I love that so much.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:42.580]   - Biology is a collection of processes or processes,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.280]   depending on who you are and where you live
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.540]   and who you trained with.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:52.300]   Being over-trained is a state that in many ways
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.540]   is an adjective.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.460]   You're over-trained, I'm over-trained.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.940]   It's like saying, you know, I'm an American,
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.540]   I'm a Czechoslovakian, whatever it happens to be, right?
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.220]   And in many ways, people do start to associate
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.700]   with an identity, at least a transient identity,
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.380]   and they start making all sorts of decisions,
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.540]   it sounds like, about what sorts of verbs
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.400]   they will and will not engage in.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.700]   Whereas I think if we look at things as processes
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:21.300]   and we assign verbs to them, then we can say,
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.820]   okay, I'm functionally overreaching,
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.380]   or I'm truly over-training,
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.500]   which is just a matter of degrees, right?
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.400]   Or under-training, for that matter.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.500]   I'm not, I'm reaching, but I'm not functionally reaching.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.420]   It's just performance, and you know,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.780]   just as with the nervous system won't change
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.740]   unless you give it a reason to,
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.220]   this is the reason why if you can perform something
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.820]   perfectly or speak a language perfectly,
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.540]   there's no rewiring of the nervous system.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.900]   This myth that we've all been told
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.980]   that every experience rewires your nervous system,
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.880]   it's different now than it was two seconds ago,
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.580]   that's a ridiculous illogical statement.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.860]   We know that's not true.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.580]   If your nervous system can perform something,
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.660]   it has no reason to change and it won't.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.760]   - Muscle's the same way.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.820]   This is why you have to progressively overload.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.980]   You have to learn something new
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.820]   or challenge your muscle to do something new.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.100]   It's same thing.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.980]   - So in the example that you gave
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.440]   with your wife doing this workout
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.460]   that turned out to be far more strenuous,
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.420]   she had functionally overreach.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.100]   In some sense, she might've been over-training
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.460]   or heading in the direction of over-training,
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.860]   but the mistake would be to assume
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.980]   that she was over-trained, right?
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.700]   It almost becomes a bit of a state
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.760]   or a character assignment as opposed to a verb.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.660]   And in any case, there's no perfect way to describe this.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.140]   We're talking about nouns and adjectives
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.980]   and we're also talking about verbs,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.820]   but I think the verbs are really anchored down
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.500]   in processes and things that we do,
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.140]   actions that we can take.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   And so if I may, I'd like to just highlight this idea
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:51.140]   of shifting one's thinking towards verb actions
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.180]   rather than labels on the state that we happen to be in
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.280]   or the person that we happen to be, right?
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.940]   Sometimes it even does become kind of characterological
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.800]   in the way that people describe it.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.100]   And so I have to believe
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.020]   that there is something called over-training,
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.320]   that over-training is real in other words,
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.880]   but that we don't ever really know if we're over-trained.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.160]   - You nailed it.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.800]   - There's no, you know, it's not like a red flag,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.140]   you know, shoots up out of your shoulder
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.120]   and it's like, I'm over-trained, you know?
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.380]   So in doing so, I hope that we can start thinking
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.420]   about some of the verbs, the actions that we can all take
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.340]   in order to ensure that we stimulate progressive overload
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.720]   one way or another.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.420]   And at the same time that we don't fall into these bins
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.000]   of character assignment where suddenly we decide
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.260]   that we need to do X, like take a month off
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.100]   or something like that.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.740]   Because I'm beginning to realize from our discussion
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.240]   that that's exactly the wrong way to go.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.340]   - Those are fantastic points.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.660]   I wanna make sure it is clear
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.580]   that there is no clinical diagnoses for over-training.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.380]   There are no standards, there's no test
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.580]   or a blood panel you can pull
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.500]   that would actually identify you in that state.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.620]   So your distinction here, Andrew,
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.580]   of these are verbs rather than nouns is so wonderful
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.340]   'cause that is exactly the case.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.860]   The only way we could really come retroactively diagnose
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.960]   one with over-training is if, again,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.580]   we had you did weeks of recovery
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.860]   and you only got back to baseline.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.380]   So we can't do it in the moment.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.980]   I can't take a single test.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.340]   There's no subjective marker or anything
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.260]   that says you are over-trained.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.620]   It is simply, you are probably over-training
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.340]   and we need to reverse that quickly.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.580]   Or in the case of the step before,
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.600]   you are probably non-functionally overreaching.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.100]   And if you continue to do this,
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.540]   you will probably enter into a stage
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.900]   where this is your over-training and we need to come back.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.340]   So that's an important thing to let people know
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.800]   is there's no one thing we can actually point to
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.600]   that says you are here, you are not a noun, this is a verb.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.100]   - So what are some tools that we can use
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.580]   to enhance our recovery?
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.100]   - Yeah, let's start off with that acute overload phase.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.260]   So in other words, I just did a workout
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.140]   and I'm feeling awful, or I just did one,
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.260]   two days ago and I'm super sore.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.100]   How do I get rid of that right now?
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.940]   Well, there's a couple of things you can do immediately
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.400]   after your workout.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.840]   And then others that are maybe more actionable
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.240]   a day later or two days later.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.100]   And we'll just cover a handful of them.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.540]   We'll do some nutrition and hydration and supplementation
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.060]   in the next episode.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.920]   I'm gonna cover everything else
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.140]   not in that category right now.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.020]   So a couple of things.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:28.160]   Number one, you can actually start, kickstart
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.940]   that recovery process at the end
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.300]   of your current training session.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.800]   And I guess I should say it this way.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.460]   I strongly suggest you start this recovery process
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.300]   immediately after the workout.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.560]   You mentioned earlier about this idea of
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.200]   you gotta get a really high peak of stress
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.820]   to cause adaptation.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.480]   But I actually didn't explain that correctly
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.880]   'cause what has to happen is you need
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.220]   that extremely high peak, but then you have to be met
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.600]   with an extremely sharp recovery back down.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.780]   And so, you've talked about this before
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.660]   in some of your neuroplasticity stuff
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.700]   and in terms of what has to happen
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.800]   that caused the insult.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.140]   And then you immediately need to be able to recover
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.460]   to make sure that that causes changes in the brain.
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.500]   Same thing happens here.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.540]   So we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.980]   And then if you do not meet it
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.840]   with an immediate recovery period,
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.380]   the signal won't be there to maximize your results.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.240]   So what's that mean?
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.940]   You can actually do a couple of things.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:28.620]   Number one is actually listening to slow paced music.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.980]   There's evidence to suggest fast paced music
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.660]   may slow down your recovery
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.500]   and slow pace would actually enhance it.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.260]   So if you just change from your maximum,
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.660]   get you up and get going, music during the workout
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.780]   to a slower, lower cadence,
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.340]   that will help you kickstart the idea.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.420]   Of a similar note,
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.060]   you can also use what we call down regulation breathing.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.620]   You could do them in conjunction or one or the other,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.700]   whichever is up to you.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.220]   So my personal favorite method here
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   is somewhere between three to 10 minutes
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.580]   of finishing your training session,
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.140]   laying down, I'd like to be in that position.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.740]   You could certainly do it in the Lotus position,
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.660]   but I think laying on your back
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.280]   is generally more effective.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.300]   Personal preference there, no science.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.900]   I like the eyes being covered,
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.600]   getting into this dark, quiet sort of area.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.620]   And then just breathing through your nose
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.700]   in a structured cadence.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.380]   There's a lot of different things you can try.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.340]   An easy example is just box breathing.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.540]   So you can imagine box having four squares.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.340]   So what you're going to do is inhale
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.540]   for somewhere between like three to eight seconds.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.240]   And then whatever number you choose,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.180]   you keep that same tempo.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.940]   And so let's say you chose to do a five second inhale.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.260]   That's going to take you up vertically.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.620]   And then horizontally for your box is a five second hold.
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.380]   And then a five second exhale, and then a five second hold.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.340]   And you just need to repeat that for the time domain.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.640]   I typically honestly don't use a timer.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.580]   You'll actually notice a lot of people will like fall asleep
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.660]   or get really close to falling asleep in this period.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.580]   You could do a triangle version of that
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:02.040]   where you do an inhale, hold, exhale,
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.460]   and then go right back into your inhale.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.620]   Or there's a bunch of different tricks you can try here.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:06.460]   You need to play around
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.300]   and see what actually works best for you.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.820]   10 minutes is probably better,
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.480]   but if you can just at least give me three, that'll work.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.380]   If you're really, really resistant,
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.020]   you can actually do that just in the shower.
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.620]   And so if you're going to finish your workout,
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.440]   get in the shower.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.700]   Again, just close your eyes in the shower,
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.940]   give me three minutes of focused relaxation breathing,
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.120]   and that will accelerate the recovery process.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.680]   I love it, and I particularly love it
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.840]   because my laboratory works on stress and respiration,
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.040]   okay, breathing, and the interactions between the two.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.860]   And I'll just mention a result
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.960]   that was just accepted for publication,
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.620]   so it should be out by time this episode airs.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.560]   Thank you.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.620]   This is the beautiful work of Not Me Directly,
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.640]   although it took place in my lab,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.220]   but as we know, it's the students at post-docs
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.700]   who really do the heavy lifting
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.440]   of Dr. Malise Balbon in my lab.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.700]   He's a phenomenal researcher that showed
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.480]   that a short period of five minutes of box breathing,
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.820]   of exactly the type that you described,
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.620]   or a cyclic sighing,
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.020]   so two inhales followed by an extended exhale
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.860]   to lungs empty.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.540]   Ideally, the inhales are done through the nose,
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.900]   the exhales are done through the mouth,
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.660]   although it could all be done through the nose,
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.900]   or the mouth for that matter,
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.420]   but probably nose, nose for inhale,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.960]   inhale, mouth for exhale,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.260]   or inhales through the nose,
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.780]   and exhale through the nose.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.300]   Cyclic sighing, as we refer to it, done for five minutes.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:34.020]   Both of those produce very significant decreases
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.180]   in resting heart rate.
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.020]   The overtime will increase things like heart rate variability
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.740]   and so on and so forth.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:44.620]   So provided that there are extended exhales,
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.180]   it seems like the calming response
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.600]   and the reduction in overall stress occurs.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.920]   The only thing that really sends things
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.120]   in the other direction would be something
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.540]   like cyclic hyperventilation.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.180]   I'm sure you've observed that.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.680]   And interestingly,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:02.780]   when we had people just do five minutes of meditation,
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.260]   during which of course they are breathing,
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.520]   but they're just allowing their breathing to progress,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.580]   however it happens to be in that moment,
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.500]   or moments across the five minutes,
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.040]   there were reductions in the same sorts of markers of stress
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.420]   that I described, but not as significant as breathing.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.100]   So I love the box breathing tool post-workout,
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.940]   and there's some other alternatives there too
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:25.820]   that I just mentioned.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:29.280]   But I think people greatly underestimate
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.660]   the potency of breathing
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:34.500]   for shifting one's nervous system function away from stress,
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.400]   or if one wants, toward more alertness and stress.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.540]   - I actually have a couple of questions for you on that.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.380]   - Sure.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:42.080]   - I think the audience would appreciate this.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.980]   How long were those boxes?
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.780]   Was it just user selected?
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.620]   - Great question.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.240]   So we used the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.080]   - Amazing.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.580]   - In order for people to determine
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.180]   how long the different sides of the box should be.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.920]   And you covered carbon dioxide tolerance test
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.280]   in a previous episode.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.460]   And we can provide a link to that clip
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.420]   in the show note captions.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.260]   But as you point out,
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.120]   it involves a long extended exhale to lungs empty.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.980]   And of course people could sit with lungs empty,
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.600]   but they have to accurately, faithfully, as we say,
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.480]   report how long it took them to empty their lungs.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.380]   We use that as a gauge.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.520]   Typically, if it takes, if people go to lungs empty
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.320]   in 20 seconds or less,
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.260]   I believe I have to go back to the paper and look,
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.020]   but I believe that the duration
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.220]   for each of the sides of the boxes, as it were,
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.800]   was somewhere between two and three seconds.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   If they had a CO2 discard time of anywhere from 20 seconds
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.240]   up to about 40, 45 seconds,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.440]   we use the sides of the box where I believe
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.640]   between four and six seconds.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.620]   And then for people longer than who could discard their air
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.900]   over a period of a minute or more,
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.740]   we used a box duration that is inhale hold,
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.800]   exhale hold duration of somewhere between,
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.680]   I believe it was seven or maybe it was eight
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.320]   and as long as 11 or 12 seconds.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.120]   'Cause you get your kind of free diver types
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.520]   who can really do this,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.120]   who are really well-trained for this sort of thing.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.040]   Don't quote me exactly on those numbers,
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.640]   but that was approximate.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.040]   - Those line up exactly with what we've done.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.600]   So I believe it's going to be close
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.280]   within seconds of non-important distinction.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.360]   It's going to be close enough.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.480]   So that's great.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.840]   And that was, it took them what, six weeks?
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.240]   - So this study was done over the period of a month
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.840]   and then when they were swapped into a new pattern
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.800]   of breathing condition or meditation condition.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.400]   And this was all done in the natural world, as we say.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.660]   They were wearing Woot bands,
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.480]   they were getting heart rate, heart rate variability,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.080]   sleep data, subjective data about mood, et cetera.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.500]   So there were a lot of measures,
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.040]   but this was more than a hundred subjects
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.640]   out in the wild of life.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.800]   And we tried as best we could to track life stress events
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.460]   and exercise and things like that.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.800]   That was harder to control outside the laboratory.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.440]   Really all those results speak to exactly
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.620]   what you're describing here,
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.520]   which is that deliberate respiration
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.260]   that involves controlled holds and exhales
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:09.760]   really has a dramatic and very immediate impact
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.400]   on reducing our levels of stress.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.240]   - That's wonderful.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.780]   I'm not surprised at all with your findings.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.420]   And what's really interesting about that is,
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.400]   you mentioned how the exhalation portion
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.160]   is primarily responsible for the down regulation.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.620]   And that's actually goes back
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.320]   to our previous endurance conversation,
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.000]   which is that in general at rest at non altitude,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.540]   increases in CO2 are the primary driver for ventilation.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.480]   And so what that generally means is inhales are associated
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.220]   with an uptick and sympathetic state
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.600]   and exhales are associated with a uptick
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.400]   of parasympathetic state.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.760]   This is generally why folks will do things like exhale
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.560]   and finish that exhale right before they perform
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.680]   a very high precision neurological task.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.660]   So if you're going to say, aim at a target and shoot,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.800]   you're going to exhale fully
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.920]   and then almost always execute that movement
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.060]   at the end of the exhale,
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.600]   because that's when you're in your highest
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.560]   parasympathetic state and lowest drive for ventilation.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.000]   I have to say, I'm not surprised at all
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.840]   that you guys found that.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.000]   There's actually other data that point to individuals,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.800]   particularly after endurance training,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.160]   that can get back down to baseline heart rate
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.040]   is going to be correlated with who gets
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.880]   the most actual result of their training.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.640]   So that if you take a bunch of individuals
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.480]   and put them through an endurance training program,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.880]   and if you measure how quickly they can get back down
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.380]   to baseline after each workout,
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.080]   in general, those folks that are better at that
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.640]   are going to see greater improvements in performance
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.720]   at the end of your, say, four or six
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.360]   or eight week training block.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.600]   And so there's a little bit of causation
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.120]   and correlation there that we have to untie,
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.800]   but I think it's enough to say,
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.440]   hey, if you invest these three,
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.580]   and in your case, your study was five minutes,
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.540]   it's only going to enhance recovery.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.280]   You have a likelihood of increasing
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.020]   your results from your training.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.980]   And now we also have additional benefits
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.960]   like being able to transition more appropriately
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.640]   into our next task, going to work,
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.180]   going to see family, whatever the thing is.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.060]   And it's a nice close to,
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.420]   I asked you to be in a high sympathetic state body,
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.020]   and I asked you to perform and to be under stress,
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.540]   I gave you recovery,
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.320]   and now we're ready to transition in our next thing
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.180]   so that we don't take that exercise energy, if you will,
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.820]   into our next task,
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.460]   which may or may not want me in a sympathetic drive state.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.020]   - So if somebody is sore following a workout,
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.660]   either locally sore in a muscle group or group of muscles,
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.700]   maybe in their legs or chest or torso,
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.480]   or maybe their whole body is sore,
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.120]   as it sometimes is the case,
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.080]   what are some tools that they can implement
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.460]   in order to accelerate the,
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.360]   I want to call it moving out of that soreness,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.300]   but it's really, as we know,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.440]   the alleviation of the soreness
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.080]   through a bunch of different processes.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.560]   What are the most effective tools
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.880]   to push back on that soreness and dissipate it?
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.400]   First of all, it's not lactate.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.500]   That's just a really important thing
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.060]   that we still hear people talk about is,
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.300]   you're sore 24 hours later,
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.980]   you got to do this thing to get the lactate out of there.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.420]   As we talked about in the metabolism conversation
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.620]   in an episode, that is not the cause of fatigue,
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.580]   and it's certainly not the cause of soreness.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.820]   So not an actionable tip there,
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.740]   but just a pet peeve of mine when I hear people say that,
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.280]   that I get irritated, so we can maybe end that conversation.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.040]   Strategies, tools.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.460]   Here's what you can do.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.320]   You can actually wear compression gear.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.260]   That will help a little bit.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.300]   There's a decent amount of evidence
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.280]   suggesting if you just were to put
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.760]   some tighter fitting clothes on,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.040]   leisure wear or compression gear if you have it,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.440]   that that can actually prevent
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.820]   a little bit of soreness from occurring.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.480]   So if you're in the case of poor Natasha
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.100]   and you realize you've just done way, way, way too much,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.540]   or you went and hung out with your bow hunting friend
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.400]   and you trained way too hard and you realize,
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.060]   oh my goodness, I'm going to be very sore here,
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.960]   you can immediately put on compression gear
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.760]   and weigh that really for as long as possible.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.420]   - What are some examples of compression gear?
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.820]   I've seen people on the plane with those high socks.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.340]   - Yeah, I mean, anything that you wear compression gear
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.300]   for what you do for exercise.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.580]   So whether these are just compression pants and leggings,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.460]   the tight fitting leggings,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.180]   whether this is a long sleeve shirt,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.180]   that's like a rash guard you would wear in jiu-jitsu
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.300]   or surfing or something like that.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.540]   As long as it's tight fitting,
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.480]   it doesn't have to be much more than that.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.260]   You can wear, I suppose you could get the socks,
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.860]   would be great, but we generally just tell our athletes
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.700]   they would put on a long sleeve compression shirts
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.940]   that they would wear for their training
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.380]   and then long compression leggings and that'd be fine.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.380]   - Can people apply these compression garb after training
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.660]   and still get some of the positive effects?
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.300]   - Yeah, I have not seen any evidence to suggest
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.780]   that that would block adaptation.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:01.940]   That may be the case.
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.020]   I am not aware of those studies if that happens,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.780]   but I certainly know that the information suggests
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.340]   it can enhance a little bit of muscle recovery.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.280]   - But ideally one knows if they are about to do a workout
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.620]   that could trigger a lot of soreness
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.280]   and then wears compression gear of some sort to offset that.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.880]   And if so, does it have to be local to the muscle groups
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.720]   that you're working on?
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.420]   The reason I asked about the socks is my understanding
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.260]   that the compression socks people wear on the plane
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.460]   is that it's going to shift the patterns of blood flow,
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.540]   not just in the lower legs, but all over the body.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.180]   - Yeah, you're probably gonna wanna focus it
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.900]   on the actual exercising tissue,
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.100]   though actually that's a really good question.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.020]   I don't know the answer of whether or not
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.280]   you did an upper body workout,
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.180]   only wore lower body compression gear
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.060]   if that would actually help.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:44.900]   That's a great question.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.740]   It may have been done, I don't know,
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.940]   but I don't know the answer to that.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.380]   In general, we just tell people we're the whole thing
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.160]   as much as you can.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.660]   I actually am not concerned that you're wearing it
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   during your workout.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.180]   It is something you could put on afterwards
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.500]   or even wear just a little bit of compression the other day.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.940]   We've actually did a really fun study.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.860]   I collaborated with Bill Kramer,
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:10.420]   whose Sports Scientist of the Year Award
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.140]   is the Bill Kramer Award,
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.380]   if that gives you an indication out of
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.380]   University of Connecticut, as well as with Lee Brown,
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.460]   so two lifetime achievement award winners.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.300]   And we put people on a plane in Storrs, Connecticut,
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.820]   and flew them to Cal State Fullerton,
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.660]   so a cross-country flight.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.300]   And some of them got to wear compression gear
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.060]   during the flight and others did not.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.140]   And then they landed in California,
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.280]   did a training bout, put them back on the plane,
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.780]   went back to Storrs, and I think they did
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.100]   another training bout when they got back there.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.900]   There was a lot of data that came out of that paper,
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.580]   but one of the things that was clear
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.700]   is the compression group was effective
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:47.600]   at handling some of the blood-related coagulation
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.180]   and other issues associated with long flights,
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.460]   and particularly athletic performance.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.860]   So that's actually a sneaky little insider trick
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.420]   that I'll use a lot with people,
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.980]   particularly with athletes that are traveling,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.000]   is just wear that compression gear on the plane.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.140]   So you talked about that and that sort of
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.240]   brung that study to mind as another effective strategy.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.900]   So compression gear in general,
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.460]   as well as particularly on a plane,
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.380]   basically the tighter you can get it, the better,
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.760]   without obviously making your hands purple
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.300]   and being uncomfortable and things like that.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.780]   So it doesn't have to be overly tight.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.180]   Anything will work and probably help.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.300]   So I'm also doing that personally
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.260]   anytime I'm taking a flight like that, as much as I can,
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.500]   just to feel a little better when I get there.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.580]   - So what are some other methods that we can use
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.740]   to alleviate acute soreness?
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.900]   - Well, if we continue down this same theme,
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.140]   which is saying, okay,
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.460]   we use some sort of pressure manipulation
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.380]   to enhance recovery.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.520]   If compression is one strategy,
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.100]   you can also use things like compression boots or garments,
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   and these are nomadic devices that will pump air outside you
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.420]   and compress back and forth.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.980]   There's any number of devices that will do this.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.300]   You can also use the physical hand.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.820]   So this would be massage and body work.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   They're all really working as best we can tell
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.220]   on the same mechanisms,
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.200]   which are effectively moving fluid in and out of the tissue,
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.380]   as well as potentially enhancing blood flow,
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.900]   increasing capitalization,
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.940]   and which is going to only get nutrients in
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.300]   and waste products out.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.100]   So you can kind of pick and choose
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.420]   based upon your budget, preferences, availability, timing,
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.260]   things like that.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.220]   So those are all effective strategies.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.860]   Outside of that really is the next largest category,
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.860]   which is now thermal.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.260]   And so far in this discussion,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.180]   we've mentioned cold water immersion.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.820]   And I talked about in the hypertrophy section,
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.100]   how you would not want to do that immediately post exercise,
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.220]   which would be getting into cold water or an ice bath,
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.140]   if you're trying to grow muscle mass.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.100]   Having said that there is good evidence
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:52.580]   showing that cold water immersion specifically
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.260]   is effective at reducing muscle soreness.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.400]   So it is a fair consideration.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.300]   And it's a classic example of how
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.460]   there are no free passes in physiology.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.420]   Nothing is always good or always bad.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.180]   It's always about what are you willing to give up
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.820]   and versus what you're willing to do get.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.540]   And the case of like cold water immersion,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.460]   you may be thinking, yeah,
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.900]   I might want some of the hypertrophic adaptations.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.580]   But if you're in that phase of training
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.020]   where you're actually trying to push more
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.660]   towards optimization in that moment,
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.620]   rather than long-term adaptation,
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:25.360]   then an ice bath might be a great choice.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.660]   In addition, if you fall into a scenario like Natasha did,
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.100]   and you realize like, I'm just so unbelievably sore,
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.420]   this might cost me three or four or five
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.300]   or six days of training.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.020]   It might be worth it for you to accelerate
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.780]   that recovery process by a couple of days
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.220]   so that you don't miss so much training.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.660]   So it's an algorithm, it's an equation.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.980]   What am I looking for?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.340]   Again, if I'm in season or trying to compete,
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.440]   or if I have just done way, way, way too much exercise,
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.740]   and I'm really in significant pain,
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.220]   you would probably be willing to give up
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.540]   some small percentage of eventual muscle growth
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.780]   after a single session to get out of pain.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.140]   So of the cold strategies,
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.060]   cold water immersion is clearly the best approach
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.600]   rather than cold air or some other tactics.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.980]   So a cold shower is probably not enough here.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:12.320]   You really do want to be either in moderately cold,
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.120]   this is maybe 40 to 50 degree water
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.020]   for probably north of 15 minutes,
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.720]   or you can be in sub 40 for as little as maybe five minutes
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.560]   to get some of the effect.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560]   And there's been a number of studies,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.740]   some sort of summarizing a bunch of that kind of into one
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.360]   rather than going through them point by point.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.900]   - The numbers you just threw out,
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.620]   which I'm assuming are Fahrenheit,
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.580]   seem really cold to me, uncomfortably cold.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.540]   - Absolutely.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.280]   Though I always recommend that people ease into it
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.700]   as a protocol overall,
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.020]   that they not immediately go to 35 degree cold water
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.100]   if they've never done it before.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.620]   That said, once people are comfortable being uncomfortable,
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.820]   because I always answer the question,
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.200]   how cold should it be exactly?
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.600]   Would you agree that it should be very, very cold,
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.020]   so much so that you really, really want to get out,
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.120]   but that you're able to stay in safely,
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.520]   whatever that value happens to be.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.100]   - You absolutely need to be safe.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.500]   Having said that, we have actually in our XPT retreats
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.160]   put dozens, if not hundreds of people at this point,
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.300]   immediately into the sub 35 degree water,
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.580]   their first time ever and done three minutes,
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.660]   multiple rounds in a session so they can handle it.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.880]   But you don't need to go that crazy if you don't want.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.020]   You kind of have to play a game, right?
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.260]   Do you want to be really, really cold
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.300]   for a short amount of time?
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.500]   Or do you want to be like kind of cold
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.940]   for a longer amount of time?
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.200]   Really the only mistake you can make
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.000]   is doing something like 65 degree water,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.560]   which for the most people is not very comfortable,
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.960]   and doing five or 10 minutes.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   - It's just not going to be effective.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.120]   - It's probably not going to be effective.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.440]   So if you're like, man, 35 is absolutely crazy,
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.060]   and you want to do 55 degree water,
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.960]   and there's literature in that area,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.260]   but it's going to say you need to probably be there
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.220]   somewhere almost surely north of 10 minutes.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.000]   And some of it will actually show you need to be in there
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.940]   like well north of 20 to 30 minutes.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.840]   So for my money, I would rather go really, really cold
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.780]   and get it done in five minutes,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:09.040]   but personal preference on this one.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.220]   You can also make it a little bit easier on yourself.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.960]   There is not nearly as much evidence,
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.320]   but there is some on contrast stuff.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.380]   So this is when you go cold, hot, sort of back and forth.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.120]   There are no really good rules
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.640]   in terms of how much should you go,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.840]   how many rounds, how long and cold, how long and hot.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.280]   Again, there have been a couple of studies,
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.480]   but obviously those studies use numbers,
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.980]   but that doesn't mean those have been tested
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.160]   to see what are optimal, which is a very big difference.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.180]   So you can really just kind of play that by feel.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.440]   Hot is good for recovery.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.500]   You just have to be careful
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.620]   because you are going to put more blood flow in the area.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.600]   And so you may walk out of there
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.160]   with some additional acute swelling,
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.900]   which is then going to put greater pressure on there.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.840]   So you have to kind of play with that.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.180]   I personally really like hot for recovery.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.280]   I will feel maybe not great in that moment,
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.920]   but the next day I tend to feel really, really good.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.760]   In addition, if I wake up the next morning
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.480]   and I'm really, really hurting and I'm super stiff,
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.680]   a hot bath will help that quite a bit.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.480]   So you can play with some of those protocols.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.520]   I can, you don't have to do ice.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.040]   There's absolutely no requirement to do so.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.000]   It is just an option if you're interested.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.960]   - The studies of Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.040]   - Sure, yeah.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.980]   - Are not directly aimed at alleviating soreness or recovery.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.080]   They're more about increasing thermal capacity
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.200]   by a storage of brown adipose tissue,
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.160]   not the blubbery fat,
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.120]   but the stuff around the clavicles and around the heart
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.600]   that help you generate body heat at rest
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.880]   and metabolism and so on.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.080]   And the numbers there that she's come up with,
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.480]   again, have not been tested
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.340]   against all the possible derivations.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.600]   Just like with breathing, we did five minute sessions,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.760]   but who knows, maybe a minute
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.160]   would have been equally effective.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.840]   We just, there are constraints on these sorts of studies.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.380]   But the values that she's come up with,
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.420]   which seem to be good thresholds for making sure
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.840]   that an adaptation response is triggered by heat and cold,
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.660]   is it ends up being 57 minutes per week total
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.040]   of uncomfortable but safe heat, in that case sauna.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.700]   And that can be all in one session
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.760]   or breaking it up into a couple of sessions
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.780]   on the same day or different days.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.400]   And then 11 minutes per week of cold,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.500]   either in one single session or multiple sessions.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.100]   Again, one could do more.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:28.800]   One could break that up over multiple days
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.480]   or do it all in one day or do it all in one,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.100]   an hour in the sauna and then 11 minutes
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.080]   in the cold or vice versa,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.560]   although that seems a little bit extreme,
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.200]   especially for the uninitiated.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.720]   But those are the numbers that have been studied.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.840]   But as you point out,
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.440]   there are not a lot of really thorough studies
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.800]   examining different cold protocols
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.760]   according to temperature by time requirements.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.780]   So there is a bit of subjective feel
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.020]   required to establish a routine.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.500]   - And I would actually say this is another time
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.100]   to reemphasize something we talked about
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.400]   at the beginning of our conversation,
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.780]   which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.940]   It's heavily influenced by your perception.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.100]   And so if you don't feel like they work for you,
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.940]   they won't work.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.200]   If you feel like they work fantastic, they do.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.360]   So it's a challenging field to get really objective data on.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.060]   So there's always going to be a little bit
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.360]   of subjective nature to some of these things.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.420]   I can tell you anecdotally,
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.400]   we've used hot and cold contrasts
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.540]   for a long time with athletes.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.700]   Some love it, some don't care for it
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.720]   and everything in between.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   So it's one of those things where I never mandated.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.460]   Of course, I can't mandate anything for anyone I work with,
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.520]   but I'm never like, hey, are you interested?
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.000]   Great, you're struggling in this area.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   Do you want to try this?
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.360]   You did and you liked it, great.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.080]   You're struggling in this area and you tried it,
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:42.920]   you didn't love it.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.560]   Okay, fine, I'm not.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.600]   We'll find other routes as we will get into.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.000]   There's a lot of ways to enhance recovery.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.880]   This is only one and it hasn't even really come down
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.440]   to stopping the problem in the first place.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.400]   We're just treating symptoms,
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.000]   which is first line of defense,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.360]   but you really need to go back and figure out
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.280]   why it's happening to begin with as a solution.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:08.640]   These are just different acute symptom management tactics.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.400]   - One final point about deliberate cold exposure
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.820]   I think worth mentioning is one of the reasons
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.440]   the shower is effective, but not nearly as effective
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.660]   as cold water immersion or immersion in ice up to the neck
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.200]   is simply because of the reason you stated before,
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.240]   which is that most showers are not going to get that cold.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.680]   You're not going to get down into the sub forties.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.460]   Also, cold showers haven't really been studied that much.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.440]   They have, but not nearly as much as immersion
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.020]   and people always ask why.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.920]   I just think about the challenges of studying
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.380]   cold water exposure in the shower
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.600]   where you can't really control
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.620]   for how much of the body is covered,
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.160]   whether or not the head stays under different sized bodies,
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.200]   et cetera, whereas when people come into a laboratory,
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.320]   they can get into a cold water.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.000]   We know where the neck is, we know where the chin is
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.360]   and we can make sure that people's arms
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.520]   and legs are underneath, but with cold shower,
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.060]   sure, you can make everyone face away or toward the shower,
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.100]   but it's really tricky.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:07.420]   And for all the variations that were described.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.680]   That said, would you agree that
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.640]   if one wants to use deliberate cold exposure,
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.660]   that cold shower is better than nothing
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.400]   and cold immersion in circulating cold water
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.000]   or ice bath is better than cold shower?
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.160]   - Yeah, what I would actually say,
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.120]   if you're looking for recovery from muscle soreness,
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.800]   I would say cold shower is probably doing very little
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.840]   because you're not going to be able to get enough cold water
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.360]   onto any muscle besides basically your head.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.600]   So maybe you could try a cold bath
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.780]   and so you at least get some surface area coverage.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.280]   But yeah, if you want to use cold shower
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.800]   for all the other awesome reasons to cold shower,
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.440]   that's totally great, but if you're trying to use that
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.640]   to recover your low back and glutes
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.680]   from being sore from training in a good way,
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.080]   it's probably not going to do much.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:53.960]   The immersion would be there.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.600]   You actually also hit a sneaky other point,
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   which is if you can't get your water super cold,
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.800]   just make the water move.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.320]   So if you have jets and stuff, you can turn on.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.040]   And anyone who's tried this and you're like,
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.820]   okay, I can do a 40 degree bath, awesome.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.700]   Try 60 when the water's moving.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.220]   - Right, because you break up the thermal layer.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.160]   Normally you have a little thin layer of water
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.000]   that you're heating up.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:13.840]   You break that up.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.660]   - It's a whole new world.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.120]   So being very still in the cold water
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.600]   is actually the weaker way to go.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.440]   - Correct.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.740]   - That you can make your face stoic,
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.940]   but make your body circulate some water around you.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.160]   As long as we're on this,
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.960]   maybe just one more point about heat.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.640]   I've certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry sauna,
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.800]   steamed sauna, excuse me.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.400]   Jacuzzis can work pretty well.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:40.160]   Males, if you are looking to conceive in the 60 days
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   following sauna or hot tub,
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.380]   do realize that both those approaches
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.320]   do severely limit the number of motile sperm substantially.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.920]   So for people that are not trying to conceive,
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.440]   don't think that this works reliably enough
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.640]   that you could use it as a form of contraception,
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.080]   but for people that are trying to conceive,
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.480]   it really is detrimental to sperm health, right?
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.680]   And so for that reason, some people will bring an ice pack
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.380]   and put it on the groin or near the groin when they go in,
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.760]   which is harder to do in a hot tub than a sauna.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.240]   So here we're getting into the fine points
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.260]   or crude points, if you will, pun intended.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:21.860]   But the idea is that we wouldn't want anyone
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.220]   to approach these techniques
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:25.180]   and compromise their other life goals inadvertently.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:28.020]   - I was not allowed anywhere near these things
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:30.260]   when we were at that stage of life.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:32.900]   I'll just say that Natasha put an X nay on me
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.820]   hanging out with Laird, so.
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.180]   - Going in the sauna?
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.020]   - For those reasons, she's like,
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.560]   "You're not going in, you're not going, none of the stuff."
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.400]   And I just had to wait.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:42.540]   - Right, heat and sperm have a relationship,
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.680]   but it's not one that's positive for the sperm.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.100]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.680]   to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.000]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.660]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.260]   to help you better understand your body
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.120]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.620]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.020]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.860]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.980]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.180]   from a quality blood test.
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.540]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.940]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.140]   is that you get information back about various levels
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.140]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.700]   InsideTracker makes knowing what to do
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.300]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.040]   They have a personalized platform that lets you see
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.820]   what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.240]   but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts,
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.740]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.840]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.580]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.100]   that are optimal for you.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.460]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:40.120]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.660]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:47.260]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:52.000]   Are there ways to combine the various types of stimuli
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.300]   that you described for inducing recovery?
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.940]   You talked about breathing-based tools,
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:01.420]   which while they could adjust and indeed do adjust oxygen
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.420]   and carbon dioxide ratios and et cetera,
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.780]   I'm guessing the major effect of those on recovery
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.680]   is going to be neural.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.420]   It's going to be deliberate calming of the nervous system,
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.660]   more sympathetic-based, as you mentioned.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:14.580]   - Yeah, most definitely.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.900]   - And then you talked about some movement-based
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.940]   and touch-based approaches,
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:22.580]   which will, movement certainly will circulate blood,
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.740]   but also will generate contractions of the muscles,
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.340]   which may be if indeed, again, it's still speculation,
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.340]   if indeed some of the soreness is due to excessive stretch
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.580]   or swelling at the stretch ends of the muscles,
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.600]   that would make sense.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.460]   So movement and touch, and then thermal.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:42.020]   Are there ways to combine these that are more effective
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.480]   or maybe even synergistic?
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.280]   - Yeah, I suppose you could throw on
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.820]   some compression garment,
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.040]   put on a pneumatic compression device and sit in the sauna
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.960]   while you down-regulate your breath.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.260]   Like that would be fine.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:57.700]   Quite honestly though, you probably don't need
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.120]   to maximize all of them.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.360]   We were joking, you could probably go for a light swim
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.200]   while regulating your breathing in cold water.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.860]   You'd get the compression from the cold water
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.260]   and you'd be in a good spot.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.740]   So you can certainly do that.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.580]   The reality of it is,
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:15.060]   I generally look for some physical approach
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.820]   and then some holistic approach
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.380]   of the breath work, basically.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.820]   So I want breath and then something else.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.200]   If you knock those two things out, you're in a good spot.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.160]   So that could be breath while you're in thermal stress.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.620]   So just controlling and doing the on-regulation stuff.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.800]   You have to also remember ice is a stressor.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.680]   And I'll actually show you some data here in a second
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.680]   about how that actually can enhance systemic recovery.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.580]   Although it won't happen in the acute minutes.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.880]   In fact, it's gonna take at least 30 to 60 minutes
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.200]   and then you'll eventually see a rebound effect.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.920]   But acutely, it's going to make you actually
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.640]   more sympathetic, which is going the other direction.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.240]   Heat can do the opposite or it can actually drive you up.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.500]   So it's a little bit dependent upon how you respond,
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.900]   what time of day and how you're using.
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.780]   So in general, I guess combining them is,
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:09.040]   if you need it, depending on what you have,
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.080]   what's available, so perhaps you don't have a sauna,
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.600]   but you can take a hot bath, great.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.360]   Maybe you have some percussion device, some tool,
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.120]   and you can use that, but you don't have a sauna, amazing.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.280]   Don't have ice bath, these things.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.680]   So I think rather than thinking
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.360]   about an optimal combination of them,
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.440]   I would say just use a couple of the tactics
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.440]   based on what you have and what is easily available
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.460]   in your situation.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.260]   - I'd love for you to teach us about some of the methods
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:39.240]   for longer form recovery as it relates
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.560]   to overreaching and overtraining.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.500]   - Sure, you wanna think about this in a couple of phases.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.340]   Phase one is to try to prevent it
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.620]   from happening in the first place.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.000]   In terms of training load, you're gonna just go back
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.940]   to our previous episodes where we talk,
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.900]   give you specific instructions for how much
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.940]   to increase your volume and intensity per week, et cetera.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.300]   The other thing you can do then is do some monitoring,
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:02.560]   and I'll go over some different tools, some cost-free ones,
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.260]   as well as some higher technologically demanding ones
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.820]   to monitor to see if it's actually happening.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.540]   And then the third approach here is,
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.260]   what if this has already occurred?
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.620]   I figured out, how do I get back out of that hole?
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.520]   So I would like to just sort of tackle these one by one
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.520]   in order and talk about what's happening,
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.600]   what tools you can use, and why they're going to work.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.980]   All right, so anytime we're talking
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:28.780]   about fatigue management here, most people are aware
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:31.700]   of these terms, because if you have any sort of technology,
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.220]   you're probably getting some sort of readiness score,
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:38.220]   or recovery score, or strain, depending on which app,
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.620]   or watch, or tech you have,
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.160]   you have a little bit of vernacular change.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.220]   If you're in the sport performance world,
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:46.780]   you might be looking at things, again, like load,
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:48.700]   or a GPS tracking and monitoring,
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.120]   and really all of it is doing the same thing.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.040]   It's trying to either, one, predict a problem
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.620]   is going to happen in the future,
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.820]   and then placing restrictions upon you
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.200]   so that you don't run into that situation.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.680]   The other thing it's possibly doing
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   is identifying a drop in physiology or performance,
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.920]   and then saying, we need to get you out of this hole.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.340]   That's really what's happening.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.100]   And so when we think of the first one,
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:20.020]   just imagine a scenario like a mileage limitation,
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.500]   pitch count in baseball, and what has happened there
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.340]   is individuals in those fields have looked and said,
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.600]   hey, what we notice is people who throw, say,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.020]   more than 100 pitches in a game
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.040]   tend to start losing effectiveness and increase injury rate.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.400]   Therefore, we're predicting the next time you go to play,
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.060]   if you cross that threshold,
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.600]   we start having an increased risk of negative consequences.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.520]   So therefore, we're going to cap your, in this case,
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.120]   pitching volume at that 100 pitches per game,
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:48.960]   or whatever the case.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.020]   Same thing with running, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.120]   So you could just simply do that.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.640]   And there's actually really cool data coming out now
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.680]   on sport performance stuff,
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.720]   looking at things like IMUs and GPS trackers,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.880]   and trying to identify even position
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.760]   by position specific recommendations
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.780]   for how much distance you should cover in a practice,
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.520]   in a training session, so that you can say,
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.200]   hey, these positions don't cross this threshold,
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.400]   these positions don't cross this threshold,
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.600]   in basketball, in tennis, and all kinds of things like that.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.480]   That's not probably extremely applicable
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.080]   to many of the listeners right now,
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.760]   but it is still conveying the idea that
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.240]   if we understand where we break,
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.800]   then we can stop ourselves
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.900]   from getting there in the first place.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:34.040]   The functional example here is just thinking
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.440]   about basic things like where do I start my training program,
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.000]   and then how do I progress it.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.280]   And we've already covered those numbers.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.840]   In either case, though, you want to have three markers
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.820]   that you're paying attention to.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.320]   If you're concerned you're getting into an overreaching phase
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.300]   or potentially going to lead to overtraining,
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.360]   or you want to get out, it's three unique things.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.460]   Number one, we're going to look
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:57.140]   for some sort of performance metric, right?
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.720]   So this could be your times are going down,
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.840]   your squat numbers, your power is going down,
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.680]   any of these things.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.800]   So it's got to be an actual performance.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.000]   Number two, some sort of physiology.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.560]   And so I want to see something happening
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   with resting heart rate, some biomarker is moving,
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   heart rate variability, some other measure
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.000]   that is not influenced by you.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.520]   And the beauty of using biological markers are,
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.980]   if we contrast that to like performance,
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:29.800]   and I said, okay, here's our performance test.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.440]   Every day you come in, you're going to do a vertical jump.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.380]   And if one day you come in,
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.680]   all of a sudden your vertical jump is super low,
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.940]   I might think, oh man, maybe we're starting to overreach.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.000]   You also could be feeling lazy that day
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.580]   and just not have jumped very high on purpose
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.240]   because you didn't want to work out.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.240]   The beauty of biomarkers are,
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.980]   you don't get to manipulate them like that.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:50.200]   They don't care.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.460]   There's a downside to it,
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.320]   which is maybe they're just indirect markers, right?
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   And so I'm not telling you biological markers
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.420]   are better than performance markers.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.440]   What I'm saying is you want to look at both, all right?
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.860]   In fact, you want to look at our third category as well,
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.200]   which is some sort of symptomology.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.340]   And so am I having a symptom of overreaching?
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.020]   Am I seeing a performance decrement?
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.360]   And then am I seeing a biological marker as well?
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.280]   If you see all three of these popping up,
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.960]   you have reason to believe
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.800]   you've reached some overreaching.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.640]   Now, what you have not identified yet
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.500]   is if that is functional overreaching,
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.360]   non-functional overreaching, or true overtraining.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.700]   And remember, you shouldn't be feeling great
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.920]   after every training session.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.000]   You're trying to cause adaptation.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.340]   And until you back off, maybe even weeks or months later,
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.360]   to actualize the adaptation
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:45.040]   and get that super compensation and performance increase,
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.580]   you're going to have to invest a little bit.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:48.200]   So you're going to go in the hole.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.980]   Any sport performance coach
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.700]   is going to look at numbers throughout the year and say,
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.260]   "Yeah, yeah, when we first start training
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.860]   "in preparation for the season,
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.200]   "we are going to see a drop in performance
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.400]   "that day, that week."
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.880]   That's part of the plan though, right?
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.840]   That's the stress you're trying to accumulate.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.360]   So you want to see all three of those markers.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.240]   You just want to pay attention to a couple of things.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.440]   How long are they down for?
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:13.000]   A day, three days, seven days, 15 days, et cetera.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.820]   If you're seeing a performance drop in a day,
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.360]   and I am far away from performance,
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.200]   so the day that I want to peak for,
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.040]   I'm not going to do anything different.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.400]   If I see two days in a row, drop performance.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.320]   I'm not worried.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.520]   If I see more than probably, in my opinion,
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.840]   five days in a row of decrement,
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.720]   then I might start paying attention.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.520]   If you're in season though, or close to competition,
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.800]   or whatever that thing means to you,
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.240]   and you see more than a couple of days in a row of dropping,
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.500]   then you might actually want to take some steps
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:48.340]   to mitigate that.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:50.800]   So it really is important you understand,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.200]   again, what are we trying to do?
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.680]   Are we trying to cause adaptation,
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.900]   or are we trying to cause adaptation?
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:58.540]   And I have a very specific example of all this
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.560]   we can run through here in a second.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.120]   And then, of course, a bunch of tools
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.560]   to pull you out of those phases.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.200]   But that's fundamentally what we're trying to do here.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.660]   I would encourage you, again,
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.160]   don't be too reactive and responsive to any one measure.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.720]   I'm going to cover a whole bunch of them in a second.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.060]   But you can get lost in different things
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.740]   because they all have pros and cons.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:24.280]   And so I know it's simple to just look at one score
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.640]   on your watch and make your decisions because of that,
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.580]   or check your app.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:29.760]   But you really want to be careful of doing that.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.580]   You're going to probably lead yourself
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.780]   in the wrong direction more often
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.160]   than you're going to help yourself.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.500]   I'm curious as to why when we overreach too much,
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.320]   or too often, or we are overtraining,
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.880]   that performance is diminished.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.840]   Because on the face of it, it's kind of obvious.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.720]   You're overreaching, you're overtraining,
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.340]   so performance is diminished.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.120]   But that's completely circular.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.320]   You hear about things like adrenal fatigue
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.640]   and adrenal burnout.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.000]   Well, it turns out adrenal burnout
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.980]   doesn't even really exist.
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.820]   - Absolutely not.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.080]   - I mean, there is such a thing
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.620]   as adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:02.460]   - Of course.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:06.260]   - Phrases like burnout, adrenal burnout, overtraining,
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:11.160]   they're thrown around as much as words like gaslighting
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.820]   and obsessive compulsive are
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.440]   without any real clinical definition,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.740]   or there are clinical definitions,
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:19.660]   but people aren't obeying them when they use the language.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.580]   I do want to acknowledge, however,
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.980]   what is absolutely true,
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.100]   which is that overreaching too much, too often,
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:29.860]   overtraining, these can degrade performance.
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.640]   But mechanistically speaking, what's going on?
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.240]   Because I think once we understand
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.840]   what's going on mechanistically,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.800]   then I think we can all look at tools,
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.460]   whether or not it's breathing, movement, compression,
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:46.720]   thermal, psychological, motivational, et cetera,
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.080]   and have a much clearer sense
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.720]   as to what's going to work best
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.800]   and what likely won't work.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.220]   - I love this question so much
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.240]   because, as I mentioned at the beginning,
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.180]   I was fortunate to spend some of my graduate work
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:02.340]   in Andy Fry's lab at the University of Memphis,
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.260]   and we did a lot in this area.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:09.180]   In fact, this is how I learned how to do assays
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.180]   and run Western blots and measure signaling proteins
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.180]   and things like this,
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.660]   so this stuff is near and dear to my heart.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:19.340]   We also did a bunch of really wild studies,
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:21.060]   and he had done some before I got there,
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.580]   so I'm going to combine Andy Fry's entire career
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.520]   and just highlight some of the big pictures
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.660]   of what he found there.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:32.240]   He was very interested in exercise,
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.080]   particularly strength training,
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.620]   and trying to figure out this entire question,
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.380]   which is why is this actually happening
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:40.140]   when I work out too much, when I lift too much,
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.460]   that all of a sudden I can't sleep?
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.300]   What's happening?
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.300]   Why is my energy down?
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:49.200]   Why is my mood, my motivation reduced if I squat too much?
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.420]   So we did a whole series of studies across his career,
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:55.260]   and again, I'll just highlight some of the themes
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.820]   that ran through them.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.980]   So the first one that jumps out to mind
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:59.060]   that's early in his career,
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:01.120]   he did this really awesome protocol
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.280]   where he had people squat 100% of their back squat max
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.240]   every day for two weeks.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.600]   So you come into the gym,
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.880]   and I think this first one was on a machine,
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.520]   and you did a one-rep max,
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.700]   and then you came back in every single day for two weeks.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.640]   So these are what we would generally call
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   kind of like that short to moderate range overreaching,
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.520]   and by definition, some of them end up
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.040]   actually being true over training
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.020]   because it would take the individuals
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.380]   sometimes two to up to eight weeks
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.020]   to return back to their one-rep max
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.860]   at the end of these protocols.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.120]   So some of them were non-functional overreaching
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.120]   or some combination of that.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.460]   Well, along with that, he took a lot of blood samples
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.880]   as well as muscle biopsies
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:44.420]   to try to look at what's happening endocrinologically,
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:48.120]   neurologically, muscle physiology-wise
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:48.980]   to pay attention to what's happened.
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:50.780]   So a couple of things that jump out there.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.660]   One of his initial studies actually,
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.400]   I think the very first one he did
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.620]   when they ran that first squat every day protocol,
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.220]   what they found is catecholamine levels
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.840]   changed quite significantly.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.600]   And depending on kind of what you wanted
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.440]   to pay attention to there,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.600]   whether it was epinephrine or norepinephrine
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.160]   or even some other markers,
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.000]   they basically increased by somewhere
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.680]   between two to three fold.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.720]   And so a little bit of understanding of sleep physiology,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.280]   if adrenaline is extremely high epinephrine,
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.640]   you're gonna have a hard time sleeping.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.780]   So that alone was first indication.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.080]   This is like, wait a minute,
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.400]   something's actually happening here
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.140]   that's just beyond muscle soreness.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.000]   There's some sort of systemic fatigue happening.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.840]   And as you rightfully pointed out,
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.520]   is not the adrenal glands becoming fatigued.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.640]   That's sort of a bit of tongue and cheek pedantics.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.680]   It is cortisol dysregulation and general stress syndrome,
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.820]   but it's really can be noted in blood
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.080]   in terms of epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.960]   Another study he had done of a similar realm
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.800]   was over the course of seven and a half days,
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.360]   people came in and did 15 training sessions.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.200]   So it was really cool.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.240]   These are these really short bouts
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.840]   of just ridiculous training.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.200]   And they said, okay, like something's happening
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.080]   with epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.120]   Something's happening with testosterone.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.800]   What's it look like inside the cell?
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.460]   So now muscle biopsies came on board.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.000]   And they started looking at things like MAP kinases,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.240]   which are these signaling proteins
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.780]   that tend to be associated with an anabolic response.
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.440]   They upregulate muscle protein synthesis
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.920]   and they do many other things,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.880]   but that's like a big factor of them.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.040]   They looked at various androgens
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.360]   and glucocorticoid receptors,
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.520]   and they wanted to see like, well, maybe receptor density
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.840]   or and/or sensitivity is changing.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.800]   And in fact, surprise, surprise,
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.960]   that's exactly what they found.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.120]   So they found both androgen
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.440]   and glucocorticoid receptor concentrations were reduced.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.320]   And so you can start to see a picture forming,
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.800]   which is like, hmm, very similar
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.040]   to the insulin type two diabetes story,
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.060]   where you've really put yourself
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.180]   in a very high stress situation.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:58.400]   So presumably epinephrine, et cetera,
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.260]   testosterone releases are extremely high.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.340]   In response to that,
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.840]   to try to reach back to some level of homeostasis,
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.980]   you start downregulating the receptors for them.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.020]   And so it's like the signal can only get so high.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.820]   If you're gonna keep that gas on,
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:14.260]   we're gonna pull back the throttle and the receptors
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.220]   so that the total signal stays the same,
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.200]   if that makes a little bit of sense.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.240]   Well, that becomes obviously problematic.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.140]   So then like a final follow-up study here
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:25.980]   that is important to note is they did another protocol,
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:27.060]   which was really, really cool,
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.700]   and they said the first ones weren't enough.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:29.620]   So how about this?
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:31.860]   We're gonna come in every day for two weeks,
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:36.860]   and we're going to do 10 sets of a one rep max every day.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.760]   So they were coming in,
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.480]   and they would do 10 one rep maxes every day for two weeks.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.800]   And what's really cool about that study,
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.260]   if they didn't complete any of the repetitions,
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:51.380]   they had to repeat it until they had 10 successful
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:53.320]   one rep maxes on that given day.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.380]   Absolutely brutal, brutal protocol.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.400]   I wasn't there at the time.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.220]   They had finished that right before I got on campus,
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:01.440]   but I was actually able to be around
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.920]   when they were doing some of the final analysis
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.500]   there of the tissue.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.340]   What they wanna look at in this particular study
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:07.860]   was beta adrenergic receptors,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.320]   which are those receptors that are gonna be,
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.900]   epinephrine and such are gonna be binding for.
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:14.440]   So again, similar story here.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.940]   Perhaps are we losing overall sensitivity
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:20.180]   because of this extreme sympathetic stimulation?
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.320]   Now actually thinking back,
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.160]   what would have been pretty cool
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.740]   is if they had another group that did it,
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.900]   and did some down regulation breathing post
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.700]   to see if that can ameliorate some of the problems.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.980]   But of course this was 20 plus years ago
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.840]   or something like that.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.840]   So a couple of things that happened is the one rep maxes
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:40.240]   dropped by I think around like eight kilos
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.820]   by the end of the two weeks.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.220]   If I remember right, like the group average
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:45.560]   was something in the neighborhood of 151 kilos.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.720]   So these were pretty well-trained individuals.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.360]   And it went from, rather I think actually
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.600]   it was about 160 kilos and they dropped to like 152 kilos.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.720]   Something close to that.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.140]   What was more significant though
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.500]   was their power dropped by 35%,
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.780]   which is really, really interesting
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:06.020]   because if you pay attention to
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:09.960]   declines in physical performance over time,
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.000]   and I mean that like through aging,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.420]   what you'll see is people can hold on
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:15.040]   to muscle mass pretty well.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.720]   It will go down by about 1% or so after the age of 40.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.920]   However, strength will go down at like two to 4%
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.700]   and then power by eight to 10%.
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.320]   And if you look at actually world records
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.460]   across strength sports by age,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:34.080]   you'll see that they will decline by age, but not that much.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.340]   However, if you look at speed sports by age,
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.480]   they fall off the planet.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.160]   So it's very challenging to preserve fast through time,
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.880]   whether this is fatigue or because of age.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.640]   That's really important because that'll then tell you,
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.600]   hey, a little bit of a canary in the coal mine
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.920]   is not necessarily your strength, but your speed.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.300]   And so a lot of different techniques that we use
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:04.320]   to measure performance, remember that's our triad, right?
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.400]   Symptomology, physiology, and performance.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.760]   You're generally better looking
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.160]   at speed-based performance tests
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.400]   rather than strength-based performance tests
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:16.000]   to get an earlier indication of potential
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.120]   overreaching or overtraining.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.260]   So anyways, back to the individual study there.
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.040]   In that same group, again, we have the same problem
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.800]   where it took some of them two to eight weeks to come back.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.880]   So what they had to do is,
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.060]   I can't remember the exact timeframe.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.340]   I probably should have thought through this,
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:33.800]   but they had to come back something like every week
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.080]   or every couple of days, even after the study finished,
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.960]   until they got back to their baseline one rep max.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.500]   And some of them, it took them up to eight weeks
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.580]   before they finally got back.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:46.060]   So they probably were in a classic overtraining state
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.160]   at that point, which was done in as little as two weeks.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.000]   And this is also another point that people always ask,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.820]   like how long does it take?
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.100]   Is this something that has to happen
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:58.200]   over the course of months?
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.880]   Or like if I were to go do two days
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.040]   or this intense training camp for two or three weeks,
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.100]   could I actually cause overtraining?
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.720]   And the answer is if it is actually truly enough volume
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.560]   and enough intensity,
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.920]   you probably can do some significant damage
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.800]   in as little as two weeks.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.100]   Probably doesn't happen that often.
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:16.840]   Most likely you're probably going to be reaching a state
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.580]   of non-functional overreaching,
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.100]   but you may actually be able to put yourself in a position
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:24.480]   where it might take three or four weeks or more
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.920]   to get back to baseline after a truly intense.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.280]   And again, think about this protocol.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.340]   It's like totally unrealistic for the most part.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.540]   10 sets of one of a one rep max squat
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.400]   every day for two straight weeks.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.840]   Some folks, if you're extremely highly trained weightlifter,
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.420]   you might do something like that
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.440]   when you're very close to say world championships.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.160]   But outside of that really specific scenario,
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.520]   it's a totally absurd training protocol.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.600]   But that was the point, right?
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   We were trying to ensure that overtraining was met or close.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.920]   It's similar to when we've done,
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.240]   we've actually done I think three studies
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.880]   in the center for support performance
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.700]   on Dom's muscle soreness.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.680]   And in all those cases,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.100]   you do just like ridiculous leg extension protocols
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.260]   'cause you're just trying to ensure you cause suprasornis.
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:13.700]   If you don't, then you have nothing to study.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:17.460]   So absurd training protocols, but that's the point.
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.880]   So nonetheless, as a result, sure enough,
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.920]   the beta adrenergic receptors were down-regulated
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.000]   by something like 37%.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.860]   What's probably even more significant though
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:31.600]   was the sensitivity in those receptors was reduced
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.320]   by like two and a half fold.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.800]   And so it's like, okay, wait a minute.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.880]   We're becoming desensitized to this stimuli
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.220]   and we're also actually now starting
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.140]   to reduce our total concentration.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.960]   Similar, which is actually an interesting,
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.760]   it was a very sneaky smart thing to do
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.560]   is they looked at nocturnal urinary epinephrine
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.400]   and guess what?
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.840]   That was also up by like 50%.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.120]   - 15, one, five?
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.960]   - Five, zero.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:53.880]   - Five, zero.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.720]   - Yeah.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:57.480]   And so now you're seeing this tie-in where it's like,
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.880]   hmm, I'm seeing a response at the tissue level.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.680]   I'm seeing a response probably,
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.220]   although they didn't actually look at a pituitary
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.060]   or anything like that.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:10.740]   I'm seeing adrenal and other endocrinological problems.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.400]   And then I'm also seeing this increase in concentration
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.800]   of epinephrine when I'm supposed to be sleeping
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:20.060]   and surprise, surprise, I'm having a hard time sleeping.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:20.900]   Symptomology.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.220]   - But that's a very interesting finding
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:25.280]   about nocturnal epinephrine.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.120]   Epinephrine of course is adrenaline, it's released
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.520]   from the adrenals, no surprise there,
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.160]   but also from this brain area called locus coeruleus
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.000]   in the brain.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.500]   And the brain tends to be called epinephrine in the body,
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.100]   adrenaline, just to complicate everyone's understanding.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.240]   But that nomenclature did not come from us,
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.860]   so don't blame us.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:46.160]   The point is that rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.640]   so-called REM sleep is more abundant
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.060]   in the second half of the night.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.920]   We know that the dreams associated
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.240]   with rapid eye movement sleep are more emotionally laden
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.060]   and that those dreams and those emotional states
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:04.960]   are actually important for discarding the emotional load
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.040]   of previous day's experiences.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:11.000]   It acts as sort of a natural trauma therapy, if you will,
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.280]   because in the normal healthy state,
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.460]   those dreams are associated with an inability
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.800]   to release epinephrine at night.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.440]   So for me, what you just described,
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.160]   first of all, it's the first time I've ever heard of it,
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.280]   but it ties together something really quite clear
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.200]   from the sleep neuroscience literature,
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.880]   which is that when people are stressed,
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:36.240]   they tend to get less rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.680]   That rapid eye movement sleep normally is associated
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.960]   with low levels of epinephrine,
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.700]   so whether or not it's causal or not isn't clear,
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:47.000]   but sort of doesn't matter for sake of this discussion.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.360]   But what I'm wondering, and I suppose one could test for
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.000]   but may be observed, is whether or not people
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.400]   who are overtraining too much, overreaching too much,
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.560]   because of this elevated nocturnal epinephrine
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.120]   diminished REM sleep, whether or not their emotional state
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.260]   is also disrupted, because one thing we know for sure
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.640]   is if you want to disrupt somebody's emotional state,
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.120]   you deprive them of sleep
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.960]   and rapid eye movement sleep in particular.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.400]   The one caveat to that is, for those of you out there
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.960]   that have heard that rapid eye movement sleep deprivation,
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.600]   deliberate rapid eye movement sleep deprivation
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.920]   is a treatment for depression, that is true,
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.480]   but it's coupled with a next night
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.300]   enhanced rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.280]   So one of the major takeaways from all of this
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.000]   that I'm realizing is that, no surprise,
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.720]   daytime activities impact nighttime endocrine function,
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.660]   impact quality of sleep, impact daytime activities.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.760]   - Yeah, actually, there's so many fun things
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.360]   I want to do here now.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.800]   This is actually why measuring eye movement
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.960]   is a very fantastic tool for understanding total stress load
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.200]   and you can actually differentiate
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.360]   different types of stress, so caffeine use
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.220]   versus alcohol use versus sleep deprivation,
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.320]   by actually measuring eye movements.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.140]   That's actually what we do
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.840]   in our absolute rest sleep company,
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.960]   is in addition to getting a full PSD sleep study done
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.120]   in your bedroom, you're going to get
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.440]   an eye tracking assessment,
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.480]   which we're going to be able to figure out
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.520]   why you're getting there.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:15.960]   So nonetheless, yeah, if you actually look
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.120]   at the classic signs and symptoms of overtraining
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:23.000]   or overtraining syndrome, it's going to be everything
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.240]   from performance decrements, like we talked about,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.800]   resting heart rate is going to increase,
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.800]   you're going to see things like HRV drop
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.380]   by generally 20 or so percent,
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.480]   that would be a very large disruption in HRV,
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.520]   decreased body weight, and then all the stuff
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.760]   Andrew Yu just talked about.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:44.400]   So motivation, adherence, appetite, mood,
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:48.400]   all of this stuff are classically known associations
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.360]   with overtraining and that's for the exact reasons
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.720]   you're talking about, sleep disturbances and disruptions,
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.220]   wanting to train, motivation, all of this stuff
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.900]   goes part and parcel with non-functional overreaching
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.560]   and/or overtraining.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.360]   You can actually tie this back in a little bit more
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.520]   to some other biomarkers and this is great
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.320]   because this is the stuff we look for,
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.360]   this is the physiology stuff we look for.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.400]   You've probably talked about SHBG before,
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.080]   which is a sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.040]   so it's this protein that'll float in your body
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.760]   that's going to bind up sex hormones,
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.800]   in particular testosterone.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.900]   So what happens with overtraining is you can actually
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:28.160]   take this serially, like week by week,
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.680]   and you can actually see this number rise.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.080]   And so if you see this, like say you're using
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   a service like InsideTracker and you're getting
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.200]   your blood measured every so often and you see this number
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.440]   start ticking up, this is actually associated with that
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.000]   because what's actually happening is it's binding up
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.600]   all your free testosterone, and that's just leading back
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:47.800]   to the circle we're talking about.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:49.100]   And you can actually see the same thing happen
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.120]   with calorie restriction, just not enough calories.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.760]   But in this particular case, because it actually happens
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.880]   in both scenarios, you know it's not an issue
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.600]   simply of being under-calorie'd, it's clearly an issue
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.600]   of the training load being too high.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:04.960]   So just to give you another little tool,
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.040]   I can get the link for it, but there's a website
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:12.480]   that was created by, I forget which journal I'm slipping,
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.320]   but I'll get it to you, you can link it up,
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:18.520]   where you can actually go in and plug in a number of values
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:21.240]   from blood chemistry, so if you got your blood work done,
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.520]   and you can plug in your pre-number and your post-number.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.320]   So say you got it done, and then maybe 10 weeks later,
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.880]   you got it done again, and you're wondering,
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.480]   and you notice, hey, my free testosterone's down,
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:35.540]   or my SHBG is up, is it actually a meaningful number?
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.420]   And it will actually tell you whether or not the change,
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:41.580]   pre to post, is physiologically meaningful or not,
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:44.640]   or just within the error margin of the measure.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.900]   And you can actually change, like right there on the website
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:48.100]   you can change your confidence interval.
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.180]   So it's really, really cool if you just have your own blood
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:54.300]   and you wanna know like, hey, I had any level this year,
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.880]   and now it's here over there, it's just a totally free
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.300]   resource created, gone through peer review, all that stuff,
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.240]   and I'll give you the link to that.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.100]   So that's a pretty cool measure.
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.580]   In addition to that, like probably one of the more powerful
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:09.460]   and easy metrics, biologically,
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.960]   is to take your cortisol and DHEA ratio.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.660]   So this is known to be associated with a lot of things.
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:15.680]   You wanna be really careful.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.080]   You don't want this number to be too high or too low.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.620]   Something like 0.09 is about the right--
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.800]   - And it's cortisol to DHEA.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.140]   - DHEA to cortisol ratio, yeah.
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.660]   - DHEA to cortisol.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.660]   I'd love to tell you I said it backwards on purpose
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:31.000]   just to make sure everyone understood,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.260]   but I got it backwards.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:36.000]   - Yeah, I mean, this ratio has been associated
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.220]   with so many things.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.560]   You do have to be careful with association,
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.520]   not being causation, but everything from risk of infections,
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.320]   to metabolic health, and like other disease states,
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.800]   as well as more of what we're talking about,
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.600]   which is, hey, am I getting sort of cortisol dysregulation,
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.920]   which is what a lot of folks would call,
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.120]   you know, again, adrenal fatigue.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:57.380]   I know that's not really what's happening,
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:02.380]   but if adrenaline and epinephrine are off and testosterone,
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.520]   cortisol is gonna be along the right.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.840]   And so you can also look at things
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.240]   like testosterone to cortisol ratios.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.560]   So there's a lot of things you can glean here
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.820]   to give you some insights into where you're going.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.560]   If that ratio is too high,
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.980]   that's gonna be associated with metabolic syndrome
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:19.820]   and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.240]   If it's too low, that's gonna be associated
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.260]   with a lot of cognitive problems like aggression and mood
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:27.540]   and a bunch of things like that.
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.640]   So again, you wanna keep it right around that 0.09 ratio.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.880]   And most of the time, actually,
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.820]   in some blood chemistry stuff,
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:35.540]   you'll get a report of that,
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:37.480]   or you can calculate it pretty quickly.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.520]   - I'm sure we'll get into this in the episode
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.740]   that comes next on nutrition and supplementation.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.580]   - Totally.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:48.680]   - What about compounds that lower cortisol,
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.040]   such as ashwagandha?
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:53.760]   I can see now, based on the logic you're spelling out,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.220]   that during phases of a lot of intense overreaching
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.720]   or frequent overreaching,
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:05.580]   given that those compounds can indeed lower cortisol,
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:08.080]   rhodolia, rosacea?
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:08.920]   - Rhodiola.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.060]   - Rhodiola, rosacea. - Rosacea.
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:12.540]   - Fun word to say.
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.540]   Two words, but the first one more fun to say.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.760]   Rhodiola, rodacea.
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.940]   - Rhodiola, rosacea.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.100]   - Rhodiola, rosacea, folks.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:24.100]   And ashwagandha, I've been trying rhodiola recently,
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.960]   and mainly as a buffer to output,
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.640]   it does seem to have some good data attached to it
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.720]   related to lowering one's perceived threshold
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.980]   of how hard they're working.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.600]   So in other words, you can work harder
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.440]   and not feel as if you're working really hard,
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.200]   which allows you to do more work.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.280]   That's sort of the subjective description of how it works,
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:52.440]   but you told me that it can blunt cortisol,
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.840]   and ashwagandha, we know blunts cortisol.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.760]   Both of these things, of course, can do other things,
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.120]   but are these compounds that you sometimes will incorporate
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.320]   into a training regimen?
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.080]   - I've been using rhodiola for probably six or more years,
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.600]   like pretty consistently, not personally,
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.920]   but using it with the individual you work with.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.840]   You do need to be a little bit careful.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.760]   I wouldn't say that it blunts cortisol.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.600]   It is probably more appropriately described
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.840]   as a cortisol modulator,
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.120]   which means sort of if it gets too high or too low,
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:23.500]   it'll help kind of keep it within normative range.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.500]   There's also, it is important to note,
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.140]   there have been a handful of studies,
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:31.280]   two of, I know specifically,
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   showed that rhodiola use can enhance strength gains.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.560]   However, it may reduce muscular endurance.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.880]   So we need more human data on this stuff,
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:44.260]   and it may turn out that's not a concern.
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:46.120]   It may also turn out to be a concern.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.460]   So nothing is perfect and free.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.660]   There's no supplement that is a panacea.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.660]   And I have used, again, rhodiola in a lot of situations,
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.320]   because the other thing you kind of have to pay attention
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.560]   to with the cortisol is it's supposed to be modulated
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.400]   throughout the day.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.680]   It's not supposed to be at this normal value.
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:06.780]   In fact, if you look at normative values,
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:11.480]   it's typically described in micrograms per deciliter.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.840]   And depending on literally what company
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.860]   you use to draw your blood,
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:16.600]   if you're getting it through the blood,
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:19.660]   depending on which method they use to analyze it,
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.560]   the normative values are frankly embarrassingly
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.960]   all over the place.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.060]   They're mostly gonna be like five to 25
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.400]   as a "normative value."
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.240]   But that's outrageous.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:35.200]   We also know those numbers vary massively by age,
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.900]   by sex, and throughout the day.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.720]   And so if you only are taking a single point,
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:43.120]   let's assume you're doing a fasted blood draw,
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.520]   which is what most folks do,
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.280]   it's really only gonna tell you a lot
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:48.040]   about what's happening in that moment.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.220]   We need to know, well, maybe let's say my cortisol was,
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:55.120]   if I'm a, say, 38-year-old woman,
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.120]   and my 7 a.m. cortisol was 15 milligrams per deciliter,
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.260]   that's pretty good.
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:05.180]   But if it's 15 milligrams per deciliter at 3 p.m.,
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:08.440]   ooh, boy, I'm probably having some issues, right?
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.460]   So there's a change throughout the day,
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.820]   and you need to be able to plot that curve.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:14.140]   So you can actually, well, pretty standard practice
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.180]   that we do is we look at cortisol throughout the day.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.320]   We're gonna take multiple markers,
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.640]   'cause I don't wanna just see your baseline cortisol.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.220]   I wanna see this curve throughout the day.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:24.300]   That's gonna tell me a ton about, again,
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.420]   is your sleep being caused by this regulation?
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.900]   Is it your training, is it something else?
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:33.900]   So I would take a single baseline blood marker of cortisol
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.620]   with a lot of grain of salt.
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:39.340]   We would typically measure it at least three times
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:42.260]   throughout the day, so something like 6 to 9 a.m.,
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.620]   12 to 3, and then something closer to the evening.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:47.380]   Oftentimes, we do much more.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.320]   We'll do like seven points or something like that
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.220]   throughout the day, depending on the situation.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.200]   So you wanna be careful of that.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.300]   Just since we're here,
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:57.760]   you can also get cortisol through saliva.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.700]   And now there's sort of pros and cons to that,
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:02.140]   because the pro of doing it in your blood
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:05.500]   is it's much more stable.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:09.740]   Saliva is extremely responsive to whatever happened
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:12.140]   these seconds before you took that test.
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.680]   The upside of it, though,
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:16.660]   is you can do a bunch of real-world life experiments.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:19.040]   So, for example, we will do this sometimes
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.460]   if we wanna see how an individual is responding
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.980]   to a given stressor.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:23.820]   Let's take it, right?
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.860]   Let's take it, spin it into a tube, we're gonna take it,
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:28.260]   and then we're gonna go do this workout
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.960]   or this cold exposure, whatever we're gonna do,
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.080]   take it at the end.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:33.500]   We know that it's responsive to what just happened,
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.020]   but that's the point.
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:36.700]   So you can actually, there's sort of pros and cons,
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:38.100]   so you'll use the appropriate measure
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:41.200]   for the appropriate question you're trying to answer.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.900]   - Yeah, a couple of points and reflections
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:43.740]   about cortisol.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:46.980]   My first laboratory duty as an undergraduate
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:50.140]   was actually in a biopsychology lab.
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:52.780]   At the time, they didn't have the field of neuroscience,
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:53.620]   as it's now called.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.980]   It was called biopsychology or psychobiology.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:56.820]   - I didn't know that.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.740]   - No, there used to be neurochemistry, neurobiology.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.740]   They had all collapsed into what we now call neuroscience,
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.680]   which was only some years ago.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.700]   But my job was to collect cortisol samples,
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.820]   which means I was collecting spit,
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.460]   which means I was collecting saliva.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.620]   And an advantage of saliva-based cortisol,
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:13.700]   it's free cortisol, it's the active form.
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.240]   As you mentioned, it's reflective of what happened
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.220]   in the seconds or minutes just prior.
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.520]   A couple of things about the regular cortisol pattern
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.900]   across the day, because I realized that
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:23.420]   while it would be wonderful for everybody
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:26.120]   to get their cortisol measured in detail multiple times
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.860]   and blood and saliva and so on,
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.660]   some people just won't do that for whatever reason
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:33.180]   or can't do that.
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:35.340]   The basic contour of a healthy pattern
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:39.340]   of cortisol secretion is to have highest levels of cortisol
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:42.060]   in the morning is actually part of the mechanism
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:43.700]   that's associated with waking you up.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.620]   Viewing bright light, ideally from sunlight,
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:47.720]   but other forms of bright light early in the day
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.780]   actually can lead to a 50%, 5-0% increase
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.520]   in that cortisol spike, which is a good thing.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.580]   People hear elevated cortisol, oh no.
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.740]   But this sets in motion a cascade of things
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.220]   related to enhanced mood and alertness,
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.020]   immune system function, et cetera.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:03.020]   What I think it can be useful for people to understand
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:06.200]   is that many things will spike cortisol throughout the day,
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.620]   stress, cold water, exercise.
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:10.420]   But the idea is that it comes down to baseline
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:13.680]   or near baseline rather quickly.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.980]   One of the worst situations, as you pointed out,
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:19.180]   is when the highest level of cortisol
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.700]   is consistently shifted to the afternoon period.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.060]   In fact, that's a pretty reliable signature
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.800]   of certain forms of depression.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.260]   This is work by my colleague David Spiegel
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:32.740]   at Stanford Psychiatry and the great Bob Sapolsky,
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:36.780]   Robert Sapolsky, of "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,"
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:38.620]   and "Behave," et cetera, and "Fame,"
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.020]   lots of popular books there.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:44.400]   I think that if people are trying to regulate their cortisol
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.220]   and they just understand that basic contour,
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:50.860]   that the baseline should be rise pretty quickly
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:53.180]   after one rises in the morning.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:55.020]   So it's easy to remember, rise, rise.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:58.140]   Rise out of bed and rise cortisol with light,
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:01.300]   bright light, with exercise, with caffeine.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:02.720]   These things will all increase cortisol.
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:05.340]   And then across the day, it's normal for cortisol to spike,
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:07.300]   but then to use some of the downregulation methods
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:10.020]   that you described, in particular the breathing methods,
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.560]   and exercise itself, as the case may be.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.460]   But then to really pay attention
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.060]   to how much psychological and physical stress
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:18.780]   is occurring in the six hours or so,
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:20.620]   or eight hours prior to sleep,
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.020]   does that seem like a good sort of broad contour
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:25.660]   of how to have a healthy pattern of cortisol release?
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.140]   Because you actually want the cortisol
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:29.260]   to reduce inflammation and initiate
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:30.860]   or participate in the recovery process.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:34.780]   - You will not see any progress from exercise training
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.780]   without a large spike in cortisol.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.300]   It is critically important when we think of phrases
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:45.300]   like cortisol, inflammation, stress, this is not bad.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:48.620]   Physiology is not personified, right?
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.560]   Things don't like hate you in the body, right?
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:53.520]   It is not good and bad, they just are.
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.600]   The more you try to suppress cortisol,
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.180]   the more you suppress adaptation.
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:00.140]   What you want is exactly what you mentioned,
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:04.420]   large spikes met with large, quick recovery.
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.620]   And you want to do that throughout the day
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:07.380]   and get that hormetic stressor.
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.620]   So going back to your ashwagandha and rhodiola issue,
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:12.680]   I think it would be very short-sighted
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:15.540]   for people to do that as this is a prophylactic.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:17.900]   'Cause if you blunt cortisol,
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:19.660]   you're going to cause immunosuppressant.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.140]   - Especially early in the day.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:21.980]   - Totally.
[01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:23.500]   - Taking ashwagandha before going to train
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.660]   is counterproductive.
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.220]   - Yeah, this is not a baseline part
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:29.500]   of our foundational package, right?
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:32.560]   If you go look at the athlete foundations
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.180]   or the athlete resilience protocols
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.060]   that are put together,
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:36.480]   you're not going to see these things in there
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.380]   for that specific reason.
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:40.680]   Any form of cortisol regulation
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.460]   needs to be done strategically.
[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:43.860]   If you are excessively high
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.500]   and we're bringing you back down to normative values
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:46.660]   at the right time, then great.
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:47.860]   If you're normal though,
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:51.980]   then taking you down lower than that is actually problematic.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.500]   The same thing is actually true since we're here
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:59.420]   for oxidative stress, foreign information, antioxidant use.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:01.700]   We mentioned, I think earlier about taking vitamin C
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.820]   and vitamin E post-exercise with actually blunt adaptations
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.060]   or at least it has the potential to do so.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:07.960]   Same thing, right?
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:11.600]   If you're modulating this response just because,
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.300]   and you have not done so
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.760]   because of actually biological testing
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.700]   that indicated you needed to do such,
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:20.420]   then you actually may be making things worse.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.020]   And so we see this constantly with people
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:28.020]   who take a number of supplements and substances for sleep
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.940]   and then they wake up the next morning groggy
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:33.100]   and your cortisol is suppressed.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:33.940]   Okay, great.
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:35.980]   So then they take something for stimulation
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:37.460]   and then the rest of the day they're trying to reduce
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.260]   and then they're in this nasty cycle
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.300]   instead of just getting out of the way
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:44.060]   and letting cortisol do what it's supposed to do
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:46.120]   and then making sure again, you're teaching it.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.840]   So this is actually a coachable response.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.860]   You can coach your own body to go down
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:52.240]   in the later part of the day
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:55.540]   and go up in the earlier part of the day.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:56.380]   I mean, you wanna make sure
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:58.780]   that you are driving that train with intent.
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.200]   And so again, to reiterate,
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.660]   if you don't need that, you shouldn't do it, right?
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.340]   If you don't need to lower cortisol,
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.180]   you shouldn't walk around doing it.
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.620]   You're just going to suppress the state even far.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.500]   And this is needed for anabolic response.
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:14.740]   So you're not going to grow muscle
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:16.180]   if cortisol is not spiked.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.900]   It's going to compromise it rather.
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:22.100]   So you wanna be intentional with these practices,
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:24.380]   especially in the form of supplementation.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:25.720]   Be very, very intentional.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:30.140]   - I've heard it said that carbohydrates,
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:34.340]   in particular starchy carbohydrates can inhibit cortisol.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:35.180]   - Definitely.
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:39.620]   - And this could be through the tryptophan,
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.820]   amino acid related pathway
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.380]   that ratchets up to serotonin release,
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:46.860]   probably some other things too.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:50.320]   I mean, the idea that carbohydrates just stimulate serotonin
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:51.820]   is a little bit overly simplistic.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.020]   - No, there's cellular mechanisms.
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:55.500]   AMPK going up and immediately turning it on there, yeah.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:59.980]   - Right, so I think we've all experienced this.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:01.940]   We're stressed, we're stressed.
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.940]   It doesn't necessarily even have to be highly processed,
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:08.220]   fat associated, fatty carbohydrates,
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.100]   like potato chips and potato chips and dip
[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:12.080]   or these kinds of things.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.700]   It can also be a bowl of rice, a bowl of oatmeal,
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:16.380]   a bowl of pasta,
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.980]   which here I'm not trying to demonize carbohydrates.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:22.380]   I do ingest carbohydrates minimally
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:24.900]   or non-processed carbohydrates most of the time,
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:26.300]   but not all the time.
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:31.300]   And they have a fairly potent effect on lowering stress
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.620]   and perceived stress and even quality of sleep,
[02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:36.600]   which is not to say that somebody has to load up on them
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:39.780]   like crazy unless their glycogen is really depleted.
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.560]   We talked a lot about this in the endurance episode.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:42.780]   I know we'll touch on it more
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:45.220]   in the nutrition and supplementation episode.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:48.260]   But in thinking about the relationship
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.120]   between carbohydrates and cortisol
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.780]   and what we've just been talking about
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:54.220]   in terms of cortisol as being vitally important
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:58.540]   for the adaptation trigger or triggering adaptation,
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.460]   it's probably a better way to put it,
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:03.340]   but that it can blunt cortisol,
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:07.660]   take in post-training or maybe in the evening before sleep.
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:10.400]   What are some of the basic ways that one can think about
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:13.760]   and maybe use carbohydrates in specific ways
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.360]   in order to, let's say, control cortisol
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.820]   rather than quash cortisol?
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.820]   - You actually have alluded to it
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:22.740]   a number of times already.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:26.460]   So we oftentimes will give people
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:31.220]   a lot of carbohydrates at night for some of these reasons.
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:32.980]   You're going to feel fantastic.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:35.620]   A lot of people that helps you sleep
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.940]   both get to sleep and stay asleep, sleep quality.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.180]   You talked about specifically,
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:40.380]   remember, think about it this way.
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:45.140]   Cortisol at its core is an energy signaling molecule.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.000]   It says we are in the need for energy.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.980]   Great, epinephrine's the same way.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:53.580]   You'll start seeing, for example,
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:56.400]   cortisol will liberate free fatty acids,
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.240]   put them in the bloodstream,
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.100]   get you prepared to do something.
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.500]   The problem is if it's continually elevated
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:03.140]   throughout the day with no down regulation,
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.580]   we start running into issues, right?
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:06.420]   So again, this is the differentiation
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:09.420]   between oh, my cortisol is slightly elevated all day
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:12.920]   versus I had a really big spike after training.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.380]   I had a really big spike after a breath protocol, et cetera,
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:17.160]   and then it went back down.
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:20.740]   So that being said, if you then ingest carbohydrates,
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:23.660]   it is quick to see the signal, we have nutrients,
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:26.040]   we have energy, again, specifically carbohydrates,
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.040]   therefore cortisol can sort of go back down.
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.780]   We don't need to be liberating free fatty acids
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:31.700]   and preparing the need for fuel.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:34.180]   So you can help yourself go to sleep for many,
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:36.040]   as you pointed out, many mechanisms, actually,
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.540]   of why carbohydrates will help you sleep at night.
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:40.920]   For some, not all people, but some.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.980]   That would be one of the relationships
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:44.500]   it has with cortisol.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.820]   - Great, I look forward to hearing more
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:49.500]   about how the various macronutrients and micronutrients
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.340]   and so-called adaptogens,
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:54.620]   this very mysterious group of compounds.
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.340]   You know, the word adaptogen gets thrown around
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:57.880]   so much nowadays.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.500]   But as long as we're talking about adaptation,
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:03.140]   I think that'll be fair play for the discussion
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.760]   in the next episode about nutrition and supplementation.
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:07.740]   In my laboratory, when we study stress,
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.460]   we use a number of different markers,
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.360]   subjective reports of how stressed people feel,
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:18.460]   heart rate, morning heart rate, heart rate variability,
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:20.760]   cortisol, free cortisol, and on and on.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:24.780]   What are some of the other markers of stress
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.900]   as it relates to exercise adaptations and recovery?
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:31.140]   Because once again, I think we're seeing a lot of parallels
[02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:33.500]   between the study of psychological stress
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.740]   and the study of physical stress
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.900]   as it relates to exercise adaptation.
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:41.780]   - Remember, in terms of physiology, stress is stress.
[02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:44.140]   This is why we have this cool term of allostatic load
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:47.060]   or allostasis, such that it really doesn't matter
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:51.900]   which system you test for, it will reflect overall stress.
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:53.980]   You mentioned several of them.
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:57.300]   We've got done talking about some biomarkers.
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.740]   HRV and heart rate are another great example
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.420]   because what you're trying to do is this.
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:04.180]   When we were talking about the muscle soreness thing,
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:07.060]   what we were really getting at was a marker
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:11.380]   of how do I fix the overuse in that particular muscle?
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.220]   Now we've really transitioned into global markers
[02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:17.060]   of overuse and why these are problematic
[02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:19.940]   or important to pay attention to rather is,
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.140]   again, these are the indicators
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.300]   that you didn't just work a muscle out too hard,
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.420]   but you have actually done something
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:26.900]   where you've compromised all of your physiology
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:28.820]   to a level where you've influenced
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.980]   a circulating catecholamine
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:33.540]   or something that's going to influence multiple markers
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:36.060]   now like your sleep and your mood and your behavior.
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.060]   So that's why these things are problematic.
[02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:41.020]   That said, you could look at resting heart rate,
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:42.380]   not a bad thing to do.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:45.180]   However, that does have multiple downsides.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:47.740]   One thing we do know is your resting heart rate
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:50.900]   will elevate with excessive stress load.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:53.140]   This actually doesn't matter if it is physical stress
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.900]   or psychological stress or a combination.
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:57.500]   So you will see that number drift up over time.
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:58.860]   Here's the downside though.
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:03.180]   It's not tremendously sensitive to smaller stressors.
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:04.780]   In other words, if you were to do something
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:06.360]   like alcohol is a very good example,
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.720]   you will see your resting heart rate elevate
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:11.460]   with alcohol use, excessive tobacco use
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:13.220]   and psychological stress.
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:15.340]   However, if you do something smaller
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:17.540]   like a hard training sessions,
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.280]   resting heart rate is not sensitive enough to pick that up.
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.700]   It will actually probably stay the same.
[02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.020]   So for those reasons,
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:25.420]   we don't actually use resting heart rate that much.
[02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:27.920]   We will take it, but it's not our primary indicator.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:30.340]   That being said, HRV is a better use.
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:33.040]   So just really quickly for those that are not familiar,
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:36.340]   your heart rate, let's say for example,
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.620]   your resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:40.340]   That means every second it's beating.
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:42.420]   It doesn't actually happen on a consistent rhythm
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:43.980]   such that it would beat on second one,
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:46.680]   beat on second two, beat on second three, et cetera.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.340]   The rate is more variable.
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:53.340]   So it might go beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:56.540]   There's a variation in the heart rate.
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:59.060]   And at the end of that 60 seconds, in this example,
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:01.060]   you would have still completed 60 beats.
[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:03.220]   They just aren't on the exact same pattern.
[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:04.700]   Well, one thing that's actually quite interesting
[02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:08.100]   is the amount of variation in your heart rate
[02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:11.100]   is actually associated with your overall sympathetic
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:14.840]   or parasympathetic state such that a large variation,
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.620]   so an arrhythmic pattern is generally more representative
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:20.220]   of being more rested and recovered
[02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:21.780]   and being more parasympathetic.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:24.760]   And you'll notice during times of extremely high stress,
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:29.300]   you will be very rhythmic, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.440]   And so this is a little bit of a confusing idea,
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.440]   but a high HRV is there indicated of a lot of variation
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:39.880]   meaning you're pretty recovered.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:43.340]   A low HRV, meaning there's not a lot of variation,
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.000]   it means you're probably pretty stressed in the wire.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.160]   So it's related to heart rate, but in my opinion,
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.680]   it is a significantly better marker of that.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.840]   Now, one thing you want to pay attention to
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.560]   if you do this, a couple of things.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:01.280]   There are some accuracy issues with many of the devices.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.960]   Basically everybody at this point probably
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:06.300]   has some device that's telling them they're HRV.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.440]   What you do not want to do is simply compare your number
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:12.500]   to somebody else for a lot of reasons.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.300]   Not all of these technologies
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.580]   are actually even measuring the same thing.
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:18.660]   Again, some of them are actually combining
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:21.280]   with other metrics and calling it your overall readiness
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.520]   or your recovery.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:23.900]   And so now what we've actually done
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:25.300]   is made a couple of assumptions
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:28.260]   and then stacked them on a whole host of other assumptions
[02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.680]   and then giving you a number.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:32.220]   And you don't know what that sort of black box score
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.180]   actually even represents.
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:36.600]   So I would caution one against taking too much information
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:37.400]   from that.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.800]   If you are actually measuring HRV, even within that,
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:41.360]   there's lots of ways to calculate it
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.560]   that are not important here.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.320]   So don't necessarily worry about the score.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.680]   Compare it to yourself, but not to others.
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.920]   What you will see is if you use similar devices and techniques,
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.080]   it's hard to find data here.
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.960]   But in general, people that are overweight
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.280]   might have a little bit of a lower score,
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.540]   as in a worse score.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:06.340]   We need more information on that to be clear.
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:09.880]   So in large part, the best way to use something like HRV
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.060]   is to measure it under the exact same circumstances every day.
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:18.460]   So whether you're going to use a device on your watch
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.400]   or your phone or your bed or anything else,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.080]   or you're going to buy a special HRV on it, it's fine.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.900]   Just take that measure at the same time.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:28.320]   Mostly this means first thing in the morning.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.020]   So you wake up, you go to the bathroom,
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.980]   you come back down, take your measure or something like that.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:34.800]   You don't wait-- sometimes you took it before food,
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:37.780]   then after your-- look at your phone,
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:39.980]   like all these other things that can influence stress.
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:42.580]   So it usually takes somewhere between seconds to minutes
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:43.080]   to record.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.340]   So you want to pay attention to that.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:45.800]   Now, one of the things you'll notice
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:48.560]   is there is a natural change in your HRV that just happens.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.680]   And so what you really want to pay attention to
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.860]   is, I guess, answering the question of, well,
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:57.100]   how much of a change in HRV has to happen before I should care?
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:58.520]   And it's hard to answer.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:01.100]   So let's just say your HRV was 100.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.980]   I just made that number up.
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:05.540]   Well, if you wake up tomorrow, it's 99.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:06.940]   What's that mean?
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:08.120]   Well, I don't know.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.400]   If you wake up tomorrow and it's 20,
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:11.940]   that's probably a bad thing.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:13.300]   Well, where's that line?
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:13.940]   It's hard.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:15.340]   One thing I would recommend doing
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:18.180]   is taking your HRV for at least a month
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:20.700]   before you start using that value to make any changes.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.800]   And you recommend taking it first thing in the morning?
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.300]   Yep.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:24.780]   Always roughly the same time?
[02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:26.420]   Basically, under the same circumstances.
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:28.420]   It doesn't have to be technically in the morning,
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:33.340]   because your day will change on most days when you get into.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:35.500]   That's the most stable thing in your life.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:37.340]   So I would take it then, and I would collect it
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:41.180]   for at least a month, maybe even six weeks.
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:43.420]   And then give yourself basically a running average.
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:47.300]   So what we quite honestly do is we will actually
[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:49.340]   track it for forever.
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:51.740]   And then what we always look at is,
[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:54.020]   what does it look like today relative to the last week
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.620]   on average?
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:58.140]   And then what does that look like to our historical average?
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:00.180]   And we always compare those things.
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:03.140]   And you also want to make sure you compare like to like.
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.820]   So in other words, I generally will not
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:09.660]   going to worry about today's HRV score relative to tomorrow's.
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.220]   What I want to look at is today's
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:14.260]   relative to this exact same day last week.
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:15.920]   Not for athletes, but for non-athletes.
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:16.700]   This is very important.
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.300]   So imagine, don't worry about the difference between HRV score
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:21.900]   and Monday compared to Tuesday.
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.660]   Pay attention to Monday compared to last Monday and the Monday
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:26.060]   before that.
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.960]   That's because you typically have the same sort
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.760]   of weekly schedule.
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.580]   And what you don't want to do is say,
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:34.480]   look at Monday's HRV score, which
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:37.060]   is a reflection of what happened Sunday,
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:39.380]   and compare that to Tuesday's, which is actually a reflection
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:41.420]   of what happened Monday.
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.700]   You probably didn't do the same stressors on Sunday as Monday,
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:46.820]   so you're not actually comparing the same thing.
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:48.780]   But if you have a general weekly schedule,
[02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:51.660]   you're likely to compare this Monday's relative to last
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:53.740]   Monday's, because they're both comparing what happened
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:54.900]   on the previous days.
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.540]   Did that sort of distinction make sense?
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.040]   Absolutely.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.040]   I do the same thing with body weight, by the way,
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.660]   if you're trying to track body mass gain or fat loss
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.460]   or something.
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:03.560]   Compare like to like.
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:04.980]   You can look at the daily changes,
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:06.520]   but you need to pay attention to what
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.980]   that normal distribution is.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:11.500]   So if you kind of do that Monday to Monday thing,
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:13.380]   that'll give you a rough area of saying,
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:16.460]   OK, my normal weekly variation is, say, five.
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:20.300]   So my average is 100, but I will fluctuate between 95 to 105.
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:24.700]   That's my standard deviation, as science dorks would call that.
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:29.340]   If you start changing more than 5% outside
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:30.780]   of your normal standard deviation,
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:33.380]   then I'm going to start paying attention a little bit.
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.140]   And I'm going to actually run a little bit
[02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:37.420]   of an algorithm on this one.
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:41.460]   And so here is my thinking process when I get HRV--
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:44.260]   really anti-metric, but HRV is the example we're using.
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:47.340]   First step, did I collect good data?
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:49.140]   And by that I mean, again, did I measure it
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:50.660]   the same way I measured every single day,
[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:52.780]   or did I get up and look at my phone first and I realized,
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:55.020]   oh, crap, I forgot to take my HRV.
[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:56.460]   And then I went back and got there.
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.180]   So say I had a 15% derivation from my normal number,
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:00.980]   and then I realized, oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:04.480]   I was up super late last night doing whatever.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:05.220]   OK, great.
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:07.260]   I'm going to consider that bad data.
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:08.820]   You didn't get it.
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:11.400]   If it's bad data, then I'm not doing anything.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:11.980]   Ignore.
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:12.700]   It's bad data.
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:13.460]   You throw it out.
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:14.600]   You don't use it.
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.980]   If you decide, for the most part,
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:17.180]   let's assume it was good data.
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:17.860]   OK, great.
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:21.740]   Then I'm going on to my next question, which is, is it acute?
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:24.740]   In other words, is it just today?
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:26.080]   Or is it chronic?
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.220]   Is this pattern been happening for more than five days,
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:31.180]   or at least three out of the last four,
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:32.140]   or something like that?
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:33.540]   Three minimum is what I like.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:36.740]   Honestly, I generally look at five or more days.
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:37.980]   That's a very big distinction.
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:40.180]   If it is something that just happened today,
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:43.260]   then the next question I'm going to ask myself is,
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.140]   am I in that adaptation phase?
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.640]   Am I trying to be in a phase where
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.020]   I'm trying to cause an insult to the body
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:50.300]   that it needs to respond with?
[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:53.460]   If that is the case, I'm just going to ignore it.
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:56.180]   In fact, it's almost sometimes a good sign.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:58.960]   Hey, we are stressing the body, and it is stressed.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.620]   What we're doing is working.
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:01.140]   Amazing.
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:03.380]   In fact, if you don't see that, it's sort of like, hmm,
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:05.520]   maybe we're not doing enough to push the phase.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.940]   So we're great.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:10.500]   If the answer is no, we're in a peaking phase,
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:13.660]   then we're actually going to use what I call acute state
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:14.900]   shifters.
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:16.700]   So this is a whole host of little tricks
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:20.660]   that I have that can change HRV or any recovery metric
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:22.780]   within seconds.
[02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:25.580]   Again, these are not chronic fixes.
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:27.900]   This is just, I'm having a bad day today.
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:29.660]   I feel like crap.
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.380]   Can I make myself feel better right now?
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.860]   And so I kind of call these parlor tricks
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:35.020]   a lot of the times.
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:37.140]   And there's 1,000 of them.
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:38.940]   We are certainly not going to go over them.
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.580]   But I'll give you some examples.
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:43.820]   You can pull out-- first of all, physical movement will do it.
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.240]   You'd be stunned.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.060]   I was just doing some yoga, moving around,
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:50.460]   doing some jumping jacks, starting your workout.
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:52.200]   I mean, you've probably experienced this.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.240]   It's sort of cliche in our world at this point.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:57.260]   But if you ever do any serious lifting
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.680]   over a serious amount of time, there
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.020]   will be days in which you walk in the gym and you feel awful.
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:04.500]   And somehow that day, you set a lifetime PR.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:10.460]   Yeah, that's a strange, strange phenomenon.
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:14.700]   I've experienced that more than a few times.
[02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:15.800]   It's rare.
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.440]   The inverse is rare, however.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.720]   You feel great.
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:19.880]   You have a horrible workout.
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.300]   It happens.
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.600]   And it can happen for any number of different reasons.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.380]   But yeah, I think the former, when
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:30.980]   isn't feeling very good and then somehow is a terrific workout,
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:33.380]   does set a kind of a seed of doubt
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:36.160]   as to how good our subjective assessments really
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.160]   are, which I guess is why we're talking
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.000]   about objective assessments like HRV.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.900]   And remember, if it's a single day here,
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:46.440]   you can even do hard training.
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:48.140]   People sort of have this idea like, well,
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.220]   if you get up and your recovery score is down,
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:52.220]   do a lighter day.
[02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:54.420]   That's probably-- I'm probably never making that choice,
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:56.140]   to be honest, not in this situation.
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:59.000]   Remember, this is one bad day.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.720]   And we are in a phase of even trying to improve performance
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:03.460]   right now.
[02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:04.920]   We're probably still training hard.
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.260]   You will, again, often see, I felt terrible
[02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:10.580]   when I trained super hard and it totally changed my day around.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:12.380]   This all can happen.
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:14.820]   So exercise is my first love here.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:17.940]   Absolutely breathing, any sort of upregulation breathing.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:21.340]   So we talked a lot about downregulation breathing.
[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:22.620]   Just do the opposite.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.900]   And so this is when hyperventilation strategies
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:26.120]   can work.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:28.440]   Instead of accentuating the exhale,
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:31.060]   you accentuate the inhale, or you restrict the exhales.
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.260]   This is working in the exact opposite situation.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:36.740]   You can also play little-- this is where things like music,
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:39.260]   motivational quotes, if you're the type that
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.540]   follows people on Instagram that motivates you,
[02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:44.100]   or can work with these things.
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.220]   Coaching tactics, these can be things
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:52.540]   like finding out or talking about that person's why.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.660]   You sort of shared something, a mantra
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:57.420]   you use when you're training hard to keep you go better.
[02:17:57.420 --> 02:17:59.260]   I'm not going to ask you to share that now.
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:01.300]   But some people have this sometimes.
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:02.780]   Or you may have this conversation
[02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:03.500]   with your athlete.
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:05.320]   We call this finding out your why.
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.220]   So finding out why are you really here,
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:08.220]   what are we doing here.
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:10.780]   And a lot of times you'll hear things like,
[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:13.620]   it's because I grew up poor, and I don't ever want to be poor.
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:14.500]   OK, great.
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:15.900]   This is for my children.
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:17.580]   Or any number of things.
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:20.400]   And you can pull that out on these days.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:21.660]   You need to be really careful.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.700]   This is why I call these parlor tricks.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:26.300]   Because when you play that card too often,
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:27.820]   it starts to lose effect.
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:32.380]   And you can only dig to a hole so often before it's--
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:33.940]   the same thing as with music.
[02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:35.420]   Every time you go to the weight room,
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:37.700]   it's blasting death metal at level 10.
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:39.980]   Well, eventually it's no longer motivating.
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.020]   It's no longer helpful.
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:44.740]   So you want to deploy these things strategically.
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.860]   Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind is signal to noise.
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:50.100]   The nervous system, especially the dopamine system
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:51.220]   and the adrenaline system, which are
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:53.300]   a part of this larger system called the catecholamine
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:55.600]   system, so that's dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:58.780]   The get up and go, focus on external goals,
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:01.260]   movement associated, and on and on.
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:07.140]   That system responds best to high signal relative to noise.
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:09.660]   So if you're, as you pointed out,
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.080]   listening to music every time, drinking a ton of caffeine,
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.060]   energy drinks, pre-workout, nootropics,
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:18.340]   and then stacking all those things--
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:20.700]   sometimes refer to this as dopamine stacking,
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:22.740]   informally referred to as dopamine stacking.
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:23.940]   You're doing all those things.
[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:24.820]   And then first of all, then you're
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:27.100]   wondering why later that afternoon or the next day,
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:28.980]   you're feeling like you're under a cloud.
[02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:32.220]   Well, it's obvious your catecholamine system crashed.
[02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:35.460]   But it's also that you don't necessarily
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:36.980]   become dependent on it.
[02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:39.260]   It's just that you start to wonder whether or not
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.580]   you have the internal mechanisms and motivation
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:42.980]   to train without those things.
[02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:44.300]   And so one tends to use them more and more,
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.980]   and then they have a diminishing effect over time.
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:49.900]   The rule that I've been sort of applying
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.980]   has been I never do two workouts in a row
[02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:56.620]   where I'm stacking in stimulants, loud music,
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:20:00.540]   and any kind of sort of high potency inspiration.
[02:20:00.540 --> 02:20:03.360]   However, every set in the gym or when I run,
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:05.740]   I really try and be diligent about form and attention
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:06.740]   to what I'm doing.
[02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:11.260]   The one exception would be the long duration endurance work.
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.780]   Part of the reason I do that work
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:16.220]   is to let my mind go into states of drifting.
[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:18.340]   I'm not trying to think in complete sentences
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:19.660]   or even close to it.
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:23.300]   Just let my brain kind of idle at a low hum.
[02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:27.060]   And for that reason, generally listen to something
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:29.860]   that's more of a story or don't listen to anything at all
[02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:31.460]   and just let my thoughts kind of spool through.
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.400]   Anyway, I don't want to take us too far off track,
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:35.740]   but I think this idea of signal to noise
[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:37.680]   will resonate with the engineers out there.
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.780]   But since most people are likely not engineers,
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:43.340]   it is the way that the nervous system works,
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:45.780]   evidenced by the fact that whatever area of your body
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:49.460]   right now is in contact with a chair or any other surface
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:51.420]   that it's been in contact with for more than a few seconds,
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:53.100]   you forget that it's in contact with it
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:56.180]   because there's low signal to noise at that point.
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:57.020]   - A similar note,
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:20:58.820]   you actually mentioned stimulants basically there,
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:02.100]   whether you're talking caffeine or any other stimulant,
[02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:04.980]   any other cortisol modulators or adaptogens,
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:06.540]   any of these things fall in the category.
[02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:08.540]   If you're not using them consistently
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:09.500]   and you're having a rough day
[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:10.700]   and all of a sudden you throw down
[02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:12.580]   200 milligrams of caffeine,
[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:14.580]   it's going to change real fast.
[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.600]   - That's a strong performance enhancing effect.
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:17.440]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.020]   And for these reasons, right?
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:23.560]   So we mentioned a couple of them, breath work, food,
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.740]   more calories, just eating some food.
[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:29.120]   Sometimes we'll give people what we call comfort foods.
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.340]   So this is just like, hey, you're from Georgia
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.980]   and we know you love grits.
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:35.500]   So we're having grits for breakfast.
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:38.260]   Oh my great, like just something to change your mood,
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:41.160]   acute state shifters to alter it.
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.540]   The other couple of tricks here are light.
[02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:46.460]   So if we know that maybe say multiple people
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:47.300]   are struggling that day,
[02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.100]   maybe we'll put on the lights extra bright.
[02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.100]   We'll bring in some extra things
[02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:51.620]   and just get it more light in there.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:54.220]   And that doesn't even count actually going outside
[02:21:54.220 --> 02:21:56.460]   and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that.
[02:21:56.460 --> 02:21:58.540]   And then other little tricks
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:21:59.460]   that I've learned over the years
[02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:01.400]   is one particular thing I love
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:05.380]   is literally drawing a line, a physical line in the ground.
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:08.100]   And you look at that line and you say like,
[02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:09.580]   I'm going to train today
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:13.720]   and I'm going to accomplish this effort.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.380]   I'm not going to walk past this line
[02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:18.240]   and into that training space
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:20.420]   until I'm ready to give that effort.
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:23.120]   And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever,
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:26.940]   but the physical barrier is very important to saying like,
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.320]   I'm not just gonna get through it.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:31.560]   I'm going to actually perform the way I wanna perform
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:32.900]   or I'm not gonna do it
[02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:34.620]   and I'm not gonna cross this line
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.340]   until I'm ready to make that happen.
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:37.720]   - All right, I really liked that tool.
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:40.180]   It also brings to mind the importance
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:42.860]   of at least thinking about how your relationship
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:47.740]   with your phone during training can perhaps help,
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:50.880]   but also impede workout motivation and performance.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:52.580]   In an earlier episode, you mentioned that if people
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:56.100]   are using their phone to play music during their workout,
[02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:58.900]   that they establish the complete playlist
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:01.240]   prior to initiating the workout
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:03.080]   and then not deviate from that playlist
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:04.780]   as opposed to changing it in the middle
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:07.880]   because there's just too much of an impulse
[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:10.980]   to also check social media, check email,
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:12.480]   check text messages.
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:14.700]   I mean, the way I think about the phone actually
[02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:17.760]   is it's a bunch of little brain areas.
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:19.580]   It's got a memory system for you.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:22.000]   It's got lookup tables for lookup tables.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.420]   It's got websites to look things up on the internet.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:25.380]   It's got photos.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.500]   I mean, it is so rich with sensory data
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:31.240]   and it's so closely linked to our own brain architecture.
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:34.580]   The algorithms are designed for those to be that way
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:35.700]   that I always think about it
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:38.240]   as bringing in a second person with me,
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.240]   but that person is my twin that has severe attention issues.
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:46.260]   And for those that already have attention issues,
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:48.920]   just think about this as a twin that would then compound you
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:51.700]   by tapping on your shoulder, talking to you all the time,
[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:54.900]   interrupting you, somebody that you like a lot,
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:57.880]   but that frankly is a little bit irritating
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:00.460]   in that they're interrupting your ability to really show up
[02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:02.220]   and also your ability to show up for them.
[02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:06.980]   So I started to think about the phone as an entire individual
[02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:08.520]   and that it represents me
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:11.780]   and certainly not the better version of me.
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:12.620]   - Exactly.
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:14.040]   You actually mentioned something else
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:15.500]   that we'll use occasionally
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:18.660]   which will be called brain games or puzzles,
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:20.180]   whether this is a crossword puzzle
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:22.460]   or something where you actually lose
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:25.140]   your thought of self for a second
[02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:26.880]   and your brain gets engaged in a task
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.060]   that you weren't regretting or even thinking about.
[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.500]   These can be stupid little games.
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.940]   It could be little challenges,
[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:35.420]   especially if you're in a group or a team setting.
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.940]   We're going to play one round of dodge ball
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:40.060]   or we're going to play one round of thumb wars.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:41.540]   - So you do encourage this?
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:42.500]   - Yeah. - I see.
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:44.300]   - So you would play a thing instead of warming up,
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:45.740]   it's like, "All right, get in and everyone get going."
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:47.620]   We're going to get your foam roller or your diamond
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:48.460]   or whatever thing.
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:49.460]   It's just like, "All right, everyone line up
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.100]   and we're going to play thumb wars to see who wins."
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:53.020]   Just like whatever.
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:56.340]   And all of a sudden you've snapped into a new mental shift
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:58.720]   or literally playing brain games,
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:00.140]   playing Tetris on your phone,
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:04.620]   like any of these things can work in this acute setting.
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:05.460]   - Can I ask you a question?
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:09.340]   It's not directly related to recovery per se,
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:12.760]   but I think it's worth mentioning or asking about rather,
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.740]   which is the use of mirrors or no mirrors while training.
[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:19.100]   You know, the experience of seeing oneself
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:20.700]   and observing one's form in the mirror,
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.200]   I suppose, has some utility.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:26.020]   You can get some sense of progress that you might trigger.
[02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.900]   You're almost specifically referring to resistance training.
[02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:32.260]   I suppose it could be cardio if you're running
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:34.280]   on a treadmill or pushing a sled or something,
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:37.180]   but you can see form.
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:40.080]   You can get a sense of what your face looks like
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:41.260]   when you grimace.
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:46.260]   But in all seriousness, you are, without question,
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:47.920]   a person, not you, Andy,
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.920]   but one is in a less interoceptive mode
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:54.860]   when looking at themselves in the mirror.
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:57.020]   So the exteroception, perception of things
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:25:58.280]   beyond the confines of our skin,
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:25:59.740]   even if it's a picture of us.
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.380]   Interoception, perception of everything
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:04.160]   from the skin inward.
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:05.940]   And so if we're looking at ourselves,
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:09.240]   we're diverting some allocation of our attention.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:12.180]   Let's say there's a hundred, these are arbitrary units,
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:15.020]   and you can put 50% of your attention
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:17.780]   on the feeling in your body or the muscles you're training
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:20.560]   and 50% on how it appears in the mirror.
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.360]   Or it could be a hundred percent on the mirror
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:23.380]   or a hundred percent internally,
[02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:26.120]   which you best accomplish probably by closing your eyes.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:28.340]   So obviously there are constraints here, certain movements.
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:30.380]   You wouldn't want to close your eyes, et cetera.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:33.460]   In general, what are your thoughts on mirrors
[02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:36.640]   or no mirrors for resistance training specifically?
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:39.220]   - It depends on the metric that you find most important.
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.700]   And what I mean by this is if you're training
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:41.880]   for say muscle hypertrophy,
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.420]   there's emerging evidence that suggests
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:46.940]   actually looking at yourself in the mirror
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:49.920]   and even flexing in between sets
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:53.520]   can actually be advantageous or can augment muscle gains.
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:58.520]   - Oh my, there's support for all the mirror flexors.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:26:59.720]   - Absolutely.
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:01.040]   - Not making fun of you.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:03.240]   I just, it is sort of interesting
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:05.580]   to be on the observing side of that.
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:07.920]   But hey, listen, results are what people are after.
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:09.080]   - Yeah, having said that,
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:13.080]   if you're trying to enhance movement learning,
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:14.760]   then it may be detrimental.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:17.540]   So if you're doing an exercise that is explosive and fast,
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:20.360]   it's probably not the best thing to be looking into a mirror.
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.580]   If you were to walk into any Olympic weightlifting arena
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:26.300]   and you had any thoughts of using a mirror,
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:29.300]   you would probably run out of the gym very, very quickly.
[02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:32.540]   You can't see yourself in time to make an adjustment
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:34.100]   with a movement that's happening that fast.
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:36.060]   And also we'll do exactly what you mentioned,
[02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:40.740]   which is it will remove your ability to understand
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.980]   and feel the movement.
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:45.060]   And so this is a big component to using technology
[02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:47.360]   for exercise at all,
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:50.420]   is you have to make sure that the end point
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:53.580]   is you understanding you and your physiology more,
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:55.420]   not less.
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:58.460]   When you outsource learning to technology, in this case,
[02:27:58.460 --> 02:28:00.500]   even if the technology is the mirror,
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:05.780]   you remove your ability to gain and truly understand
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.480]   that learning process.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.340]   So you need to be very, very careful
[02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:10.700]   whether you're using a mirror
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.580]   or whether you're using any number of apps
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:14.960]   where you can record, say, a movement
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.300]   and then watch it afterwards,
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:17.320]   and it will give you a breakdown
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:19.420]   if your hand was in the right spot
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:20.340]   or foot was in the right spot.
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:21.980]   These are all great.
[02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.500]   But you need to then take the next step,
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:27.660]   which is to say, I need to be able to feel that position.
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:29.540]   All right, so in the case of performance,
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:31.740]   if you can imagine trying to learn a new technique,
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.920]   say running technique,
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:34.900]   and you have to be able to watch yourself in the mirror
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.780]   to understand your stride in the right position,
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:39.460]   if you don't take the next step of saying,
[02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.240]   okay, now I don't have to look in the mirror
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:43.680]   and I can feel when I'm getting out of rhythm
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:44.860]   or whatever the case is,
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:46.820]   then you'll never be able to actually then use that
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:48.020]   in your race.
[02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.680]   And so it's very, very important that people, again,
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.620]   pay attention to what is the dependent variable
[02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:53.420]   that you're actually interested in doing.
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:55.220]   If you're trying to get better at something,
[02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:57.260]   the tech is okay as a starting place.
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:59.660]   It just cannot be the finishing place.
[02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:01.220]   - Thank you for those reflections.
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:04.220]   I'm curious as to what happens or what one should do
[02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:08.260]   if their HRV is reduced for maybe three or four
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.780]   or more days in a row.
[02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:10.680]   - Absolutely.
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.380]   The next question that I'm gonna ask is,
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.240]   and am I in that adaptation phase?
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:18.420]   If so, I'm gonna still ignore it just like I did
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:20.220]   if it was a single bad day,
[02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:22.820]   but I'm gonna start watching it very carefully.
[02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:26.340]   I may actually now introduce some other tests.
[02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:28.900]   So I may use a performance test.
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:31.740]   We may look at something else, maybe ask questions,
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:34.080]   maybe have some communication either with myself
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:34.920]   or somebody else.
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:36.340]   So I'm gonna start paying more attention,
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:38.920]   but I'm still really not gonna take much action
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:42.000]   until that crosses more than seven days
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.100]   of consistent problems.
[02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:47.980]   If it does do that or we're in a peaking phase,
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:50.040]   then I'm gonna go to another set of solutions
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:52.400]   that are truly going to pull me out of the hole
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:55.740]   rather than just be those acute state shifters.
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:58.120]   These are more what I call chronic state shifters.
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:00.060]   Now, some of these are actually very similar
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:02.060]   to the ones we've used before.
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:05.820]   For example, thermal stress.
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:10.820]   So I can promise you if your recovery score is in the tanks
[02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:15.360]   and you walk outside and you jump in your 35 degree water
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:16.200]   and you get back out,
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:18.040]   what's going to happen is your HRV score
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:20.900]   immediately afterwards, I'm talking within seconds,
[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:23.160]   is going to be significantly compromised.
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.900]   In other words, think about that.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:27.280]   Remember a low HRV means a high sympathetic.
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:30.000]   I promise you cold water will put you
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:30.960]   in a high sympathetic drive.
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:34.060]   However, and we've tested this pretty extensively
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:39.960]   looking at HRV zero, 15, 30, 60, 90,
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:43.040]   all the way up to 180 minutes post.
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:45.920]   And on average, you will see your HRV score
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:48.720]   continue to rise after that.
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:52.900]   And so while you have this immediate sympathetic response,
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:56.100]   you will immediately then respond about 30 minutes
[02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:58.720]   on most people, depends on the person though.
[02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:02.520]   And that score will be improved for several hours afterwards.
[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:06.600]   So heat can kind of have a similar effect.
[02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:10.600]   That actually, again, is sort of an acute fix,
[02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:13.240]   but over time, as we've described earlier,
[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:16.300]   that can also have a little bit of a chronic effect.
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.760]   We can also then get into areas like sleep.
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:21.000]   And so now we're going to start playing and exploring
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.960]   why are you sleeping poor as well,
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:27.720]   or was your sleep score fine, but your HRV was low.
[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.040]   That's a little bit of a different answer.
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:30.640]   If your sleep is getting compromised,
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:32.860]   then we're going to start going into and making sure
[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:34.280]   we're improving our sleep.
[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:37.440]   In terms of like brain stuff,
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:41.160]   instead of maybe playing a game or having music
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:42.120]   or some of those other tricks,
[02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:44.080]   those aren't going to really have a chronic effect,
[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:47.720]   but you can do things like work on social connection.
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:51.460]   That's actually been shown to improve recovery over time.
[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:54.260]   You can do things like journaling or meditation,
[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:58.300]   and those have an acute effect as well as a chronic effect.
[02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:00.080]   So again, if you go journal right now,
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:01.580]   you probably feel better,
[02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:03.140]   but also we know that over time
[02:32:03.140 --> 02:32:05.200]   that will gradually improve things.
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:08.460]   So adaptogens and things like that
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:10.460]   also can have a chronic effect.
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:13.420]   So can things like electrolytes or food or hydration
[02:32:13.420 --> 02:32:14.880]   if those things were off.
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:18.620]   So we're going to go to a whole number of areas,
[02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:20.180]   but those are the primary ones.
[02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:22.480]   Outstanding of all that, of course,
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:24.140]   it may be simply a time to go back
[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:26.480]   and reassess our training program.
[02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:27.440]   That's truly the case.
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:29.040]   So that's where we're at.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.620]   If so, we're probably going to
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:32.640]   either completely remove training
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:37.360]   or drop it to like 50% or so
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:40.560]   until we start rebounding back to baseline.
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.980]   And that's generally the numbers we use.
[02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:46.020]   - For many people who are not training
[02:32:46.020 --> 02:32:48.960]   for a competitive sport
[02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:51.740]   and maybe aren't pushing themselves really hard,
[02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:56.740]   maybe they consider themselves somebody who exercises
[02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:59.380]   in order to maintain health and aesthetics
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:01.440]   and longevity, et cetera.
[02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:06.420]   And they never really finish any workout
[02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:07.660]   completely exhausted.
[02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:10.420]   They're sleeping okay.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.380]   Their appetite's okay.
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:15.180]   Can we assume that they are recovering well
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:19.100]   or maybe they're not creating enough
[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:21.660]   of a adaptation response?
[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:23.720]   Like there's no progressive overreaching.
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:26.820]   And so there's really no stimulus for recovery.
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:30.180]   What I'm saying here is on the face of it,
[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:31.280]   I think is obvious, right?
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:34.100]   If you don't train hard, there's nothing to recover from.
[02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:36.100]   What I'm really saying is,
[02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:38.620]   is the ability to recover itself
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:40.340]   something that we need to train?
[02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:43.060]   In other words, can we get better at recovering?
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:47.040]   And the analogy here would be something like focus
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:50.620]   in order to perform work of any kind,
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:53.620]   but certainly mental work and physical work,
[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:55.720]   we need to be able to focus.
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:58.020]   The ability to focus is the reflection
[02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.180]   of a bunch of neural circuits
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:01.020]   and chemicals and hormones, et cetera.
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:03.940]   But we know roughly what those are.
[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:07.260]   And we know that if you are poor at focusing
[02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:08.860]   for every small bit of time
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:10.380]   that you can focus a little bit longer,
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:12.040]   even if it's a matter of seconds,
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:15.260]   those circuits themselves get better at focusing
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:16.640]   and so on and so forth.
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:18.880]   So in other words, is the recovery system,
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:20.980]   however broad, neurotransmitter, hormones,
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:23.900]   neural, muscular, immune-based, et cetera,
[02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:27.740]   can that system or set of systems become better?
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:29.820]   Can we get better at recovering?
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:34.340]   Meaning can it become faster and more effective?
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:36.200]   Can we think of the recovery system
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.220]   as kind of a blade that gets sharper by engaging recovery?
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:43.000]   Because if so, then there's strong reason for people
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.420]   who are not pushing really hard
[02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:47.120]   to push at least a little bit harder
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:49.220]   than is comfortable for them every once in a while
[02:34:49.220 --> 02:34:52.380]   to make sure that that system doesn't start to slide back.
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:55.680]   - Remember physiology is listening to everything you do
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:58.140]   and it is always responding.
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:02.060]   So the analogy that I will meet your analogy with
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:03.860]   that I use here is the bowling alley.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:05.660]   So you've probably been bowling before
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:08.140]   and you've used the bumper lanes, right?
[02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:10.420]   - The bumper lanes, I've gone bowling before
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:12.180]   and I've spent time in the gutter
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:13.780]   and I've spent time on the pins.
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:14.660]   - Okay.
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:15.540]   - So it's been a while.
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:16.960]   We used to have a bowling alley in the town
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:18.580]   where I went to and it was fun.
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:20.020]   We used to slide around on those shoes
[02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:21.740]   and like all the kids would hang out there
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:24.040]   and I feel like, do they still have bowling alleys?
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:25.100]   - I don't even know.
[02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:26.700]   - It feels like something that may have gone
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:29.380]   the way of the mid 2000s.
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:31.180]   - I don't care if no one bills anymore.
[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:32.580]   You're not going to ruin my good analogy.
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:35.720]   - Okay, well my intent wasn't to ruin your analogy.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:37.220]   Okay, tell us about bowling.
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:38.740]   All the bowlers are going to come after me
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:40.460]   with bowling balls or something.
[02:35:40.460 --> 02:35:41.600]   - Right, you're going to get blasted
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:43.780]   with all the stats and elevations.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.300]   - Don't hurt me, sorry though.
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.760]   - Cool, so if one were to go bowling
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:50.120]   and they didn't want to put their ball in the gutter,
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:52.500]   you could put these little bumpers in those lanes
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:54.500]   and these little foam pads that go in the gutter
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.000]   that if your ball is going towards the gutter,
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.860]   it hits those and bounces off and goes back in the lane.
[02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:01.180]   Okay, so in this entire conversation,
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:04.040]   this is actually true of a lot of the way people
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:06.480]   approach their fitness and health.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:11.480]   People are very concerned oftentimes with optimizing,
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:14.120]   meaning I want to make sure I don't go in the gutter.
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:15.380]   I don't want to hit the walls.
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:19.620]   So therefore I'm going to try to improve the accuracy
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:20.720]   in which I throw the ball.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:22.020]   So I want to make sure that I'm throwing it
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:24.140]   down the center of the lane more often.
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:28.880]   And I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:31.580]   so that I don't get anywhere close to hitting the wall.
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:36.420]   However, what they're not realizing is if you do that,
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:39.860]   the body will start shrinking the size of the lane.
[02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:41.640]   'Cause what it basically says is huh,
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:43.960]   we haven't had a ball touch us in years.
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:45.780]   We don't need to be this wide.
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:48.500]   Let's get smaller and smaller and smaller.
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:52.260]   So it's not that you actually are having
[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:55.020]   a reduced ability to recover,
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:58.120]   but you start becoming incredibly sensitive to that.
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.260]   So your two strategies for enhancing recovery
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:04.540]   are to practice getting closer,
[02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:05.900]   throwing that ball down the middle of the lane,
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:10.320]   or to widen, to widen the alley.
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:11.900]   And that's exactly what you're referring to.
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:14.100]   And you absolutely should do that.
[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:16.500]   And so what happens is you don't have to be so precise
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:17.760]   with what you're doing,
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:20.460]   because your ability to handle so many things is widened.
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:23.960]   So if you're off now by four or five inches to the right,
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.540]   no problem, because you've just tripled
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:27.140]   the size of your alley.
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:28.920]   That's exactly what you want to do.
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:30.820]   So paying attention to two things.
[02:37:30.820 --> 02:37:34.180]   Number one is getting better at accuracy,
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:37.560]   maybe staying really tight with your progressions,
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.620]   using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:44.140]   And push your resilience is what we call this.
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:45.480]   In fact, there's actually a biological way
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:46.380]   to measure resilience.
[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:48.600]   We do that in all of our folks.
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:51.040]   This is scientifically validated stuff.
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:51.880]   I didn't just make it up.
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:52.780]   You can actually measure resilience.
[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:54.280]   And there's more and more coming out on this,
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.060]   but that's exactly what that term means.
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:37:58.060]   So how well can you handle and bang things
[02:37:58.060 --> 02:37:58.900]   off the threshold?
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:03.900]   So when you see a reduction in, say, 10% of your HRV today,
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:07.900]   for you, that might make you feel terrible.
[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:12.060]   For me, I might not feel anything because I'm well adapted
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:14.780]   to large fluctuations, and therefore I'm okay.
[02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:16.720]   The less and less you do that,
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:19.300]   the more and more responsive you will be
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:21.020]   to those slight deviations.
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:22.540]   So that is exactly the target.
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:23.980]   And that's kind of what I allude to when I say,
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:26.820]   "You've got to understand what are we optimizing for?"
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:28.620]   Are we optimizing for making sure
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.180]   I don't feel any different today?
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:32.460]   Are we optimizing to make sure when I do feel different,
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:34.800]   I still am able to perform?
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.260]   So this is why you want to do things
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:40.920]   like maybe use some caffeine today and feel great.
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.100]   But if I have to use it every day,
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:44.420]   all I'm doing is shrinking my sensitivity there.
[02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:47.060]   So now if I have to go a day without it,
[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.660]   I can't train at all.
[02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:50.860]   Caffeine is the easy example
[02:38:50.860 --> 02:38:53.060]   'cause people understand how that whole system works.
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:54.740]   But this is really true of everything else.
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:57.460]   So yeah, you need to practice this.
[02:38:57.460 --> 02:39:00.420]   And the way to do that is to give yourself more stress,
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:04.060]   to continue to bring in the stress from nutrition,
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:06.820]   from training, from breath work.
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:09.540]   You mentioned earlier about focus.
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:10.560]   The exact same thing, right?
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.340]   It's not just about getting better right now.
[02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:14.380]   It's about training a system.
[02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.440]   And you can clearly train that, right?
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.460]   We will often say breath work is a practice.
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:22.080]   That's exactly what we're talking about, right?
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:24.460]   So you're practicing getting better at these things.
[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.980]   You're practicing returning your focus.
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:29.300]   You're practicing recovering.
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:30.820]   And quite literally, physiologically,
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:34.140]   you can up-regulate, whether we're talking enzymes,
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:35.620]   whether we're talking about regulators,
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:36.880]   these will be up-regulated.
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:39.500]   So then the next time that insult comes in,
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.340]   it's not as big as, it's not as damaging.
[02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:45.180]   So yeah, absolutely you can and you should strive for that.
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:46.180]   - Throughout all the episodes
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:48.760]   where we've been talking about exercise,
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:52.100]   at the core of that is this word adaptations.
[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:53.980]   And I love that you mentioned
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:58.700]   that breath work can also create adaptations.
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:01.640]   The way I'm visualizing all of this now
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:06.640]   is that resistance training with weights, machines,
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.640]   body weight, otherwise, cardiovascular training,
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:14.700]   running, jogging, sprinting, jumping, and so on,
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:16.340]   thermal training, exposure to heat,
[02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:19.040]   exposure to cold in a dedicated way,
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.000]   and deliberate respiration,
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.340]   AKA breathing or breath work as a practice.
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:30.340]   All of those can be viewed as ways to trigger adaptations.
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:32.060]   And in the context of recovery,
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:35.100]   the specific adaptations you're trying to engage
[02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:37.140]   are opposite to stress.
[02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:38.200]   In fact, with the exception
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:43.160]   of perhaps deliberate cold exposure,
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:44.380]   maybe deliberate heat exposure,
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:45.800]   'cause if the sauna is really hot,
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:47.180]   you can get the dynorphin release,
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:49.100]   which is kind of uncomfortable.
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:52.780]   But still in both those cases, the rebound from that,
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:54.300]   in other words, when you get out, you shower,
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:55.480]   you go to bed, the next morning,
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.740]   you do have this kind of blissed out feeling.
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:59.200]   We know why that is.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.820]   That is the rebound to that uncomfortable situation.
[02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.200]   So it seems it doesn't really matter
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.240]   whether or not you're using resistance,
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:08.740]   you're doing cardiovascular training,
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:11.140]   you're using thermal approaches,
[02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:14.320]   or you're using respiration-based approaches.
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:17.580]   All of these are really ways of both triggering adaptations
[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:22.420]   and if applied properly to actually help you recover
[02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:27.420]   from the stress and create the literal result
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:29.900]   that you're trying to achieve.
[02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:31.400]   For some people that might've been obvious,
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.940]   but I think for many people, including myself,
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:36.140]   this set of conversations that we've been having
[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:38.760]   over the series, these episodes,
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.600]   it's really the first time
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:43.300]   that I've ever thought about exercise in these ways.
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:44.620]   In any event, it's just a reflection,
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:47.680]   but it's one that at least for me is tremendously useful
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.960]   because it has a lot of organizational logic to it,
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:53.240]   which at least appeals to my brain
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:54.620]   because the more that things have a logic,
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:56.240]   the more for me that they become simplified
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:59.500]   and the more that the vast array of tools
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:02.660]   becomes visible to me.
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.260]   As you said earlier, what is it?
[02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:05.560]   Let me make sure I get this right.
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:08.180]   It's concepts are few, methods are many.
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:09.020]   - Pretty close.
[02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:11.480]   - Okay, how would you put behind this, how you state it?
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.060]   - Methods are many, concepts are few.
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:14.260]   - Ah, okay. - Either way.
[02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:15.860]   - The directionality probably matters.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.320]   - It doesn't matter. - No, let's keep it right.
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:19.820]   The methods are many, concepts are few.
[02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:23.940]   - Galpin's Law, in science you're not allowed
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:26.020]   to name things after yourself,
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:28.680]   but you can name things after other people.
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:30.500]   So it's Galpin's Law.
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:32.580]   - Because I'm definitely the one who created that idea.
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:36.580]   So absolutely, that was extreme and tremendous sarcasm
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:37.700]   just so we're ultra clear.
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:40.040]   - Regardless, here we go, Galpin's Law.
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:41.140]   - There you go.
[02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:44.020]   One thing that's in my head right now is
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:47.360]   we've thrown out a lot of options for folks
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:50.780]   and maybe what we can do is try to simplify a little bit.
[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:52.340]   So what I can kind of walk you through
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:56.380]   is how we measure recovery, if you will,
[02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:58.260]   and how often and some tools.
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:00.220]   And what I would recommend people do
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:03.620]   is not use everything I said.
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.400]   You wanna pick one or two things per category
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:08.500]   that are most important to you,
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:11.460]   that are at your cost, that are at your availability,
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:15.300]   that are interesting and important, relevant to you,
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:16.420]   and do that.
[02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:18.780]   The reason I kind of wanted to cover a large number
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:20.340]   of things was to give folks options.
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:22.940]   But again, I wanna emphasize,
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:24.620]   the point is to not measure all of them.
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:26.500]   In fact, you don't need to.
[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:29.220]   I've ran this before with professional athletes
[02:43:29.220 --> 02:43:32.900]   where we've taken blood, urine, every single day.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:34.840]   We've done performance measures,
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:36.960]   vertical jumps on a force plate,
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:39.580]   a whole bunch of things every day for years on end.
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:41.260]   And what I can tell you is
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:44.100]   there is tremendous redundancy in physiology.
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.100]   Everything is everything.
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:46.440]   So you don't need to do them
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:47.780]   and don't feel like you're missing out
[02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:49.380]   if you aren't doing them.
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:51.340]   One or two metrics is probably fine.
[02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:55.120]   I generally recommend one subjective measure.
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:58.020]   This could be as simple as what's your mood?
[02:43:58.020 --> 02:43:59.700]   How do you feel today?
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:00.700]   Great.
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:04.740]   And one objective measure, HRV,
[02:44:04.740 --> 02:44:07.380]   a resting heart rate, anything else, right?
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:09.860]   So if you even literally just did that,
[02:44:09.860 --> 02:44:12.740]   you'd probably have pretty good insight
[02:44:12.740 --> 02:44:13.580]   as to what you're doing.
[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:17.260]   So maybe in fact, I'll go more detail here.
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:18.660]   Maybe I'll give you a couple of examples
[02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:21.180]   of things to measure every day.
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:24.140]   Some things that you should measure maybe quarterly,
[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:26.220]   monthly, and then maybe even some annually.
[02:44:26.220 --> 02:44:28.020]   And then you can maybe just pick a couple
[02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:28.900]   from each of these categories
[02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:31.840]   and have yourself a pretty good monitoring system
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:32.680]   for what to do.
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.020]   And I'll include some that are a little bit
[02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:36.240]   of technology-based and then others
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:39.060]   that are totally cost-free and require nothing.
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:39.900]   Okay, to start off,
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:43.500]   I would recommend taking something like HRV every day
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:45.580]   or most days.
[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:47.300]   If you don't have a device like that,
[02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:50.620]   you could also use, honestly, the CO2 tolerance test.
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:52.540]   And we've talked about that a number of times
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:55.100]   and we probably have plenty of resources to go find that.
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:56.360]   But that doesn't require anything.
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:58.460]   It typically takes about a minute or so.
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.580]   And you can do that under the same circumstances
[02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:02.300]   in which HRV, in other words,
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:03.920]   do it at the same time every day,
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:05.340]   have the same standardization stuff.
[02:45:05.340 --> 02:45:08.900]   And that is actually been in our coaching experience.
[02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:12.200]   While admittedly there's no peer-reviewed research
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:14.420]   on this yet, just in our experience,
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:17.620]   this tends to track extremely closely with HRV
[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:19.940]   and other metrics of recovery.
[02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:23.660]   In fact, we actually did do a pilot trial in my lab
[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:25.220]   and it tracked decently well
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:27.900]   with both state and trait anxiety.
[02:45:27.900 --> 02:45:29.940]   So it's a nice metric.
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:31.880]   Not perfect, but you could take that.
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:34.020]   So if you wanted, you could do both.
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:36.780]   But again, remember, you're trying to capture
[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:39.820]   systemic stress and so you're really just showing,
[02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:42.300]   you're measuring one thing two ways.
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:44.620]   So you don't necessarily have to have them both.
[02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:47.600]   I will do both just because I'm super interested
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.900]   in small differences, but globally,
[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:52.360]   they're going to tell you basically the same thing.
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.220]   So those are two things where we use, again,
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:57.900]   basically daily, year round, or close to it.
[02:45:57.900 --> 02:46:00.740]   If you want to go past that a little bit,
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:04.540]   you can use an actual, a pretty old,
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:09.500]   commonly used survey called a DALDA, D-A-L-D-A.
[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:11.020]   I forget the exact acronym,
[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:13.620]   but it is a fairly lengthy questionnaire
[02:46:13.620 --> 02:46:16.260]   and it accounts for things like how do you feel today,
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:19.860]   how did you sleep, any stressors going on in your life,
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:21.060]   how you've been eating.
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:23.220]   And this is like fairly comprehensive,
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:26.060]   lengthy survey that came out.
[02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:27.880]   I mean, geez, it's probably been around for 30 years
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:28.720]   or something.
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.340]   It's nothing new and been used extensively.
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:33.360]   You would not want to do that every day.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:36.300]   If you wanted to take some subjective measures every day,
[02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:40.840]   we typically stick with, like I said, mood, motivation,
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:42.300]   something like that.
[02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:43.880]   You could perform this DALDA test,
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:45.460]   so something more like monthly
[02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:47.500]   or at the end of each training phase,
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:48.820]   you know, every couple of months,
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:50.460]   and probably worth looking at.
[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:52.020]   It's not going to tell you
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:53.840]   if you're in a bad spot today or tomorrow,
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:55.260]   but you would pick that up with the HRV
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:56.540]   or suit of tolerance test.
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.580]   It would, though, tell you information,
[02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:01.000]   especially if you're working with another individual,
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.680]   about major life changes.
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:05.540]   And if anything, it just facilitates that conversation,
[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:06.380]   right?
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:08.640]   I noticed you reported X happening.
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:12.940]   Let's talk about that and can I help, et cetera.
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:15.420]   So another kind of sneaky, helpful one
[02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:16.700]   is to simply body fat.
[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:20.120]   Like I said, non-functional overreaching and overtraining
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:22.100]   are associated with a number of things
[02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:25.220]   like energy, appetite suppression,
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:28.700]   changes in body weight or body composition.
[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:32.860]   So you can measure that monthly or even really quarterly,
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:34.200]   depending on what kind of athlete
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.340]   or individual you're working at,
[02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:36.300]   or if you're trying to,
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:37.560]   especially if you're not trying to lose weight
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:38.860]   or if you're trying to be at maintenance,
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:40.640]   and that'll give you some insights as well.
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:42.740]   So moving past that, now actually we're gonna move
[02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:45.600]   into the realm of things that we call hidden stressors.
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:47.800]   So those are all visible stressors.
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:50.120]   So hidden stressors, the most common ones
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:53.580]   we've sort of mentioned, and I would probably do this,
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:55.440]   well, you're gonna have to do these ones through serum,
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:57.300]   so this is blood work.
[02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:00.180]   Cortisol, like we talked about, and testosterone,
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:02.540]   then of course, testosterone to cortisol ratio,
[02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:04.280]   and then the other ones I mentioned.
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:07.140]   You can do those quarterly, it's not bad.
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:09.860]   There are some blood markers that there's really no sense
[02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:12.700]   to do them that soon, and there are other markers.
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:15.260]   I mean, in our system, our individuals are getting
[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:18.900]   pretty extensive blood work, saliva work, urine, and stool,
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:20.180]   and so there's plenty of those things
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:24.580]   you just do not need to measure every 10 weeks or so.
[02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:29.580]   In this case, cortisol, as you know, sort of changes rapidly.
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:33.580]   Testosterone can change pretty quickly,
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:36.640]   but if you're really trying to notice a large trend,
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:40.540]   certainly quarterly or so is an appropriate timeframe.
[02:48:40.540 --> 02:48:42.760]   Doing it every four or five weeks is probably unnecessary,
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.580]   so you can save yourself some money and do that.
[02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:46.960]   Other stuff you can look at, actually,
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:49.540]   more like semi-annually in plasma,
[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:52.020]   like glutamine and glutamine-to-glutamate ratio,
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:55.040]   and you can maybe say why you wanna look at those
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:57.800]   for another conversation, but those are important.
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:58.820]   We always look at something
[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:01.120]   from the oxidative stress thing,
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:02.780]   so this could be something like TNF-alpha
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:05.020]   or interleukin-6, something like that.
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:06.560]   Again, we're looking at that in serum,
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.880]   and we're looking at that semi-annually.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:10.840]   And then another sneaky, actually, one
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:15.400]   that I love to look at is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:16.560]   which will give you some pretty good insight.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:18.600]   And again, you could look at that fairly quarterly.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:21.300]   If that number starts to get really high,
[02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:22.920]   certainly more than nine-to-one,
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:24.480]   you got a pretty good insight
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:26.640]   that something gnarly is going on with your immune system.
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:29.980]   So we will actually take action much lower than that number,
[02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:32.360]   but that's a nice cutoff you'll see.
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:33.580]   That's a very, very high number.
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:36.400]   So those are some things you can use.
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.300]   Most folks have the ability, hopefully,
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:39.800]   to get some basic blood work done,
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.160]   get a basic what's called a CBC and CMP.
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:44.340]   If you have a great physician
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:45.560]   and you can get insurance to cover that,
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:48.440]   and you just go on and ask for a CBC and CMP,
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:49.520]   they'll know what that means.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.000]   You can Google that, and they'll order it,
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.400]   and you'll get all the information,
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:55.060]   typically, that I just described or close enough,
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:56.160]   and you'll get some insights.
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:58.640]   And then again, you can just use that free service
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:00.260]   I mentioned earlier to check to see whether or not
[02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:04.580]   the changes are just a matter of testing quality
[02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:06.600]   or actually physiologically relevant.
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:07.880]   - What you just described
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:11.160]   is an amazingly powerful array of tools.
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:13.340]   I'm hoping that you can also mention a few tools
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:18.340]   that are either lower cost, truly low cost, or zero cost,
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:23.220]   that while they may not have the accuracy
[02:50:23.220 --> 02:50:27.160]   or give the complete picture that some of the biomarkers
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:29.340]   and other tools that you've mentioned do,
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:33.400]   that they can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:34.700]   that people can use
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:36.780]   in order to assess their level of recovery.
[02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:37.620]   - Absolutely.
[02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:40.580]   The CO2 tolerance test would be the first one,
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:44.300]   and you can just take that metric anytime you'd like.
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:46.200]   The other ones we've talked about so far
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:48.160]   are things like your mood.
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:49.720]   We haven't mentioned libido,
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:51.500]   but that's another assessment
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:53.800]   that people also tend to have a pretty good grip on,
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:55.620]   and they know what feels normal.
[02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:56.920]   So when things go out of whack,
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.320]   it tends to be a pretty good signal
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:50:59.940]   that people will recognize.
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:02.160]   - Yeah, and one note about that,
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:05.980]   something that came up in an episode on hormones,
[02:51:05.980 --> 02:51:07.740]   both for male and female health,
[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:11.080]   that at some point it will air,
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:15.480]   which is that there's no objective measure
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:18.040]   for people in terms of libido across the board,
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:20.720]   meaning people vary tremendously,
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:25.960]   age, life circumstances, and on and on.
[02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:28.800]   And so this is one of those subjective measures
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:32.440]   that I think people need to have some sense
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:35.500]   of what their quote-unquote baseline really is.
[02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:38.340]   And I'm guessing that the time to assess that
[02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:42.600]   might best be when initiating or midway
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.660]   through a relatively low-intensity training phase,
[02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.160]   maybe during the time of year
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:53.400]   in which all the other factors that can influence libido
[02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:55.660]   are not at their maximum.
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:58.060]   So if you think about light and dopamine
[02:51:58.060 --> 02:51:59.340]   and the relationship between those
[02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:01.180]   and the testosterone and estrogen systems,
[02:52:01.180 --> 02:52:05.500]   we know that libido, testosterone, estrogen in men and women
[02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:07.220]   tends to peak in the summer months.
[02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:09.900]   So if that's your baseline that you're comparing to,
[02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:11.620]   I don't know that that's as reliable
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:15.300]   as being something like the fall or the spring.
[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.060]   And so anyway, this again is very subjective,
[02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:20.600]   but we just encourage people to recognize
[02:52:20.600 --> 02:52:24.300]   that there's no standard numbers for this, no lookup table,
[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:27.780]   and there's no equivalent of the libido BMI, the LMI,
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:30.520]   no disrespect to the acronym that probably is LMI.
[02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:35.220]   So I think that it's just something to keep in mind
[02:52:35.220 --> 02:52:39.620]   as people do comparisons or subjective comparisons
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:43.180]   is don't pick a comparison to an extreme.
[02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:47.780]   Try and pick a comparison to an average as you know it to be.
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:48.940]   - That actually is sort of reminding me.
[02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.820]   One issue that we have seen a lot lately is people,
[02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:54.340]   if they're having libido issues
[02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:57.300]   or just even slightly noticing a drop,
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:59.160]   they just assume that then therefore means
[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.160]   their testosterone is crashing.
[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.400]   And those things are certainly connected,
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:04.780]   but that is not necessarily the case.
[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:07.460]   And where that becomes a problem is then people then go
[02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:12.460]   on things like TRT, et cetera, with no true oversight
[02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:13.820]   and then all kinds of other problems.
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:16.100]   So make sure that if you're gonna take that step
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:17.680]   that you actually get testosterone measured
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:19.280]   and you're working with a qualified person
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:20.500]   to guide you through that process.
[02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:23.480]   Don't just assume because you're having low energy
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:24.940]   or your libido is a little bit down.
[02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:26.820]   It could be simply training related.
[02:53:26.820 --> 02:53:27.900]   It could be sleep related.
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:29.900]   It could be any number of things.
[02:53:29.900 --> 02:53:32.380]   So that's like a little bit of a word of caution there.
[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:34.860]   - Two quick points along the lines of what you just said.
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:36.940]   One interesting thing that I learned
[02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:38.300]   when researching our episode
[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:41.100]   on testosterone and estrogen optimization,
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:42.960]   this was an episode that we'd done some time ago,
[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:45.320]   but is still available on our kubermanlab.com,
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:46.980]   all formats, et cetera,
[02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:50.980]   is that many people actually increase their libido
[02:53:50.980 --> 02:53:54.260]   and even their levels of testosterone and estrogen
[02:53:54.260 --> 02:53:56.380]   as they progress from their 20s into their 40s
[02:53:56.380 --> 02:53:59.900]   if they take excellent care of themselves,
[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:02.260]   including the correct exercise adaptations,
[02:54:02.260 --> 02:54:07.260]   correct body fat to lean muscle ratios.
[02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:08.980]   But of course it can go the other way too.
[02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:11.020]   A lot of people can be training
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:13.640]   to achieve such low body fat stores that libido can suffer.
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:18.640]   So the age-related declines in libido
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:21.720]   are not necessarily written into the script of life.
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:22.880]   In fact, there are some data points
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:24.320]   from a really interesting paper
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:27.760]   I talk about in that episode of individuals.
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:30.800]   This was a study focused on males in their 80s and 90s
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:33.180]   who maintained total and free testosterone
[02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:37.160]   as high as individuals in their 20s.
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:39.120]   But then when you look at the lifestyle factors
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:40.660]   of those people in their 80s and 90s,
[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:43.540]   they were doing a lot to create that scenario.
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:47.000]   The second point is one related to what you just said,
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:47.840]   which is very true,
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:49.980]   which is people generally tend to assume
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:53.680]   that a drop in libido is related to a drop in testosterone
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:56.140]   and then assume that they need
[02:54:56.140 --> 02:54:57.780]   to increase their testosterone.
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:54:59.220]   And in some cases that is true.
[02:54:59.220 --> 02:55:00.060]   - Absolutely.
[02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:01.820]   - But it's also often the case
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:06.060]   that people who take estrogen or aromatase blockers,
[02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:09.700]   that is enzyme inhibitors that prevent the conversion
[02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:11.160]   of testosterone to estrogen,
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:13.120]   experience severe deficits in libido
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:15.480]   because of estrogen being too low.
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:17.640]   So estrogen blockers are as much an issue here
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:19.360]   as low testosterone.
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:22.480]   Then the final point is also one that many people now,
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:25.960]   men and women, I think need to be aware of,
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:28.980]   which is that dihydrotestosterone, DHT,
[02:55:28.980 --> 02:55:33.980]   is among the more powerful androgens for power output,
[02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:36.560]   physical power output, but also for libido.
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:39.300]   And DHT is strongly inhibited
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:41.600]   by certain things like turmeric.
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:45.120]   So a lot of people who are taking a high doses of turmeric
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.460]   can experience drops in libido.
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:52.080]   So there, and who are taking various compounds
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:55.160]   to prevent hair loss, things like finasteride.
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:59.320]   So there's a whole catalog of things that can reduce libido
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:02.260]   that are not directly in the testosterone pathway
[02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:04.260]   that can be DHT-related or estrogen-related.
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:06.220]   And this, I think, points to the importance of,
[02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:09.380]   yes, take a subjective measure of your libido.
[02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:11.040]   Pay attention, essentially be aware.
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:13.760]   Don't obsess, but be aware and try and figure out
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.220]   what factors are involved for you.
[02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:20.600]   But don't immediately assume that what's needed
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:21.720]   is more testosterone.
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:23.840]   And oftentimes the opposite is the case.
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:27.940]   - Yeah, try to put on a lot of muscle with no estrogen.
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:28.780]   Good luck.
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:32.280]   - Right, and indeed a lot of athletes in particular,
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:33.480]   competitive bodybuilders that have
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:35.560]   that saran wrap thin skin.
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:37.280]   If you get to know some of those people
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:40.440]   and you talk to them, they can look like
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:41.920]   the sort of comic book archetype
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:45.520]   of what someone might want to be.
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:46.880]   I mean, that's not what this discussion
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:48.540]   or these episodes have been about,
[02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:51.440]   but oftentimes they can have serious libido issues.
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:54.600]   - I mentioned earlier, and I will emphasize it once more,
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:59.600]   you need to be very cautious when you're taking antioxidants,
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:03.200]   anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers,
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.840]   for all those reasons, right?
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:06.420]   I didn't really sort of get an examples,
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:09.320]   but you just nailed another fantastic reason of it.
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:12.320]   We do not give those things prophylactically.
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:16.320]   I strongly discourage people from just walking around
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:19.400]   taking supplementation of antioxidants,
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:21.820]   especially powerful ones, for no reason.
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:24.160]   If you have done some testing
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:26.240]   and you have a good reason to do so, I'm fine.
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:27.440]   Or if you're in a very specific,
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:30.760]   say training phase or something like that, cool.
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:32.560]   But if you're just walking around doing that,
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:34.660]   you are oftentimes, not always,
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:36.840]   but you're oftentimes causing problems
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:39.560]   that then you then try to solve by
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.620]   taking more of those anti-inflammatories.
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:44.480]   I feel terrible, low energy,
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:46.280]   low libido, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:48.760]   I'm too inflamed, et cetera.
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:53.760]   So yeah, antioxidants in the form of food are fantastic.
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:55.000]   Almost no issue.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.840]   There is good evidence actually there.
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:57:58.840]   So don't worry about, man,
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:02.120]   I shouldn't eat high antioxidant-rich foods.
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:03.060]   You're gonna be fine.
[02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:05.680]   What we're talking about here is pharmaceuticals
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:07.560]   and supplementation where you can take
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:10.200]   orders of magnitude higher dosages very quickly
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:12.280]   than you could in the presence of food.
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:14.760]   So that distinction is also very important.
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:17.680]   Antioxidant-rich foods are generally fine
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:21.160]   and that's consumed in totally absurd concentrations.
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:23.840]   Supplementations, powders, creams, drugs, et cetera,
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:24.960]   is where you can get into problems.
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:26.640]   So yeah, you wanna be very careful of doing that
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:27.460]   unless you have a reason.
[02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:30.180]   We don't do that unless we see a reason
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:31.980]   to do so in someone's markers.
[02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:33.840]   - Yeah, and herbal compounds,
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.980]   despite the fact that they're herbal, can be quite potent,
[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:38.240]   modulators of hormones.
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:41.120]   Ashwagandha being an example.
[02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:43.440]   Two herbal compounds that we've talked a lot about
[02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:46.720]   on our podcast before and repeatedly,
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:51.720]   including in that testosterone and optimization episode,
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:55.360]   Tonga Ali and Fidogia Grestis.
[02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:59.580]   Tonga Ali is now taken by a large number of men and women.
[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:03.560]   Tonga Ali and Fidogia are typically men.
[02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:04.940]   I'm not sure that there are any good studies
[02:59:04.940 --> 02:59:07.840]   about the effects of Fidogia in women.
[02:59:07.840 --> 02:59:10.560]   Those are herbal compounds that can have potent effects
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:14.200]   in increasing testosterone and luteinizing hormone.
[02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:15.040]   Do they work?
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:18.340]   Yeah, they work to varying degrees in most everybody,
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:21.280]   certainly not in everybody, but they do work,
[02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:23.600]   but they work because they're potent.
[02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:24.440]   They have effects.
[02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:29.440]   So the idea that herbal compounds are not powerful is wrong.
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:32.720]   And it's important to remember that that can cut both ways.
[02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:36.800]   Hence my mention of this observation related to turmeric,
[02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:39.360]   which is not to say that some people can't take turmeric
[02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:41.080]   and feel perfectly fine, maintain,
[02:59:41.080 --> 02:59:42.680]   or even increase their libido.
[02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:43.520]   Sure, that can happen.
[02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:46.720]   It's just that for people that are very DHT sensitive,
[02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:47.840]   this tends to be an issue.
[02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:51.040]   So unfortunately, for many of these compounds,
[02:59:51.040 --> 02:59:54.420]   the only way to find out is really to try them
[02:59:54.420 --> 02:59:56.440]   or to just completely avoid them and decide
[02:59:56.440 --> 02:59:58.000]   you don't want to try them is fine too,
[02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:01.480]   but there really aren't ways to predict who will respond,
[03:00:01.480 --> 03:00:03.880]   who won't, and who will be hyper responders.
[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:08.680]   And in that case, it's a little bit of a wild west.
[03:00:08.680 --> 03:00:12.200]   - I'm also sort of remembering what the point
[03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:13.840]   of this conversation was supposed to be,
[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:15.880]   and maybe I'll return back to that,
[03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:20.120]   which were some cost free or low cost metrics.
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:21.800]   That was a very fun tangent.
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:24.960]   But nonetheless, another couple of ones you can do
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:27.760]   are grip strength testing.
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:32.760]   So if you buy a fairly cheap hand grip dynamometer
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:36.840]   on any number of places, these are typically
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:39.200]   able to be purchased for 20 to $40
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:40.880]   or something like that, right?
[03:00:40.880 --> 03:00:42.660]   You can actually just test that every day.
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:44.960]   I've done that in a number of athletes
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:46.720]   for a decent amount of time.
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:48.880]   Admittedly, I don't do it anymore.
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:50.340]   And that's not because I disagree with it,
[03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:53.520]   but because we just were getting the information already
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:54.520]   and it was just too redundant.
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:57.680]   But if that's the only option, it is a great one to do.
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:02.360]   I mentioned also earlier how I actually like speed tests,
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:04.820]   over-strength tests, as an earlier indication
[03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.520]   of overreaching.
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:09.240]   And so because of that, I like a vertical jump test.
[03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:11.600]   If you have access to a force plate, that's great.
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:14.480]   And then you can get more in-depth characteristics
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:16.760]   of the force velocity curve and acceleration
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.120]   and things like that.
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:20.460]   Used a lot in high performance situations.
[03:01:20.460 --> 03:01:23.560]   If not, simply looking at your performance.
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:25.880]   And so you can kind of go back to one of our earlier
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:28.240]   episodes when I described coloring my fingertips
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:30.420]   with highlighters earlier in my life.
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:32.380]   You could do the same thing and go out in your garage
[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:35.060]   and every day jump up and touch that marker
[03:01:35.060 --> 03:01:36.760]   and see where you're at.
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:39.100]   So a system like that could be done.
[03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:43.280]   You can also use tools like force transducer
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:45.120]   and do a standard movement.
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:48.120]   I can say a vertical jump or a high pole
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:50.100]   or something like that and measure the velocity
[03:01:50.100 --> 03:01:52.720]   and just compare that day to day of a standard load, right?
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:55.740]   So you do it every single time with the same load.
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:59.420]   Similar thing could be done with like a medicine ball throw.
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:01.440]   So you have the same ball, you throw the same thing
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:02.960]   and just sort of where you're at today.
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:04.400]   You want to do a little bit of warmup
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.400]   but not excessive here.
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:08.280]   You want to kind of get an idea of where your baseline is
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:11.340]   and you don't want to influence it by the veracity
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:12.940]   of the warmup every single day
[03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:14.400]   'cause that alone can change it.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:15.800]   Same thing with stretching.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:20.360]   Acute static stretching directly influences power production.
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:21.920]   So you don't want to go out there and one day
[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:24.600]   do a 20 minute stretch before and then the other day
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:26.200]   you didn't stretch at all 'cause that alone
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:29.000]   will cause deviations in your performance.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.900]   So try to keep everything you can think of standardized
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:34.520]   and that'll give you a little bit better data.
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:39.020]   Remembering all of these values, the biomarkers,
[03:02:39.020 --> 03:02:42.160]   the performance stuff, they have normal variations.
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:44.120]   You just want to figure out first and foremost
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:46.420]   what those normal variations are for you.
[03:02:46.420 --> 03:02:48.480]   So you have your normal number,
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:50.680]   you have your standard deviation.
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:52.800]   When you start getting outside of that standard deviation
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.920]   you start paying attention.
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:54.760]   And so that's kind of like
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:57.340]   what we typically call that the gray zone.
[03:02:57.340 --> 03:02:59.020]   And so if it's in the gray zone, we're fine,
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:02:59.860]   we're not adjusting.
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:02.080]   But if it's outside of that, whatever that is for you,
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:06.080]   recognizing that the gray zone is smaller for some folks
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.240]   and larger for others,
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:09.760]   but what is normal for you and your situation.
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:12.680]   And then you can make your decisions outside of that
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:15.100]   when you see numbers that are consistently
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:18.880]   or more than three to five days in a row or close.
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:21.240]   Four of the last five days, four of the last six,
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:22.760]   something like that.
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:26.240]   And then you maybe have some cause for action.
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:27.860]   - Well, that was an incredible description
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:31.420]   of the various tools and modes for recovery.
[03:03:31.420 --> 03:03:33.520]   And I realized I jumped the gun a bit
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.240]   during our discussion about food and supplements,
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:41.400]   but I like to think that it serves as a nice precursor
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:42.560]   to the next episode,
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:45.760]   which is going to be all about nutrition and supplementation.
