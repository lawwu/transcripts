[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Charlie writes in to ask a sobering question.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.880]   Pastor John, what can a person do
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.600]   to restore the softness of their conscience?
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.280]   I once had a softer conscience
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.220]   towards impurity, injustice, and sin in general.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.880]   I desire to restore my heart to a sensitive state,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560]   but feel as though time and the world
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820]   have made it very calloused.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.080]   I want sin to bother me more.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.840]   How can one gain back a tender and sensitive heart
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   towards these things?
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.000]   - I love the spirit of that question.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.240]   It's a beautiful longing,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.380]   and it points in a frightening way
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.760]   to a really clear biblical reality,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.480]   namely that believers can drift
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   into calloused, hard, indifferent frames of heart.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.200]   Basically, Charlie, I think,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.040]   is asking how to reclaim his heart
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.720]   when Hebrews 3, 12 to 13 has begun to happen.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.200]   Here's what that says.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.840]   Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.920]   an evil, unbelieving heart,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.680]   leading you to fall away from the living God,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320]   but exhort one another every day,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.660]   as long as it is called a day,
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.400]   that none of you may be hardened,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.200]   none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.240]   So we're hardened by sin's deceit,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.280]   and Charlie has described it clearly.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.680]   He said, "I once had a softer conscience
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.660]   "toward impurity and justice, sin in general.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.840]   "I want it back.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.000]   "I want to restore that sensitivity
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.660]   "so that I won't be callous.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660]   "I want sin to bother me more.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.200]   "How can I gain back a tender, sensitive heart?"
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.840]   And that's exactly what Hebrews 3, 13 says.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.640]   We can lose, we can become hardened
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.320]   by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   So I'm very, very thankful that God has arrested Charlie
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.120]   before it's too late, which he clearly has
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.960]   in the way he's asking that question.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.180]   The key in this text is pretty clear.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.000]   Sin is deceitful.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.660]   Don't be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.580]   It lies to us.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.760]   It tells us that there's no problem
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.800]   with doing wrong, thinking wrong,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.960]   watching wrong, speaking wrong.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   It lies to us.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   And the solution to the hardening effect
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.940]   of those lies is truth.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.060]   The opposite of being deceived is being shown the truth,
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.080]   seeing and loving the truth.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.920]   So here's what I would suggest to Charlie.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.560]   Number one, these are from my experience
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.680]   and from the Bible.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.560]   Number one, get a copy of Jonathan Edwards' book,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.580]   "The Religious Affections."
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.840]   You get paperback, and I would suggest,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.760]   not a paraphrase, but the original wording.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   "No book had a greater impact on making me hate my sin
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.180]   and long for holiness as much as that book."
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.880]   There may be other books that do it better
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.660]   for different people, but in 1971, '72,
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.200]   sitting in a rocking chair on Sunday evenings,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   reading that book very slowly,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   was a unforgettably devastating and glorious experience
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.880]   of being filled with the horrors of sin
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.520]   and the glories of holiness and the desire for the latter.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   Number two, recently I read Stephen Westerholm's
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.600]   new little book, "Justification Reconsidered,"
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.920]   and there's a chapter in there
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.900]   on the depth and seriousness of sin,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.600]   and it had a very similar effect.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.560]   So if you want a shorter, small thing,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.620]   that little chapter on Paul's view
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.440]   of the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.840]   in other words, we just need help
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.480]   from the Westerholms and the Edwardses of the world
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.620]   who have thought deeply and seen deeply about these things.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.280]   We need to be confronted with truth about sin
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.660]   so that it wallops us like it may not be walloping us
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.820]   when we are reading the Bible for ourselves
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.520]   because we've got some kind of blinders on
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.280]   that these guys may break through.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.800]   Number three, on the other side,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.760]   God uses beautiful portraits of purity and holiness
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.080]   to fill us with a longing for goodness
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.240]   and a tenderizing, a melting sense
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   of how wonderful it would be to be a kind
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.280]   and godly and tenderhearted person.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   So here I would say, get Jonathan Edwards,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.040]   "Heaven is a World of Love."
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.240]   It's the last chapter of "Charity and Its Fruits,"
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.000]   which is an exposition of 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   And the whole book might have the same effect,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.080]   but for me, that chapter was one of the most glorious
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.740]   and beautiful descriptions of holiness and goodness
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.040]   and beauty and what God is for us
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.120]   and what we can be in Him.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.540]   I was just blown away reading that with my wife years ago.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.140]   Number four, pray that God would deliver you.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.920]   And so underline the word pray.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.360]   Pray that God would deliver you from hardness
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.920]   and make you tender.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   Believe it or not, Charlie, I have on my phone
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.760]   an app called Do in which I can set reminders for me.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   And I have a reminder set for every single day,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.600]   the verse, "Be kind to one another,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.040]   "tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.800]   And I chose that verse as a daily reminder.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's been there for weeks because of the word tenderhearted,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.920]   because I felt like you.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.280]   I don't want to grow calloused or hard towards God,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.600]   towards my daughter, towards my wife,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.140]   towards my kids, towards anybody.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.800]   I want to be a tenderhearted man with a steel of spine,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.920]   but a heart of warmth and kindness and patience.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.820]   And so join me in daily prayer reminders
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.660]   to go hard after God in asking Him to do that miracle.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.560]   Number five, surround yourselves with those
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.640]   who are sensitive to sin and who love holiness.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.600]   That's the point in the text, isn't it?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.280]   Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.200]   lest there be this hard heart in you.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   So evidently community is helpful.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.480]   And a text that doesn't get quoted very often
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   because I think we tend to think
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.240]   it might be a little bit moralistic.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.600]   First Corinthians 15, 33, Paul said,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   "Bad company corrupts good morals."
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.200]   And I read it in Greek this morning
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.320]   just to make sure I had it.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   And it's interesting that it is talking about,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.420]   when it says good morals, it's kind morals, kindness.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.160]   It corrupts kindness.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.400]   And so I would say, I don't know who you're hanging out with
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.560]   but a lot of Christians I think are trying to be missional
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.880]   by hanging out with worldly people.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.840]   And it turns out they're not being missional,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.300]   they're being malleable.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.760]   You didn't convert them, they conformed you.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   And so now you're loving all the same things they love
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   because you were watching all the same movies
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.920]   and hearing all the same stories
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   and using all the same language.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.720]   And suddenly you realized,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.520]   I guess I wasn't being as missional as I thought I was.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.360]   And I was just enjoying myself with ungodly people
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.320]   and I have absorbed their values.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.480]   And if that's the case, you probably need some new friends
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   who are loving holiness and loving or hating sin.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   Last piece of counsel.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.080]   Be in a worshiping community where every Sunday
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.620]   you stand with God's people in heartfelt praise
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.920]   to God for His mercy.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.840]   Focus on the beautiful love of Jesus for you in worship.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.160]   In particular, say with Paul, sing with Paul.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.680]   He loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.040]   I close with this because it's been my experience
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   in all my pastoral ministry that to stand
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.560]   and let the singing of the people cascade over me
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.720]   while I join them in it,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.860]   it has been melting and softening to my soul,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.140]   my heart, like few things have been.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.200]   And thank you, Charlie, for the humble question.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.520]   If you have a question for Pastor John,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.000]   please email it into us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.740]   And there were a couple of book recommendations
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.640]   in this podcast.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.580]   First, an old book by Jonathan Edwards
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.760]   titled "Charity and Its Fruits."
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.380]   Most recently, that book has been edited by Kyle Strobel
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.520]   and released in 2012 by Crossway
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.880]   under the title "Charity and Its Fruits,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.200]   Living in the Light of God's Love."
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.280]   Also, Pastor John mentioned a new little book,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.720]   "Justification Reconsidered" by Stephen Westerholm.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.240]   Both books can be found online.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.720]   Well, can a sovereign God ever be surprised?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.920]   That's the question tomorrow,
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.380]   and it comes from a curious little passage
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.180]   in Jeremiah 19, verses four and five.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.520]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.120]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
