[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Well, yesterday we started the week,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.320]   week number 500 on the podcast, by the way, it's amazing.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.740]   We started this 500th week on the podcast
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.440]   looking at Christian love
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.280]   and how that love differs from the love of the world.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.520]   And I want to carry that discussion over today
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.960]   because there's another key factor
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.920]   that distinguishes our Christian love
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920]   and it's about money, the fear of money,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.220]   specifically the fear of not having enough money.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.340]   Money fears kill our love and money fears kill our worship.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.680]   Key points made by John Piper in a 1997 sermon on Luke 12.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.040]   Here's Pastor John to make those connections.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.980]   - So Luke 12, 32 to 34 of the dozens of texts
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.980]   I could have chosen is all about worshiping God
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.480]   with your money.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920]   There are four points I want to make.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040]   Many more could be made.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.120]   I think I counted about 10 sermons
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.500]   I'd like to preach on these three verses,
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500]   but I'll preach one and make four points.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.760]   Number one, in verse 32 in particular,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.440]   the first point is God commands us
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.380]   not to be afraid about money, not to have fear about money.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.840]   When it comes to money things,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.200]   we're not supposed to be anxious.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   Don't worry, don't be afraid, he says, little flock,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.440]   for your father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.200]   That little verse there is sandwiched
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.900]   before and after with money.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.720]   Verses 22 following are all about money,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   things, clothing, house,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   and whether you're anxious about them
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   and then it's followed by selling possessions
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.000]   and giving alms and laying up treasures in heaven
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.840]   instead of on the earth.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.060]   So this little verse,
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.920]   this beautiful, magnificent promise verse,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   the first point is don't be anxious, don't be afraid.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.800]   But now there's a deeper point in this verse
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   and the deeper point is that when you're not afraid
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.280]   concerning money, you magnify five things about God.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.760]   And that's worship.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.800]   When you're not afraid or anxious or fearful about money,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.680]   you magnify five things about God in this one verse.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.200]   And when you magnify God
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680]   through not being afraid about money, you worship.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.160]   Here are the five things.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.880]   These are precious things that we want to magnify about God.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   Number one, when we're not afraid about money,
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000]   we magnify God as our shepherd.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Do not be afraid, little flock.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   The word flock means we've got a shepherd and we are sheep.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.280]   And therefore Psalm 23 kicks in,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not what?
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   Want.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   That word is the old Elizabethan word for lack.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.360]   I shall not lack, I shall not be in want.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   That is, if I have a shepherd like this
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.360]   who loves to give me the kingdom,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720]   I will not lack for what I need.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   Therefore, if I believe that and thus exclude fear,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.400]   I will magnify his shepherd love.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   Number two, if I do not fear concerning money,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.040]   I show that I treasure God as my father.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.640]   Do not be afraid, little flock,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   for your father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.880]   So not only am I or are we sheep who have a shepherd,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.400]   we are children who have a father.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   He's multiplying images for us here to get rid of fear.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.240]   That's what he's doing.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.520]   Don't be afraid, you're sheep who have a shepherd.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   Don't be afraid, you're children who have a father.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.300]   Now, what does that imply?
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.420]   Well, verse 30, two verses earlier,
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.360]   makes pretty plain what it implies.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.360]   All these things, eat, drink, wear, money things,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.880]   all these things, the nations of the world eagerly seek,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   but your father knows that you need these things.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.320]   Now, he didn't say that to mock us.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.440]   He said that because knowing that we need these things,
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.920]   he'll work to provide what we need
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.520]   in order to magnify his fatherhood.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.880]   But now be careful.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   Do not come to God with an agenda
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   defining for him what you need.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.680]   Come to God and learn from him what you need.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.480]   The word need today in America is so inflated
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.680]   that it scarcely has any meaning
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.960]   in a universal context anymore.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.520]   So if we are fearless about money,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.280]   we magnify him as shepherd,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.320]   we magnify him as father, and that is worship.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.560]   Thirdly, if we're not afraid concerning money,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.640]   we show that we treasure God as our king.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.260]   Do not be afraid, little flock,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.260]   for your father has chosen gladly to give you the what?
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.000]   Kingdom.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.800]   Who has right and authority to give us the kingdom?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.480]   No peon disposes of the kingdom.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.160]   The king disposes of the kingdom.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   And therefore, not only is he a shepherd
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   loving us as sheep, father loving us as cattle,
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.260]   children, he is king, ruling us, providing for us,
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.580]   exerting sovereignty and power on our behalf
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.160]   as subjects against our enemies,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.660]   including the lack of things we need.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.580]   So if we trust him as king and shepherd and father
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.560]   and thus overcome our fear of not having enough money,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.180]   then we magnify him and he is worshiped.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.180]   Fourth, if we are fearless with regard to our money,
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.740]   we magnify him as free and generous.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.500]   Do not be afraid, little flock,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   for your father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.060]   not sell you the kingdom, not rent you the kingdom,
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.220]   not lease you the kingdom for payments,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.540]   mortgage payments, rent payments, lease payments.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.220]   He will give you the kingdom.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.980]   He loves to give you the kingdom,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.740]   which means he's generous.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.420]   And therefore, if we let his shepherd-like,
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   fatherly, kingly generosity work on our fear,
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.100]   our anxieties, and I'm talking a battle here.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.180]   You know I'm talking a battle here, right?
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.140]   We're not talking something that happened yesterday
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.060]   and doesn't happen tomorrow.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.060]   We're talking a weekly thing, a paycheck by paycheck thing,
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.300]   or unemployment check by unemployment check thing.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.220]   We're talking a battle here.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.260]   The way we battle is by preaching to ourselves
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.340]   what I'm preaching right now.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.780]   That's the way I do it.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.740]   It ain't automatic for John Piper
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.520]   to be fearless about money,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.480]   though I get paid plenty, way plenty.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.020]   It isn't automatic for me.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.380]   It isn't automatic for you.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.700]   We are battling fear and anxiety every day,
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.980]   not to mention greed.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.620]   And we do it by saying, he's shepherd to me,
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.540]   he's father to me, he's king to me.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.540]   And he's not as shepherd, father, and king,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.940]   folding his arms, standing off in the corner,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.260]   saying, maybe, maybe you'll get the kingdom.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.180]   I'll watch your performances.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.540]   It's not the way he does it.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.540]   Give, give, give, free, free, free is what the Lord does.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:12.060]   And fifthly, when we overcome our fear
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.900]   and live free of fear, we magnify our God as happy.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.500]   In his giving.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.900]   Do not be afraid, little flock,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   for your father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.980]   Or it is his good pleasure, another version says,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.040]   to give you the kingdom.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.500]   Or another version, it pleases him.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.060]   He's pleased to give you the kingdom.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.960]   He wants to do this.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.260]   He is not selfish.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.260]   Simony is not his virtue or vice.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.660]   He is a generous God.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.540]   So, the first point of this message is,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.100]   trust him as shepherd.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.200]   Trust him as father.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.300]   Trust him as king.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.060]   Trust his generosity and trust the fact
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.420]   that it's lavish because he loves to do it.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.620]   Preach these things to yourself
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.700]   and attack fear and anxiety in your life
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.380]   with these truths so that when you overcome
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.460]   fear about money, God gets the glory.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.820]   These five glorious things shine out of your life.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.300]   And if anyone asks you,
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.920]   I know that you're in financial straits
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.020]   and yet at work you seem to be caring about others
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.260]   and fairly happy.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.140]   How is that?
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.740]   Then you say, can I share five things with you
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.420]   about my God?
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.580]   And he is worshipped.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.460]   He is worshipped.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.300]   - What freedom, what freedom.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   - To worship God free from the fear of money.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.500]   Others will notice that.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.900]   This sermon clip was taken from John Piper's message
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.420]   on Luke 12 titled, "Magnify God with Your Money"
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.700]   and preached on December 14th, 1997.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.460]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.420]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.220]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.860]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.140]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.660]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.

[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.980]   Well, Friday we close out the week with a Bible question
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.380]   about how the new birth works.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.180]   The sharp question, as you would expect.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.020]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.660]   We'll rejoin in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.580]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:10.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
