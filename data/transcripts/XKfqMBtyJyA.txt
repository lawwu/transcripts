[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.880]   - But just to start with a couple of questions from me,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.900]   most overrated issue in investing.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.040]   Let's start with the thing that you think
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.160]   people make way too much out of
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.460]   that at the end of the day doesn't matter a lot.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.320]   What is the question you get again and again
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   and kind of go, doesn't really matter.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.680]   - Is small cap value, can we include that in there?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700]   But if we weren't gonna go down that road,
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.800]   I'd say rebalancing.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.080]   By the financial industry, a lot of advisors say,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760]   well, we rebalance your portfolio
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.100]   and therefore we earn an extra 2% annualized return
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.860]   by doing it, which is nonsense.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.920]   So I'd say that rebalancing is kind of overrated.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.240]   - Adam, rather, yesterday touched on this.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.960]   I have an analogy that I often use about asset allocation.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.080]   If you've ever baked a cake before,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.700]   then you know that you start with basically
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.200]   some dry white powdery stuff, right?
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.840]   Flour, sugar, salt, leavening, and some butter and eggs.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   And then when you mix them together
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   in exactly the right proportions,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.160]   cook it at exactly the right temperature
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080]   for exactly the right length of time, magic happens, right?
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   You go from butter, eggs, and powdery stuff to a cake.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.240]   But if you mess it up, if you get the proportions wrong,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.040]   the temperature wrong, you leave out the leavening,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   whatever, it's a disaster.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.360]   And a lot of people will tell you
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.760]   that asset allocation is the same way, right?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   If you get the small cap value tilt exactly right,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.480]   if you use a 10% retail allocation,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.520]   or you make sure to use short-term treasury bonds
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   instead of a total bond fund, or whatever it is.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.520]   But asset allocation is not like baking a cake,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   it's like making a fruit salad, right?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.440]   If you just increase your blueberry allocation
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.520]   a little bit, it's not a big deal.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.080]   Like, there's no magic, it's no disaster,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.280]   you just have more blueberries.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.640]   And that might be good, or it might be bad,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   but it's not a big deal.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   And if you go to the grocery store,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   and the raspberries and blackberries look kinda iffy,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   and so you end up with a three-ingredient fruit salad,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   that's fine.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.640]   - I'm gonna say I, is this on?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.440]   Yeah, I'm gonna say I actually agree with Rick.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   When to rebalance, and looking at history,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   you could see a whole lots of reasons when to do it,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   but I think as long as you rebalance,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.320]   as long as you buy when stocks are on sale,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.280]   and sell when they're high,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.400]   you're gonna get a boost of a return
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.600]   versus that average asset allocation.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.240]   - Yeah, I'm severely disadvantaged here two ways.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.320]   Number one is I'm the last to answer,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   so I agree with all three of these guys.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   And the second thing I've learned
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   is to never match Sinalese with Mike Piper, so.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.200]   - We start on that side and go this way?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.440]   - Yeah.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.720]   - So Bill, this one's coming right at you.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.680]   You are all intelligent and great money managers.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.840]   How do you treat yourself or blow money?
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.880]   Is it a trip, car, knowing you have plenty of money?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.000]   What is it, what's your splurge?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680]   - I just paid $100 extra to fly business class
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.400]   back to Portland, and that's, you know,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.800]   that's the first, that's almost as good
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   as the threads you see on the board,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.680]   which, you know, can I buy my Rolex now?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   Am I, you know, will I go to hell
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   if I buy a Rolex to Boglehead L?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   - Do you pay for first class if you're going overseas?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200]   - That's a really good question.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   I haven't really faced that.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   I occasionally, we fly Iceland Air,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.360]   and you can bib on first class,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.760]   and sometimes I win and sometimes I lose.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.680]   - I have a dysfunctional relationship with money.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   - And I even wrote about this.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.760]   As an Uber saver, it's hard to start spending money,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.920]   and I've done a little research on that,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.840]   and I'm very proud.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.000]   We flew premium economy to Europe.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.400]   It's been two weeks there, and it cost $20,000,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.520]   and it's the first time I bragged
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.200]   about how much something costs.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   I'm usually bragging about the $1 tram ride
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.000]   from the airport to the hotel.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.560]   - I take a quick trip to Colorado Springs,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.880]   have breakfast with Alan Roth,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.840]   and then spend a little bit of time climbing.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.200]   - So how do I splurge on money?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.040]   - On yourself.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.720]   What do you do? - I have a wife.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.760]   She, we did go to Europe last year,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.800]   and of course I was all about the economy class,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.360]   even though I was gonna be in the middle in row 87,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.160]   and she was gonna be in the middle in row 76.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   She said, "We're flying business class,"
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   or, "I'm not going."
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   So we flew business class, which was great, by the way,
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.120]   and so we'll probably do that.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.440]   In fact, I know we're gonna do that.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.000]   If I ever wanna go to Europe again,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.360]   we're gonna be flying business class.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.360]   But the second thing that I do for myself
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.640]   is I buy really expensive pickleball paddles.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.280]   - How much do they run, a really good one?
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.240]   - 250, $250.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   - Here's a question.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.320]   I've heard that many people who win the lottery
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.920]   lose it pretty quickly.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.000]   Why is that?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.360]   What is the best thing to do
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.200]   if you get a sudden windfall like that?
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.560]   Bill, how about you?
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   - Well, there's actually, I think that's urban folklore.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.040]   I think there is now accumulating peer-reviewed literature
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.800]   that says that people who win the lottery
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.280]   actually don't do badly.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.320]   Obviously, some are going to,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.560]   but they don't, they certainly,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.160]   the peer-reviewed literature doesn't really support that,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240]   which is too bad.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.800]   I mean, it's a great morality play
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.560]   to believe the urban folklore.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.280]   - I don't know how they would get that data.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.880]   I've heard other statistics that 25% of men on match.com
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.280]   are married, but I don't know how you get that data.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.440]   I've got some professional athletes as clients
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.400]   who earned a lot of money,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.120]   and they're not the norm.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   They're not the ones that typically blow it all immediately.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.400]   I think it's very hard to convince somebody
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.640]   that has always spent to start saving.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.840]   Catching up on FI is a wonderful tool.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.640]   - Mike, here's a question for you.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.200]   Are reverse rollovers of IRA to 401(k) recommended,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.000]   and maybe you can talk about what situations
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.160]   that that might be appropriate.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   - Sure.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.040]   Number one would be if we are looking
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.080]   to do a backdoor Roth,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   so the problem, so if you have income
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.720]   that is too high to make regular Roth IRA contributions,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.800]   and you can then contribute
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.000]   to a non-deductible traditional IRA,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.840]   you can make that contribution,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.440]   but if you then do a conversion,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.000]   that's why we call it a backdoor Roth
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.280]   is that you would convert it immediately,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   but if you do that,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.340]   when you have other traditional IRA balances,
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.320]   then you're gonna have to pay tax
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.000]   on most of that conversion anyway,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.880]   so what we could do is take your existing
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.080]   traditional IRA balances,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.360]   roll them into your 401(k),
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.240]   and then the new contribution,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.080]   you have to wait a year,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   but the new contribution to the traditional IRA,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.560]   the non-deductible contribution,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.960]   then that's the only money there,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.320]   so we can convert it right away,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.240]   not have to pay tax,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.000]   so that would be one reason.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.200]   There could be potentially other reasons.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.520]   You get creditor protection in the 401(k)
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.840]   that might not exist in an IRA.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.340]   It depends at the state level.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.080]   There could be better investment options in your 401(k).
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.920]   Every once in a while,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.240]   you do actually see some things that don't exist.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.100]   That's kind of backwards of what is usually the case,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.600]   but sometimes, so there are some reasons.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.400]   It's not something that you do usually, but yes.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.080]   - I do wanna just pick up on something Mike said,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   and that is creditor protection,
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.840]   and this is state by state.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.280]   There are some states where you have
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.640]   just the same creditor protection in your IRAs and Roth
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.380]   that you do in your qualified plan,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.640]   like a 401(k) or 403(b),
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.180]   where creditors cannot attach to it,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.440]   so there are a lot of states
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.480]   that you get the same creditor protection,
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.120]   but there are some states that you're in,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.680]   and if you have money in an IRA,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   they might give you maybe the first 50 or 60,000 of that
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.400]   that you can keep, and the rest of it is open to creditors,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.240]   so it depends on which state you live in.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.360]   There's a website that I go to.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.000]   I don't know how updated it is, but I look at it,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.920]   and it's just creditor protection by state website,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.480]   and you could look and see your particular state.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.700]   I mean, there are some states that are horrible.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.320]   I mean, I don't think I'd have any money in an IRA,
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.080]   but there are some states where it doesn't matter
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.800]   whether you have it in the IRA or the 401(k),
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.080]   so you really gotta look into that for your state.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.480]   - It depends on a lot of things,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.360]   but if I had access to the Government Thrift Savings Plan,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.640]   boy, would I roll my IRAs into
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.940]   that incredibly good 401(k) type of savings plan.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.080]   - Rick, just a quick follow-up for you
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.880]   on that earlier point about rebalancing being overrated.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.280]   The question is, can you elaborate on that?
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.480]   - Yeah, so I was talking basically
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.440]   about the financial advisor community
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.880]   who is looking for a reason to collect fees, you know?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.360]   We charge you 1%, and what do you do for that?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   Well, we come up with the optimal portfolio,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.540]   which of course is impossible to do,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.000]   and then we're also going to rebalance
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   your portfolio frequently because they show you
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.360]   some chart that shows if you rebalance every quarter
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.600]   that you're going to get some sort of an excess return,
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.360]   and it's really inflated.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   So as I think Alan said it correctly,
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.760]   he said basically, you know, when the market's down,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.040]   you probably want to rebalance,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   and when the market's way up,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.680]   you probably want to rebalance.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.020]   However, I'll caveat that with,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.040]   if you're going to have to sell stock in a taxable account
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.920]   and you have no place,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   and you're going to have to take a gain
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.400]   because all of your retirement money
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.080]   is in bonds already, and your Roth money,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.360]   you don't want to sell stock
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.080]   because, I mean, that's going to go to the kids,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.640]   you want it to grow tax-free.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.160]   So now you're left with, well,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.120]   in order to keep my allocation 60/40
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.240]   between stocks and bonds,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   I have to sell stock in my taxable account,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.240]   and it's going to generate gains.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.760]   My answer would be,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.880]   just do what's called a reverse glide path.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.040]   I mean, don't worry about selling stock
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.280]   in your taxable account,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.080]   unless you can do it at a very low tax rate.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.000]   Maybe, Alan, maybe you want to comment on that.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.920]   - Yeah, there are a lot of moving pieces here,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.120]   and Rick just touched on one of them,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.040]   namely that you certainly don't want to be doing
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.040]   rebalancing selling in a taxable account.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   That would completely more than wipe out
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.880]   by an order of magnitude any rebalancing bonus.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.120]   And, of course, it's a risky process as well.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.160]   I mean, there are places, there are asset class pairs
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.920]   that you certainly wouldn't want to be rebalancing
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.920]   U.S. versus Japanese stocks,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.960]   for example, for the past 40 years.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.880]   I think that the benefit of rebalancing
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.400]   is not financial, it's psychological.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   It gets you used to buying low and selling high.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.000]   It keeps you in financial condition,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.320]   and I put that in quotes,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.000]   the condition being that it basically
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.080]   builds up your discipline,
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.560]   and it's a muscle that you need to be using
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.200]   from time to time to be able to act properly.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.320]   - I've got a bit of a differing opinion.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.280]   Asset allocation comes first.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.720]   Asset location comes second.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.920]   So if you're out of your investment policy,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.960]   and you have no room to sell stocks
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   in the tax-deferred or tax-free accounts,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.720]   don't let the taxes wag your asset allocation.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.240]   Go ahead and pay the taxes.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   Now, I mean, use common sense.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.440]   If today it's a short-term gain,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.320]   and tomorrow it's a long-term gain,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.600]   I'd wait that day.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.960]   But it's just like you don't move somewhere
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.120]   because there's no state tax.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.000]   You don't pick an asset allocation
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.040]   to minimize the taxes.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.280]   You want to maximize the probability
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.360]   that you can do what you want
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.720]   for the rest of your lives.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.880]   - So here's a question I'd like each of you to tackle.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.000]   What has been your biggest change of heart
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   since you first started investing?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.400]   Rick, let's start with you.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.760]   - You know, we're talking like way back
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.160]   when I bought Dolly prints that were fake.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   I'd say, okay, let's move forward then.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.720]   Or buying that timeshare that I had to give up.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.360]   No, okay, my biggest change of heart
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.800]   has been moving from complexity to simplicity
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   in a portfolio.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.000]   I mean, you know, I listened to John Bogle
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.080]   and I had the epiphany of indexing back in 1996.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.760]   I fell in love with the idea that it was great.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.240]   But then I got a kind of overly wrapped up
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.600]   in the slicing and dicing of it all.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.960]   And, well, we could have, again, small cap value.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   We could have international small cap value.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.720]   Let's split Europe and Pacific.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.680]   And, you know, it got to be this indexing,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   was all indexing, but it was all,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.200]   it got to be an overly complex portfolio.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.600]   And then I had a second epiphany, which I call simplicity.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.440]   Which means, you know, getting back to Jack Bogle,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   he was right, and the three fund portfolio works.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.240]   And you really don't need much more.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.520]   And so my second epiphany with this was simplicity.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.760]   - Similar answer in that I think that's kind of
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.720]   a normal progression for a Bogle head,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.320]   is that you get into it, especially if it's a Bogle head
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.520]   who's hanging out on the forum, you can't help.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.600]   I mean, you're bombarded with this information
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.280]   about I could do this or I could do that.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.760]   And so you kind of dig into it a little bit.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.560]   And it looks promising, which is not to say
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   that any of these various things you could do
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.720]   with your asset allocation are a bad idea.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.240]   But recognizing that this is not the most important thing.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.480]   And investing, we can keep it simple.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.080]   And that's beneficial 'cause it makes us
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.320]   less likely to make investing mistakes.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.640]   But it's also beneficial because it frees up our time
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.280]   to, I mean, just deal with any other thing
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.400]   you want to do in your life.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.000]   But also just within the financial planning picture, right?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.680]   Like, you can keep the investing part simple,
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.520]   the tax part's never gonna be that simple.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.040]   Estate planning's not necessarily gonna be very simple.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.760]   So if you can keep one piece of it simple
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.200]   and that frees up your time and energy
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.280]   to tackle all the other parts, that's great.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.280]   - I've changed my view on safe spin rates.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.100]   A bit of a pessimist, I would say,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.600]   25, 30 year safe spin rate a few years ago
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.120]   was about 3% increasing with inflation.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.600]   I even wrote a piece, why I disagreed with Morningstar's
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.680]   safe spin rates study, and two conferences ago,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.280]   I apologized 'cause I no longer disagree.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.480]   Suddenly, real interest rates shot up
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.340]   from minus 1% to over 2%,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.640]   and that changed everything dramatically.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.560]   And I agree with Morningstar's safe spin rates.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.280]   - Yeah, two things that I've changed my mind about.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.600]   One is a long-term concept,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.960]   which is thinking about the riskiness of stocks.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.320]   And I've come to realize over the decades
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   that that's the wrong question unless you ask for whom.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.080]   If you're a young person, stocks aren't all that risky
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.440]   because you're deploying a constant stream of savings,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.760]   and eventually you're going to hit the jackpot
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.640]   in terms of buying low.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.320]   The second thing I've been turned around about,
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.560]   and I really owe this to Jim Dolley.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.880]   I used to think that real estate investing
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.360]   was three-mile island toxic you should stay away from.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.640]   It wasn't an investment, it was a job.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.720]   And I like to say that if you liked dealing
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   with fixing toilets and drug-addled tenants,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   then go for it.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   But Jim did turn me around on that a little bit.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.400]   So if you know what you're doing
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.840]   for a small subset of people,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.960]   it's probably inappropriate activity,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.080]   maybe 5% or 10% of people.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.360]   I got a very interesting email from someone
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.120]   who was actually going to become a finance professional,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.920]   and he thanked me for writing my books
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.160]   and convincing him that there was no way in the world
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.680]   he was going to be able to successfully pick stocks
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.160]   because he was competing against people
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.320]   with vast databases, IQs of 160,
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.200]   who were working 90 hours a week.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   But it was possible to make a good living
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.760]   dealing in real estate because there he was
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.520]   dealing with dentists from Lubbock.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.760]   And so he knew who was on the other side of his trades
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.160]   and he could pick those trades.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.600]   I thought that was a fairly profound observation.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.440]   - Mike, here's a question for you.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.600]   Can you please talk about mega backdoor IRA conversions?
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.720]   We just found out my husband's 401(k) plan allows these,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.600]   I guess an after-tax 401(k),
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.880]   but it was never advertised as a benefit.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.720]   Can you talk about what that is?
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.560]   - Yeah, so the mega backdoor Roth
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.880]   is a backdoor Roth that happens in a 401(k)
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.520]   instead of an IRA.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.280]   So we have our regular, with a 401(k)
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.960]   we've got our regular deferrals, right,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.120]   which you can make as pre-tax or Roth,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.320]   and that's up to you.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.600]   And then catch-up contributions,
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.320]   potentially, depending on your age.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.720]   And then there's another type of contribution
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.600]   that the tax law allows you to make
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.280]   that your plan might allow you to make
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.120]   or might not allow you to make.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.960]   And just like the person who wrote in
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.080]   with this question said,
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.400]   they don't often advertise it.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.640]   In many cases, you are allowed
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.240]   to make this type of contribution,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.680]   but they just don't tell you.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.000]   And this is called an after-tax contribution.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.040]   And so it's after-tax
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.640]   because you don't get a deduction for it.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.000]   So it's a non-deductible contribution to your 401(k).
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.920]   And the contribution limit is much higher.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.560]   I actually don't, I never memorized any of the limits.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.720]   - It's like 65,000, I think, all in.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.040]   - Okay.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.880]   - Okay.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.160]   - Thank you.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.560]   So much higher contribution limit
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.080]   than the regular, even including catch-up.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   And so you can put all this money in,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.480]   you don't get a deduction for it,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.400]   but the mega backdoor Roth part of it
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.040]   is that then you're allowed to convert it immediately
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.160]   if, again, if your plan allows for one of two things.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.360]   Number one is an in-plan conversion,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.000]   which means that immediately after putting
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.640]   that after-tax non-deductible money in,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.680]   you move it right over into the Roth 401(k)
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.160]   side of the plan, and it's not taxable.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.280]   So you basically just got to make
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.720]   a enormous Roth 401(k) contribution
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.160]   way beyond the normal limit, with no downside particularly.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.120]   The other thing that the,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.840]   so sometimes the plan doesn't allow for that,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   but it will allow for you to roll that portion,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.600]   and only that portion, over into a Roth IRA.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.680]   So sometimes that's allowed, and again,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.360]   it just depends on your plan document.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.920]   And so the idea is you're just able to make
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.480]   much larger Roth contributions through a 401(k)
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.040]   than you would normally be able to.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.360]   - So a 401(k), you can contribute currently,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.920]   the total amount that can go into a 401(k) is 69,000,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.120]   and if you're over the age of 50,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   I believe it's 76,000, okay.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.920]   So you're putting, if you're under the age of 50,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.720]   you're putting your 23,000 in as an employee,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.560]   and then there's this bucket that's left
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.040]   that goes all the way up to 69.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.440]   However, if your employer is putting money in,
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.200]   that uses up some of that bucket.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.160]   So what's left, if you're able,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.280]   is the amount that you could do this mega-backdoor Roth.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.760]   I'll also say that if you're self-employed,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.960]   you can do this with a solo 401(k),
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.240]   but you need a special type of solo 401(k),
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.680]   and Harry Sitt wrote a fantastic article
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   that I refer to all the time.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.840]   You can look it up,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.120]   Harry Sitt's solo 401(k) mega-backdoor Roth,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.800]   Google that, where he talks about as a solo,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.240]   self-employed, if you open up a solo 401(k)
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.840]   with a kind of a custom firm,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.120]   you could also do this mega-backdoor Roth.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.240]   But generally, if you're just doing a prototype plan
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   with like a censure, or fidelity, or Schwab,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.480]   you can't do it.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.840]   So it takes a custom plan.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.200]   - It's one of those laws that's too good to be true,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.160]   but it is true.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.400]   If you have that option, seriously look at it.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.800]   - I have a question, actually,
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.840]   that I'd like to direct to the three of you about this,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.320]   'cause this really is my area of expertise,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.640]   which is, to the extent that you wanna prioritize
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.440]   charitable giving, and you are worried
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.480]   about long-term care expenses,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.200]   should you be careful about Rothifying too much?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.200]   - Should you be, in other words,
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.000]   concerned about using up all of your traditional IRAs,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.160]   which you can basically pass tax-free
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   to whatever charities you want at death,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.640]   or to be able to use your traditional IRAs,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.680]   that you're gonna get at least a partial deduction for
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.560]   if your long-term care expenses are high.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.040]   - Well, the mega-backdoor Roth is using after-tax dollars
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.200]   to convert to pre-tax, convert to tax-free dollars.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.480]   I think that's hard to go wrong.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.920]   Could the government come up with laws to prove me wrong?
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.760]   Absolutely.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.200]   - Well, Bill, as far as I'm understanding your point,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   though, is the long-term care costs
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.360]   are oftentimes quite deductible,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.040]   and so the traditional IRA can be a really elegant,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.440]   traditional pre-tax account can be an elegant asset
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.720]   to use to address those expenses.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.840]   Is that what you're thinking about?
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.120]   - Precisely, and that goes double for charitable giving.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.720]   If you give money out of your traditional IRA,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.320]   that money has never gotten taxed at any point.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.680]   - Yeah. - 'Cause if you Rothify,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.360]   you've paid taxes on it.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   - With the charitable giving side of things,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.680]   yes, it is very helpful to maintain,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.960]   if you have charitable intent,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.360]   to maintain some traditional IRA dollars,
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.800]   because charitable giving basically lets you
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.280]   turn a traditional IRA into an HSA
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.440]   in the sense that you got a deduction
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.000]   when the money went in, it grows tax-free,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.640]   and then it comes out tax-free also,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.680]   so that's a fantastic deal.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.760]   And so, yeah, if you have charitable intent,
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.560]   eliminating your tax-deferred balances is not a good idea.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.080]   Save some money for that purpose.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.480]   I think it's a little different
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.920]   for the long-term care side of things.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   The long-term care costs, if they are deductible,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.800]   then, yes, in those years,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.840]   that can be bringing your taxable income down
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.720]   and letting you pull the money out of the traditional IRA
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.840]   at perhaps not a very high tax rate,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.040]   but I struggle with explaining this.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.960]   The deduction you get, it's fungible
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.240]   in the way that the money is fungible.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.800]   You're gonna get that deduction
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.960]   even if you aren't pulling the money out of traditional,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.280]   like, the deduction is because of the healthcare expense,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.960]   not because you're taking money out of the traditional IRA,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.640]   and so that deduction would be available
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.320]   to save money on other things
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.560]   regardless of where the money's coming from.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.200]   So I think saving money in a traditional IRA
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.800]   or other tax-deferred place
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   for charitable giving down the line makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.640]   I don't think that's the case for the long-term care thing,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.400]   although it is true that if you are going to be having
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.480]   significantly deductible long-term care expenses,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.800]   yes, that is gonna be some tax savings.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.880]   - But I agree with you, Bill.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.840]   Tax diversification is important.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.080]   And having some taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.160]   because we never know what life brings us,
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.240]   and we really never know
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.600]   what politicians are gonna bring us.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   - Here's a question just following up on long-term care.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.000]   What is a basic strategy for financing long-term care?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.480]   So assuming someone doesn't have insurance,
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.840]   and they're setting aside funds,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.800]   presumably for long-term care,
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.360]   where, how invested, maybe even how large?
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.800]   Can you all talk about that?
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.160]   - Well, we guys don't live very long in long-term care.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.760]   Women, you've got the bigger problem.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.160]   You live a lot longer.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.280]   You know, with most of my clients and for myself,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.640]   we self-insure.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.720]   I think if you don't have much in the way of savings,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.880]   you're probably going to be in a Medicaid place.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.040]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.440]   You can buy long-term care insurance,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   but you can, a temporary policy,
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.280]   or pure long-term care,
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.320]   rates have increased incredibly,
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.200]   and that's just too much risk, in my opinion,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   and a permanent long-term care policy
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.680]   is mixed with a permanent insurance,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   whether it's whole life, or universal,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.200]   or something like that, is very expensive.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   My clients tend to be very wealthy, so we self-insure.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.400]   - You also have your home.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.240]   Generally, the first person who goes into,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.400]   if they have to go into assisted living or a nursing home,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.160]   a lot of that could be self-funded,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.200]   at least from a lot of the people
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.600]   who might have a couple million or more,
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.360]   you self-fund that portion of it,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.200]   but you do have your home.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   You have the equity in your home.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.760]   By this time, a lot of homes are paid off,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.680]   so you could do a reverse mortgage.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.720]   I don't know if we got a chance to talk that much about it,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.320]   but they actually are useful for some people
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.080]   because you don't have to sell the home,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.880]   and therefore, the equity in the home,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.440]   if both spouses die, gets a step up on debt,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.320]   so you could borrow from the house
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   to fund the long-term care for one spouse or the other,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.640]   if needed, so that's another option you have,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.000]   or you could sell the house.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.840]   Take the gain.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.120]   You got $500,000 in gain for, if it's two people,
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.780]   filing jointly, 250,000 if it's a single person,
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.400]   after two years of death of the spouse,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.080]   so you have the equity in the home
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.160]   that can be used towards long-term care,
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.720]   and I think a lot of people use their home,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.000]   or could use their home,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.160]   as a long-term care insurance policy,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.360]   the equity in the home.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.880]   - The people who bought it 20 years ago
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.300]   probably got a pretty good deal
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.520]   before the insurance companies discovered how
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.640]   or figured out how to price it properly,
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.120]   but I think in 2024, if you need it, you can't afford it,
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.320]   and if you can afford it, you don't need it.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.540]   - It sounded to me, and maybe I was wrong,
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.640]   but maybe a part of that question was about
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.040]   if we are self-funding and setting aside,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.560]   either mentally or literally, a part of the portfolio
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.040]   for potential future long-term care costs,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.880]   how do we allocate it?
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.160]   And to me, that is a question that,
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.440]   I think it can be helpful to mentally set aside this money
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.240]   in the sense that we don't want to count on using it
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   for other spending, but as far as asset allocation,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.400]   I don't think there's a particularly useful way to say,
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.520]   oh, this money should be allocated that way,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.560]   because we don't know when it's going to happen.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.760]   If we knew when it would happen,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.440]   then we could pick some asset allocation
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.080]   that's a perfect match, or tips that mature
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.420]   in exactly that year, or whatever, but we don't know,
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.480]   so I don't think there's a need to segregate it out
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.000]   from an asset allocation point of view.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.340]   - And by the way, often, if the second spouse
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.880]   goes into long-term care, it's very expensive,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.440]   but you no longer have a house,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.140]   you no longer have a car, insurance, traveling,
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.560]   so there are some expenses that offset that.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.440]   I have a question for whoever wants to jump on it
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.960]   that's related, I have heard from other financial planners
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.360]   that when clients don't have any sort of
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.160]   long-term care insurance, that sometimes
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.760]   those are the ones who dramatically underspend
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.200]   what they could spend, because they are very nervous
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.400]   about these potential costs hanging out there.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.040]   What do you think about that, that even though
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   the financing aspects of insurance aren't great,
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.200]   that there's a kind of a peace of mind allocation there
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.040]   that could help someone live well
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.680]   in those years that they're well?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.260]   - Well, there's two sides of that.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.160]   You've got a very expensive premium
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.760]   that could be going up, which might cause you
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.480]   to spend less as well, but it's like any insurance,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.840]   the insurance company expects to make money from it,
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.940]   so your expected return is negative.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.240]   Absolutely, if it makes you feel better,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.120]   allows you to spend more, then yes, you should do it,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.800]   even though it may not be economically optimal.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.200]   - I will say for the young people in this room,
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.340]   okay, when you get to our age, not Mike,
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.120]   just have a lot of children, right?
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.040]   I mean, one of them will take you in.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.360]   Speaking of children, this question says,
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.080]   my son selected T. Rowe Price High Yield Bond Fund
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.280]   in his 401(k).
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.480]   He is 29 years old, so now he has 90% stock,
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.400]   Vanguard 500, and 10% junk bonds.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.800]   Please give info of pros and cons
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.220]   of high-yield bond funds, junk bonds.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.520]   - I did a talk on the language of investing,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   and the one term my industry got right
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.200]   are calling high-yield bonds junk bonds.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.480]   Don't buy junk, take your risks with stocks,
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.040]   have your fixed income be the most boring part
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.160]   of your portfolio.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.920]   - And I'll give you the other side of that.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.480]   Okay, so it is part of the bond market, right?
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.680]   High-yield, Vanguard has a wonderful
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.960]   high-yield corporate bond fund.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.200]   It's not C-rated, double C-rated.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.040]   It's double B, B double B.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.600]   And if you look at the risk and return of that portfolio,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.960]   it has actually done very well relative to the risk.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.840]   Now granted, Alan is right,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.560]   it does have higher correlation with economic risk.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.120]   So it does go down more than, say, a treasury bond fund
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.900]   when the economy goes down.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.840]   But if you're gonna have this portfolio,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.200]   if you're gonna add high-yield bonds to your portfolio,
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.780]   I think that Vanguard has probably one of the best
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.100]   high-yield corporate bond funds out there.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.500]   And there is a little bit of an inefficiency
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.220]   in where they're investing in the market
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.660]   because they're buying B-rated, double B-rated.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.140]   And so when something becomes a fallen angel
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.020]   and it drops from investment grade, which is triple B,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.620]   down to double B, you've got a much bigger pot of people,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.660]   a pot of portfolio managers who have to sell that bond.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.580]   You get an awful lot of selling going on.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.220]   And so it depresses the price.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.780]   Vanguard is buying double B-rated bonds.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.940]   They pick this bond up,
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.780]   and I think they actually get a premium for liquidity
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.060]   for being able to buy these bonds when that happens.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.200]   And I think this is one of the reasons
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.140]   why I think that fund has done well.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we're arguing
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.900]   angels on pinheads here.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.000]   How much extra juice do you get
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.420]   from the equity risk premium
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.660]   you're actually getting from junk bonds
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   versus you would actually getting from junk bonds?
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.060]   I mean, I used to play that game.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.520]   I used to wait for the spread to increase to 10 or 15%,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.860]   and then I would load up on junk bonds
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.940]   until I realized I would have done
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.540]   a whole lot better investing in stocks at that point.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.340]   - Okay, we are right on time here.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.540]   I think we are going to do this kind of
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.140]   ask us anything session at future conferences.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.980]   I've loved this.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.260]   We have a huge stack of things
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.420]   that we could have gotten to and didn't have time.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.820]   So many great questions.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.460]   We are going to have to leave it there.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.660]   Please join me in thanking Rick, Mike, Alan, and Bill.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.240]   - And Christine.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.660]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
