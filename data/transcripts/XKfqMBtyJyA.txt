[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.880]   - But just to start with a couple of questions from me,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.900]   most overrated issue in investing.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.040]   Let's start with the thing that you think
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.160]   people make way too much out of
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.460]   that at the end of the day doesn't matter a lot.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.320]   What is the question you get again and again
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   and kind of go, doesn't really matter.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.680]   - Is small cap value, can we include that in there?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.720]   - But if we weren't gonna go down that road,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.800]   I'd say rebalancing.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.080]   By the financial industry, a lot of advisors say,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760]   well, we rebalance your portfolio
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120]   and therefore we earn an extra 2% annualized return
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880]   by doing it, which is nonsense.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.940]   So I'd say that rebalancing is kind of overrated.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.240]   - Adam, rather, yesterday touched on this.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.960]   I have an analogy that I often use about asset allocation.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.080]   If you've ever baked a cake before,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.240]   then you know that you start with
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.200]   basically some dry white powdery stuff, right?
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.840]   Flour, sugar, salt, leavening, and some butter and eggs.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   And then when you mix them together
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   in exactly the right proportions,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.160]   cook it at exactly the right temperature
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080]   for exactly the right length of time, magic happens, right?
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   You go from butter, eggs, and powdery stuff to a cake.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.240]   But if you mess it up, if you get the proportions wrong,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.080]   the temperature wrong,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.400]   you leave out the leavening, whatever, it's a disaster.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.360]   And a lot of people will tell you
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.760]   that asset allocation is the same way, right?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   If you get the small cap value tilt exactly right,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.480]   if you use a 10% retail allocation,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.520]   or you make sure to use short-term treasury bonds
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   instead of a total bond fund, or whatever it is.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.520]   But asset allocation is not like baking a cake,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   it's like making a fruit salad, right?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.680]   If you just increase your blueberry allocation a little bit,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.840]   it's not a big deal, like there's no magic,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   it's no disaster, you just have more blueberries.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.640]   And that might be good, or it might be bad,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   but it's not a big deal.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   And if you go to the grocery store,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   and the raspberries and blackberries look kind of iffy,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   and so you end up with a three-ingredient fruit salad,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   that's fine.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.640]   - I'm gonna say I, is this on?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.440]   Yeah, I'm gonna say I actually agree with Rick.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   When to rebalance, and looking at history,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   you could see a whole lots of reasons when to do it,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   but I think as long as you rebalance,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.320]   as long as you buy when stocks are on sale,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.280]   and sell when they're high,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.400]   you're gonna get a boost of a return
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.580]   versus that average asset allocation.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.240]   - Yeah, I'm severely disadvantaged here two ways.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.320]   Number one is I'm the last to answer,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   so I agree with all three of these guys.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   And the second thing I've learned
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.240]   is to never match Sinalese with Mike Piper, so.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.200]   - We start on that side and go this way?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.480]   - Yeah.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.880]   - So Bill, this one's coming right at you.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.760]   You are all intelligent and great money managers.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.920]   How do you treat yourself or blow money?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.960]   Is it a trip, car, knowing you have plenty of money?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.080]   What is it, what's your splurge?
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.760]   - I just paid $100 extra to fly business class
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.480]   back to Portland, and that's, you know,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.880]   that's the first, that's almost as good
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.240]   as the threads you see on the board,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.700]   which, you know, can I buy my Rolex now?
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.280]   Am I, you know, will I go to hell
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   if I buy a Rolex to Boglehead L?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   - Do you pay for first class if you're going overseas?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200]   - That's a really good question.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   I haven't really faced that.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   I occasionally, we fly Iceland Air,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.360]   and you can bib on first class,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.720]   and sometimes I win and sometimes I lose.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.640]   - I have a dysfunctional relationship with money.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   And I even wrote about this.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   As an Uber saver, it's hard to start spending money,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.900]   and I've done a little research on that,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.840]   and I'm very proud.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.960]   We flew premium economy to Europe.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.400]   It's been two weeks there, and it cost $20,000,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.520]   and it's the first time I bragged
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.180]   about how much something costs.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   I'm usually bragging about the $1 tram ride
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.980]   from the airport to the hotel.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.580]   - I take a quick trip to Colorado Springs,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.900]   have breakfast with Alan Roth,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900]   and then spend a little bit of time climbing.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.140]   - So how do I splurge on money?
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   - On yourself.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.700]   What do you do? - I have a wife.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.740]   She, we did go to Europe last year,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.780]   and of course, I was all about the economy class,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.340]   even though I was gonna be in the middle in row 87,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.140]   and she was gonna be in the middle in row 76.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.140]   She said, "We're flying business class,"
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.380]   or, "I'm not going."
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.780]   So we flew business class, which was great, by the way.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.140]   And so we'll probably do that.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.440]   In fact, I know we're gonna do that.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.020]   If I ever wanna go to Europe again,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.380]   we're gonna be flying business class.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.340]   But the second thing I do for myself
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.580]   is I buy really expensive pickleball paddles.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.660]   - How much do they run?
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.340]   A really good one. - Oh, 250, $250.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.220]   - Here's a question.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.340]   I've heard that many people who win the lottery
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.940]   lose it pretty quickly.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.020]   Why is that?
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.380]   What is the best thing to do
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.220]   if you get a sudden windfall like that?
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.580]   Bill, how about you?
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.260]   - Well, there's actually, I think that's urban folklore.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.060]   I think there is now accumulating peer-reviewed literature
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.820]   that says that people who win the lottery
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.300]   actually don't do badly.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.300]   Obviously, some are going to,
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.860]   but they certainly, the peer-reviewed literature
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.260]   doesn't really support that, which is too bad.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.840]   I mean, it's a great morality play
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.580]   to believe the urban folklore.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.340]   - I don't know how they would get that data.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.860]   I've heard other statistics that 25% of men
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.500]   on match.com are married,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.220]   but I don't know how you get that data.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.460]   I've got some professional athletes as clients
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.420]   who earned a lot of money,
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.180]   and they're not the norm.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.180]   They're not the ones that typically blow it all immediately.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.460]   I think it's very hard to convince somebody
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.700]   that has always spent to start saving.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.900]   Catching up on FI is a wonderful tool.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.700]   - Mike, here's a question for you.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.260]   Are reverse rollovers of IRA to 401(k) recommended,
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.060]   and maybe you can talk about what situations
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.220]   that that might be appropriate.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.820]   - Sure.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.100]   Number one would be if we are looking
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.140]   to do a backdoor Roth.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.700]   So the problem, so if you have income
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.780]   that is too high to make regular Roth IRA contributions,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.860]   and you can then contribute
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.060]   to a non-deductible traditional IRA,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.880]   you can make that contribution,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.460]   but if you then do a conversion,
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   that's why we call it a backdoor Roth,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.300]   is that you would convert it immediately.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.420]   But if you do that,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.380]   when you have other traditional IRA balances,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   then you're gonna have to pay tax
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.020]   on most of that conversion anyway.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.340]   So what we could do is take
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.120]   your existing traditional IRA balances,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.380]   roll them into your 401(k),
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.260]   and then the new contribution,
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.100]   you have to wait a year,
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.380]   but the new contribution to the traditional IRA,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.580]   the non-deductible contribution,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.940]   then that's the only money there,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.220]   so we can convert it right away, not have to pay tax.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.980]   So that would be one reason.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.180]   There could be potentially other reasons.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.500]   You get creditor protection in the 401(k)
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.860]   that might not exist in an IRA,
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.180]   depends at the state level.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.100]   There could be better investment options in your 401(k).
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.940]   Every once in a while,
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.260]   you do actually see some things that don't exist.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.100]   That's kind of backwards of what is usually the case,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.280]   but sometimes.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.620]   So there are some reasons.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.420]   It's not something that you do usually, but yes.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.100]   - I do wanna just pick up on something Mike said,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.980]   and that is creditor protection,
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.860]   and this is state by state.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.300]   There are some states where you have
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.060]   just the same creditor protection
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.420]   in your IRAs and Roth that you do in your qualified plan,
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.660]   like a 401(k) or 403(b),
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.220]   where creditors cannot attach to it.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.460]   So there are a lot of states
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.500]   that you get the same creditor protection,
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.180]   but there are some states that you're in,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.720]   and if you have money in an IRA,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   they might give you maybe the first 50 or 60,000 of that
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.660]   that you can keep,
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.420]   and the rest of it is open to creditors.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.300]   So it depends on which state you live in.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.380]   There's a website that I go to.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.900]   I don't know how updated it is,
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.060]   but I look at it,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.940]   and it's just creditor protection by state website,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.500]   and you could look and see your particular state.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.740]   I mean, there are some states that are horrible.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.580]   I mean, I wouldn't,
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.340]   I don't think I'd have any money in an IRA,
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.100]   but there are some states where it doesn't matter
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.100]   whether you have it in the IRA or the 401(k).
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.100]   So you really gotta look into that for your state.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.520]   - It depends on a lot of things,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.420]   but if I had access to the government thrift savings plan,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   boy, would I roll my IRAs
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.980]   into that incredibly good 401(k) type of savings plan.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.100]   - Rick, just a quick follow-up for you
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.920]   on that earlier point about rebalancing being overrated.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.360]   The question is, can you elaborate on that?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.500]   - Yeah, so I was talking basically
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.460]   about the financial advisor community
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.320]   who is looking for a reason to collect fees.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.380]   We charge you 1%, and what do you do for that?
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.400]   Well, we come up with the optimal portfolio,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.580]   which of course is impossible to do.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.840]   And then we're also going
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.420]   to rebalance your portfolio frequently
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.700]   because they show you some chart
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.380]   that shows if you rebalance every quarter
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.640]   that you're going to get some sort of an excess return,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.380]   and it's really inflated.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.380]   So I think Alan said it correctly.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.780]   He said basically when the market's down,
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.100]   you probably wanna rebalance,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.460]   and when the market's way up,
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.700]   you probably wanna rebalance.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.060]   However, I'll caveat that with,
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.060]   if you're gonna have to sell stock in a taxable account,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.940]   and you have no place,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.940]   and you're gonna have to take a gain
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.940]   because all of your retirement money is in bonds already,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.420]   and your Roth money, you don't wanna sell stock
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.140]   because that's gonna go to the kids
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.700]   who want it to grow tax-free.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.140]   So now you're left with,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.100]   in order to keep my allocation 60/40
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.260]   between stocks and bonds,
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.340]   I have to sell stock in my taxable account,
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.220]   and it's gonna generate gains.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.780]   My answer would be,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.900]   just do what's called a reverse glide path.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.020]   I mean, don't worry about selling stock
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.300]   in your taxable account,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.100]   unless you can do it at a very low tax rate.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.020]   Maybe Alan, maybe you wanna comment on that.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.940]   - Yeah, there are a lot of moving pieces here,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.140]   and Rick just touched on one of them,
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.060]   namely that you certainly don't wanna be doing
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.060]   rebalancing selling in a taxable account.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.100]   That would completely more than wipe out
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.900]   by an order of magnitude any rebalancing bonus.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.180]   And of course, it's a risky process as well.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.380]   I mean, there are places,
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.180]   there are asset class pairs
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.940]   that you certainly wouldn't wanna be rebalancing
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.940]   US versus Japanese stocks,
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.020]   for example, for the past 40 years.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.100]   I think that the benefit of rebalancing is not financial.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.460]   It's psychological.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   It gets you used to buying low and selling high.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.060]   It keeps you in financial condition,
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.380]   and I put that in quotes,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.020]   the condition being that it basically
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.140]   builds up your discipline,
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.580]   and it's a muscle that you need to be using
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.220]   from time to time to be able to act properly.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.340]   - I've got a bit of a differing opinion.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.340]   Asset allocation comes first.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.780]   Asset location comes second.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.980]   So if you're out of your investment policy,
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.060]   and you have no room to sell stocks
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.380]   in the tax-deferred or tax-free accounts,
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.820]   don't let the taxes wag your asset allocation.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.340]   Go ahead and pay the taxes.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.020]   Now, I mean, use common sense.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.540]   If today it's a short-term gain,
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.420]   and tomorrow it's a long-term gain,
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.700]   I'd wait that day.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.020]   But just like you don't move somewhere
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.220]   because there's no state tax,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.140]   you don't pick an asset allocation to minimize the taxes.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.380]   You wanna maximize the probability
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.460]   that you can do what you want
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.820]   for the rest of your lives.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.300]   - So here's a question
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.980]   I'd like each of you to tackle.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.060]   What has been your biggest change of heart
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.140]   since you first started investing?
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.540]   Rick, let's start with you.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.860]   - You know, we're talking like way back
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.260]   when I bought Dolly prints that were fake.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.540]   I'd say, okay, let's go forward then.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.660]   Or buying that timeshare that I had to give up.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.820]   No, okay.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.100]   My biggest change of heart has been
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.340]   moving from complexity to simplicity in a portfolio.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.940]   I mean, you know, I listened to John Bogle
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.020]   and I had the epiphany of indexing back in 1996.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.700]   I fell in love with the idea that it was great.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.220]   But then I got a kind of overly wrapped up
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.580]   in the slicing and dicing of it all.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.980]   And well, we could have, again, small gap value.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.780]   We could have international small gap value.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.340]   Let's split Europe and Pacific and, you know.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.580]   It got to be this indexing, it was all indexing,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.220]   but it was all, it got to be an overly complex portfolio.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.620]   And then I had a second epiphany, which I call simplicity.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.420]   Which means, you know, getting back to Jack Bogle,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.500]   he was right, and the three fund portfolio works.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.220]   And you really don't need much more.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.500]   And so my second epiphany with this was simplicity.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.780]   - Similar answer, in that I think that's kind of
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.700]   a normal progression for a Bogle head,
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.300]   is that you get into it, especially if it's a Bogle head
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.500]   who's hanging out on the forum, you can't help.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.580]   I mean, you're bombarded with this information
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.260]   about I could do this or I could do that.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.740]   And so you kind of dig into it a little bit.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.540]   And it looks promising, which is not to say
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.540]   that any of these various things you could do
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.740]   with your asset allocation are a bad idea.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.260]   But recognizing that this is not the most important thing.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.500]   And investing, we can keep it simple,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.700]   and that's beneficial 'cause it makes us less likely
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.420]   to make investing mistakes, but it's also beneficial
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.380]   because it frees up our time to, I mean,
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.420]   just deal with any other thing you want to do in your life.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.020]   But also just within the financial planning picture, right?
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.660]   Like, you can keep the investing part simple,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.500]   the tax part's never gonna be that simple.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.060]   Estate planning's not necessarily gonna be very simple.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.780]   So if you can keep one piece of it simple
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.220]   and that frees up your time and energy
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.300]   to tackle all the other parts, that's great.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.280]   - I've changed my view on safe spin rates.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.100]   A bit of a pessimist, I would say,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.580]   25, 30 year safe spin rate a few years ago
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.140]   was about 3% increasing with inflation.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.320]   I even wrote a piece why I disagreed
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.980]   with Morningstar's safe spin rates study.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.620]   And two conferences ago, I apologized
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.260]   'cause I no longer disagree.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.460]   Suddenly, real interest rates shot up
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   from minus 1% to over 2%,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.620]   and that changed everything dramatically.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.580]   And I agree with Morningstar's safe spin rates.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.260]   - Yeah, two things that I've changed my mind about.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.600]   One is a long-term concept,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.940]   which is thinking about the riskiness of stocks.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.300]   And I've come to realize over the decades
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.340]   that the correct, that's the wrong question,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.540]   unless you ask for whom, all right?
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.100]   If you're a young person, stocks aren't all that risky
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.460]   because you're deploying a constant stream of savings,
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.780]   and eventually, you're going to hit the jackpot
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.660]   in terms of buying low.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.360]   The second thing I've been turned around about,
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.600]   and I really owe this to Jim Dolley.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.660]   I used to think that real estate investing
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.380]   was Three Mile Island toxic, you should stay away from.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.660]   It wasn't an investment, it was a job.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.740]   And I like to say that if you like dealing
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   with fixing toilets and drug-addled tenants,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.240]   then go for it.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.100]   But Jim did turn me around on that a little bit.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.440]   So if you know what you're doing
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.860]   for a small subset of people,
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.980]   it's probably an appropriate activity,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.140]   maybe 5% or 10% of people.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.380]   I got a very interesting email from someone
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.180]   who was actually going to become a finance professional,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.940]   and he thanked me for writing my books
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.060]   and convincing him that there was no way in the world
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.700]   he was going to be able to successfully pick stocks
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.220]   because he was competing against people
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.380]   with vast databases, IQs of 160,
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.260]   who were working 90 hours a week.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.660]   But it was possible to make a good living
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.300]   dealing in real estate because there,
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.500]   he was dealing with dentists from Lubbock.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.780]   And so he knew who was on the other side of his trades
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.180]   and he could pick those trades.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.620]   I thought that was a fairly profound observation.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.500]   - Mike, here's a question for you.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.620]   Can you please talk about mega backdoor IRA conversions?
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.740]   We just found out my husband's 401(k) plan allows these,
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.640]   I guess an after-tax 401(k),
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.900]   but it was never advertised as a benefit.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.780]   Can you talk about what that is?
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.580]   - Yeah, so the mega backdoor Roth
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.940]   is a backdoor Roth that happens in a 401(k)
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.540]   instead of an IRA.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.300]   So we have our regular, with a 401(k),
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.980]   we've got our regular deferrals, right?
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.180]   Which you can make as pre-tax or Roth,
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.380]   and that's up to you.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.660]   And then catch-up contributions,
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.360]   potentially, depending on your age.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.740]   And then there's another type of contribution
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.620]   that the tax law allows you to make
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.320]   that your plan might allow you to make
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.140]   or might not allow you to make.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.980]   And just like the person who wrote in
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.100]   with this question said,
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.420]   they don't often advertise it.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.660]   In many cases, you are allowed
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.220]   to make this type of contribution,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.700]   but they just don't tell you.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.980]   And this is called an after-tax contribution.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.180]   And so it's after-tax because
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.660]   you don't get a deduction for it.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.220]   So it's a non-deductible contribution
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.020]   to your 401(k).
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.940]   And the contribution limit is much higher.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.660]   I actually don't, I never memorize any of the limits.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.580]   - It's like 65,000, I think, all in.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.060]   - Okay.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.900]   - Okay.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.180]   - Thank you.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.580]   So much higher contribution limit
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.080]   than the regular, even including catch-up.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.100]   And so you can put all this money in,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.500]   you don't get a deduction for it,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.380]   but the mega backdoor Roth part of it
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.020]   is that then you're allowed to convert it immediately
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.140]   if, again, if your plan allows for one of two things.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.340]   Number one is an in-plan conversion,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.000]   which means that immediately after putting
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.620]   that after-tax non-deductible money in,
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.900]   you move it right over into the Roth 401(k) side
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.160]   of the plan, and it's not taxable.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.300]   So you basically just got to make
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.740]   an enormous Roth 401(k) contribution
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.940]   way beyond the normal limit,
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.180]   with no downside particularly.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.960]   The other thing that, so sometimes the plan
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.660]   doesn't allow for that, but it will allow
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.620]   for you to roll that portion,
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.620]   and only that portion, over into a Roth IRA.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.660]   So sometimes that's allowed, and again,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.340]   it just depends on your plan document.
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.900]   And so the idea is you're just able to make
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.460]   much larger Roth contributions through a 401(k)
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.060]   than you would normally be able to.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.380]   - So a 401(k), you can contribute currently,
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.540]   the total amount that you can go into a 401(k)
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.100]   is 69,000, and if you're over the age of 50,
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   I believe it's 76,000, okay.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.900]   So you're putting, if you're under the age of 50,
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.720]   you're putting your 23,000 in as an employee,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.540]   and then there's this bucket that's left
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.020]   that goes all the way up to 69.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.460]   However, if your employer is putting money in,
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.220]   that uses up some of that bucket.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.180]   So what's left, if you're able,
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.260]   is the amount that you could do this mega-backdoor Roth.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.720]   I'll also say that if you're self-employed,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.940]   you can do this with a solo 401(k),
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.260]   but you need a special type of solo 401(k),
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.680]   and Harry Sitt wrote a fantastic article
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.900]   that I refer to all the time.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.740]   You can look it up,
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.620]   Harry Sitt's Solo 401(k) Mega-Backdoor Roth,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.220]   you know, Google that,
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.020]   where he talks about, as a solo self-employed,
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.260]   if you open up a solo 401(k)
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.860]   with a kind of a custom firm,
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.140]   you could also do this mega-backdoor Roth.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.280]   But generally, if you're just doing a prototype plan
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   with like a censure or fidelity or Schwab,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.700]   you can't do it, so it takes a custom plan.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.220]   - It's one of those laws that's too good to be true,
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.180]   but it is true.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.420]   If you have that option, seriously look at it.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.780]   - I have a question, actually,
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.820]   that I'd like to direct to the three of you about this,
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.340]   'cause this really is my area of expertise,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.620]   which is, to the extent that you wanna prioritize
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.420]   charitable giving, and you are worried
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.460]   about long-term care expenses,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.180]   should you be careful about Rothifying too much?
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.220]   In other words, concerned about using up
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.020]   all of your traditional IRAs,
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.180]   which you can basically pass tax-free
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.420]   to whatever charities you want at death,
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.740]   or, to be able to use your traditional IRAs,
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.420]   that you're gonna get at least a partial deduction
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.580]   for if your long-term care expenses are high.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.060]   - Well, the mega-backdoor Roth is using after-tax dollars
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.180]   to convert to tax-free dollars.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.500]   I think that's hard to go wrong.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.900]   Could the government come up with laws to prove me wrong?
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.740]   Absolutely.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.400]   - Well, Bill, as far as I'm understanding your point, though,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   the long-term care costs are oftentimes quite deductible,
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.980]   and so the traditional IRA can be a really elegant,
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.460]   or traditional pre-tax account can be an elegant asset
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.760]   to use to address those expenses.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.860]   Is that what you're thinking about?
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.140]   - Precisely, and that goes double for charitable giving.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.780]   If you give money out of your traditional IRA,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.800]   that money has never gotten taxed at any point.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.100]   If you Rothify, you've paid taxes on it.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.080]   - With the charitable giving side of things,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.720]   yes, it is very helpful to maintain,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.980]   if you have charitable intent,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.400]   to maintain some traditional IRA dollars,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.840]   because charitable giving basically lets you
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.320]   turn a traditional IRA into an HSA,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.480]   in the sense that you got a deduction
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.040]   when the money went in, it grows tax-free,
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.720]   and then it comes out tax-free also,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.740]   so that's a fantastic deal.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.880]   And so, yeah, if you have charitable intent,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.680]   eliminating your tax-deferred balances is not a good idea.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   Save some money for that purpose.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.560]   I think it's a little different
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.800]   for the long-term care side of things.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.000]   The long-term care costs, if they are deductible,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.920]   then yes, in those years,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   that can be bringing your taxable income down
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.800]   and letting you pull the money out of the traditional IRA
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.920]   at perhaps not a very high tax rate,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.120]   but I struggle with explaining this.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.020]   The deduction you get, it's fungible
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.300]   in the way that the money is fungible.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.860]   You're gonna get that deduction
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.020]   even if you aren't pulling the money out of traditional,
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.300]   like, the deduction is because of the healthcare expense,
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.020]   not because you're taking money out of the traditional IRA,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.700]   and so that deduction would be available
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.380]   to save money on other things,
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.460]   regardless of where the money's coming from.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.240]   So I think saving money in a traditional IRA
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.800]   or other tax-deferred place for charitable giving
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.400]   down the line makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.680]   I don't think that's the case for the long-term care thing,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.440]   although it is true that if you are going to be having
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.540]   significantly deductible long-term care expenses,
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.840]   yes, that is gonna be some tax savings.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.940]   - But I agree with you, Bill.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.880]   Tax diversification is important,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.040]   having some taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.120]   because we never know what life brings us,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.120]   and we really never know what politicians
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.580]   are gonna bring us.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.680]   - Here's a question just following up on long-term care.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.980]   What is a basic strategy for financing long-term care?
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.460]   So assuming someone doesn't have insurance,
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.460]   and they're setting aside funds, presumably,
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.100]   for long-term care, where, how invested,
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.340]   maybe even how large?
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.740]   Can you all talk about that?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.160]   - Well, we guys don't live very long in long-term care.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.760]   Women, you've got the bigger problem.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.140]   You live a lot longer.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.280]   You know, with most of my clients and for myself,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.620]   we self-insure.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.720]   I think if you don't have much in the way of savings,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.880]   you're probably going to be in a Medicaid place.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.040]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.460]   You can buy long-term care insurance,
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.480]   but you can, a temporary policy,
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.320]   or pure long-term care, rates have increased incredibly,
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.220]   and that's just too much risk, in my opinion,
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.240]   and a permanent long-term care policy
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.720]   is mixed with a permanent insurance,
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.540]   whether it's whole life or universal
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.220]   or something like that, is very expensive.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.820]   My clients tend to be very wealthy, so we self-insure.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.420]   - You also have your home.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.260]   Generally, the first person who goes into,
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.860]   if they have to go into assisted living
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.180]   or a nursing home, a lot of that could be self-funded,
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.220]   at least from a lot of the people
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.620]   who might have a couple million or more,
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.380]   you self-fund that portion of it,
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.220]   but you do have your home.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.220]   You have the equity in your home.
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.780]   By this time, a lot of homes are paid off,
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.620]   so you could do a reverse mortgage.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.740]   I don't know if we got a chance to talk that much about it,
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.340]   but they actually are useful for some people
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.100]   because you don't have to sell the home,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.880]   and therefore, the equity in the home,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.460]   if both spouses die, gets to step up on debt,
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.340]   so you could borrow from the house
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.340]   to fund the long-term care for one spouse or the other
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.660]   if needed, so that's another option you have,
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.020]   or you could sell the house.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.860]   Take the gain.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.160]   You got $500,000 in gain for if it's two people
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.820]   filing jointly, 250,000 if it's a single person
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.420]   after two years of death of the spouse,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.100]   so you have the equity in the home
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.180]   that can be used towards long-term care,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.780]   and I think a lot of people use their home
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.180]   could use their home as a long-term care insurance policy,
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.340]   the equity in the home.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.900]   - The people who bought it 20 years ago
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.340]   probably got a pretty good deal
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.540]   before the insurance companies discovered how
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.660]   or figured out how to price it properly,
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.140]   but I think in 2024, if you need it, you can't afford it,
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.340]   and if you can afford it, you don't need it.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.540]   - It sounded to me, and maybe I was wrong,
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.220]   but maybe a part of that question was about
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.020]   if we are self-funding and setting aside
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.540]   either mentally or literally a part of the portfolio
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.020]   for potential future long-term care costs,
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.860]   how do we allocate it?
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.980]   And to me, that is a question that I think it can be helpful
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.580]   to mentally set aside this money in the sense that
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.540]   we don't want to count on using it for other spending,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.040]   but as far as asset allocation,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.420]   I don't think there's a particularly useful way to say,
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.500]   oh, this money should be allocated that way
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.540]   because we don't know when it's going to happen.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.740]   If we knew when it would happen,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.460]   then we could pick some asset allocation
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.980]   that's a perfect match or tips maturing exactly that year
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.460]   or whatever, but we don't know.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.500]   So I don't think there's a need to segregate it out
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.020]   from an asset allocation point of view.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.380]   - And by the way, often, if the second spouse
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.920]   goes into long-term care, it's very expensive,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.460]   but you no longer have a house,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.180]   you no longer have a car, insurance, traveling,
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.580]   so there are some expenses that offset that.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.480]   - I have a question for whoever wants to jump on it
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   that's related.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.000]   I have heard from other financial planners
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.560]   that when clients don't have
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.520]   any sort of long-term care insurance,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.880]   that sometimes those are the ones
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.740]   who dramatically underspend what they could spend
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.240]   because they are very nervous
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.440]   about these potential costs hanging out there.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.000]   What do you think about that,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   that even though the financing aspects
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.360]   of insurance aren't great,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.200]   that there's a kind of a peace of mind allocation there
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.040]   that could help someone live well
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.680]   in those years that they're well?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.260]   - Well, there's two sides of that.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.160]   You've got a very expensive premium
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.680]   that could be going up,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.360]   which might cause you to spend less as well.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.480]   But it's like any insurance,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.820]   the insurance company expects to make money from it.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.940]   So your expected return is negative.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:27.220]   Absolutely, if it makes you feel better,
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.580]   allows you to spend more,
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.100]   then yes, you should do it,
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.780]   even though it may not be economically optimal.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.100]   - I will say for the young people in this room,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.460]   okay, when you get to our age,
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.080]   not Mike, just have a lot of children, right?
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.980]   I mean, one of them will take you in.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.300]   - Speaking of children, this question says,
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.060]   my son selected T. Rowe Price High Yield Bond Fund
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.220]   in his 401(k).
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.440]   He is 29 years old, so now he has 90% stock,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.380]   Vanguard 500, and 10% junk bonds.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.780]   Please give info of pros and cons
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.980]   of high yield bond funds, junk bonds.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.460]   - You know, I did a talk on the language of investing,
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.460]   and the one term my industry got right
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.180]   are calling high yield bonds junk bonds.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.460]   Don't buy junk, take your risks with stocks,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.020]   have your fixed income be the most boring part
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.120]   of your portfolio.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.860]   - And I'll give you the other side of that.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.400]   Okay, so it is part of the bond market, right?
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.420]   High yield.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.900]   Vanguard has a wonderful high yield corporate bond fund.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.100]   It's not C-rated, double C-rated.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.820]   It's BBBB, and if you look at the risk and return
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.940]   of that portfolio, it has actually done very well
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.860]   relative to the risk.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.740]   Now granted, you know, Alan is right.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.500]   It does have higher correlation with economic risk,
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.020]   so it does go down more than, say, a treasury bond fund
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.820]   when it, you know, the economy goes down.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.740]   But, you know, if you're gonna have this portfolio,
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.100]   if you're gonna add high yield bonds to your portfolio,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.700]   I think that Vanguard has probably one of the best
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.040]   high yield corporate bond funds out there.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.420]   And there is a little bit of an inefficiency
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.100]   in where they're investing in the market
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.540]   because they're buying B-rated, double B-rated,
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.020]   and so when something becomes a fallen angel
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.920]   and it drops from investment grade, which is triple B,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.500]   down to double B, you've got a much bigger pot of people,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.580]   a pot of portfolio managers, who have to sell that bond.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.500]   You get an awful lot of selling going on,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.140]   and so it depresses the price.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.700]   Vanguard is buying double B-rated bonds.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.660]   They pick this bond up, and I think they actually
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.140]   get a premium for liquidity for being able
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.020]   to buy these bonds when that happens,
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.140]   and I think this is one of the reasons
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.060]   why I think that fund has done well.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.180]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we're arguing, you know,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.380]   angels on pinheads here is, you know,
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.940]   how much extra juice do you get
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.980]   from the equity risk premium you're actually getting
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.660]   from junk bonds versus you would actually
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.580]   getting from junk bonds.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.000]   I mean, I used to play that game.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.900]   I used to, you know, wait for the spread
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.460]   to, you know, increase to 10 or 15%,
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.820]   and then I would load up on junk bonds
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.900]   until I realized I would have done
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.540]   a whole lot better investing in stocks at that point.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.340]   - Okay, we are right on time here.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.540]   I think we are going to do this kind of
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.140]   ask us anything session at future conferences.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.980]   I've loved this.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.260]   We have a huge stack of things
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.380]   that we could have gotten to and didn't have time.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.820]   So many great questions.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.460]   We are going to have to leave it there.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.660]   Please join me in thanking Rick, Mike, Alan, and Bill.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.200]   - And Christine.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.440]   (static crackling)
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.500]   you
