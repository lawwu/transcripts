[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - Pastor John, over the years you have referred
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.880]   to the acronym Aptat, A-P-T-A-T,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.960]   in your books and sermons and your classes.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.460]   It's been with you for a long time,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.640]   and it seems to be central to your understanding
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.040]   of how the Christian life should be lived each day.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.980]   And I know a lot of our listeners
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.280]   have probably never heard you explain Aptat
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.560]   and why it's so important.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   So today, introduce it to us and explain the big issue
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.940]   that it addresses for you.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.620]   - Okay, here's the big issue.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.160]   How do you go about living the Christian life
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160]   in such a way that you are actually doing the living,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.240]   doing the acting, doing the willing,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.000]   and yet Christ or the Holy Spirit
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.280]   is decisively doing the living and doing the acting
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.620]   and doing the willing in
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.600]   and through your acting and willing and doing.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   That's the key issue, it seems to me,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.800]   of the Christian life.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   That's the way Paul says he lived.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.080]   And he means for us to live that way.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   He says, 1 Corinthians 15, 10,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.800]   by the grace of God, I am what I am,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.280]   and his grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.620]   though it was not I,
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.720]   but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.440]   Now my question is,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.340]   and I think everyone listening to me right now should ask,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.900]   how do I do that?
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.020]   How do I work hard
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.860]   and yet be able to say, when I'm done,
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.860]   God's grace was the worker in and through me?
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.740]   Now that's what APTAT, A-P-T-A-T,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.820]   an acronym is intended to answer.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.500]   Or to put it another way,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.660]   how do you obey Philippians 2, 12?
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.140]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.060]   for God is the one at work in you.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.640]   What are the strategies that we take
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.300]   to make sure we can say that with integrity
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   about our Christian life?
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.900]   Or to put it another way,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   how do you serve others in a strength that isn't your own?
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.580]   1 Peter 4, 11, "Whoever serves,
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.580]   let him serve as by the strength that God supplies."
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.640]   How do you do that?
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   Or Romans 8, 13,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.140]   "By the Spirit put to death the deeds of the body."
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.940]   So how do you put to death the deeds of the body?
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.820]   Yes, you put to death the deeds of the body,
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.060]   the sinful deeds, and you do it by the Spirit.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.900]   Now what does that mean?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.020]   How do you do it?
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.020]   That's what I'm trying to get at.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.220]   Or Galatians 5, 16, "Walk by the Spirit."
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.180]   5, 18, "Be led by the Spirit."
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.220]   5, 22, "Bear the fruit of the Spirit."
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.620]   5, 25, "Keep in step with the Spirit."
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.460]   So my answer to all of that is APTAT.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.540]   It's what I did hundreds of times,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.520]   sitting on the front pew in the sanctuary,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.420]   two minutes before I'm supposed to preach,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.580]   and I did APTAT.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.740]   I walked through APTAT in my heart,
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.000]   because when I stood behind that pulpit,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.640]   I wanted to preach by the Spirit.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.900]   I wanted to preach in the strength that God supplies.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.980]   I wanted to preach in a way so that I could say,
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.500]   not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   I didn't want to get up there and do nothing.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.940]   It's my job, I'm supposed to preach.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.220]   I must preach.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.340]   And yet the devil can preach.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.700]   People can preach without the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.460]   but that's not the Christian life.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.580]   Okay, so here it is, APTAT, A-P-T-A-T.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.580]   Each of those letters stands for an action that I take,
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.460]   and you can do this in one minute
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.780]   before you face some challenge.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.940]   So A, admit.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.180]   I admit that without Christ, I can do nothing.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.300]   John 15, five, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.380]   Whoever abides in me, and I in him,
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.620]   he it is that bears much fruit,
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.620]   for apart from me, you, John Piper, can do nothing.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.220]   So I admit that, I say that, I believe that.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.340]   I am helpless to do anything of any significance,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.300]   any eternal value, any spiritual worth whatsoever
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.500]   in any way without Christ.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.660]   P, I pray.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.540]   Of course, you pray, right?
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.980]   If you admit you can do nothing, you, oh God, help me.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.020]   Ask and you will receive, Jesus said.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.620]   You do not have because you do not ask, James 4, 2.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.200]   Call on me in the day of trouble, Psalm 50, 15.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.140]   So I asked the Lord, I sat there on the pew,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.940]   and I asked the Lord for freedom from self-consciousness.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.580]   Give me liberty, give me memory,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.460]   give me authentic emotion, protect me from error.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.580]   I don't wanna mislead these people.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.580]   Give me a prophetic anointing so that words come to my mind
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.120]   that are miraculously penetrating and liberating
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.620]   and saving and purifying and emboldening for the people.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.380]   I wanted all of that to happen by the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.360]   so I'm asking for it.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   T, A-P-T, I trust a specific promise.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.960]   I think this is right at the heart of the matter.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.080]   I trust a specific promise that God has tailor-made,
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.160]   and it might not be just a preaching situation,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.520]   it might be a financial situation or a sexual temptation
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.580]   or you name it, I need a specific promise
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.980]   to believe right now 'cause I just, I wanna trust Him,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.400]   and I don't wanna just trust in general,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.920]   I wanna trust that He promised to do something for me.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.320]   So I might say, generally, I am your God,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.080]   I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.460]   I use that when, I've used that good night
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.160]   in the last 40 years, a thousand times
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.380]   as I've faced challenges in my life.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.020]   I will help you, I will strengthen you.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.440]   That's Isaiah 41, 10.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.520]   I will make all grace abound to you.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.840]   2 Corinthians 9, 8.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.160]   I am your God, I'll supply every need, Philippians 4, 19.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.920]   Or in preaching, I might say,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.200]   my word will not come back to me empty, John Piper.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.060]   Isaiah 55, it is not you who speak,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.520]   but the Holy Spirit who speaks through you, in Matthew 24.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.640]   So I take a promise and I trust it,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   I consciously preach it to myself and put my faith in it.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.920]   So APT, A, I act, act.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.560]   In obedience to God's word,
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.920]   expecting God to act under and in and through my acting
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.880]   so that it is decisively His acting.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.520]   We act the miracle.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.000]   We did a whole conference on this
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.320]   and wrote a whole book about it called "Act the Miracle."
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.880]   In fact, my book, "Future Grace,"
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.920]   is just nothing but an unpacking, you might say, of APTAT.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.800]   So act, work out your salvation, Philippians 2.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.000]   I worked harder than any of them, 1 Corinthians 15, 5.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.560]   I now live in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.240]   Galatians 2, 20.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.340]   Put to death the deeds of the body, you, by the Spirit.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.120]   So we do the acting, we are the actor,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.760]   and God is the miracle maker.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   So APTA, and then finally, when I'm done and I sit down,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   I thank Him, T, thank.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.520]   I thank God for whatever good comes.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.280]   I thank Him and I give Him glory.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   Give thanks always, Ephesians 5, 20.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   But the key, the key, the fulcrum in this sequence,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.720]   where everything hangs, I think, is that point of trusting.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.920]   Trusting God's promised help, future grace,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.320]   for the next five seconds or five minutes or five hours.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   It's called living by faith in future grace.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.080]   It's called God will help you, I will help you,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.000]   I will strengthen you, I'll meet every need,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.280]   and you trust Him for that.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.800]   That's APTA, and that's what I think it means
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   to live by the Spirit and walk by faith and by the Spirit
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.320]   and work out your salvation
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   and act the miracle of the Christian life.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.040]   And I'll just say one last thing.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.360]   I was thrilled.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.680]   I don't know how many years ago this was,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.040]   maybe 15 years ago, 'cause I've been doing APTA
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.320]   for 35 years plus.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   I was thrilled on page 126 of J.I. Packer,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.800]   Keep in Step with the Spirit, to find these exact steps.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.480]   I mean, it was uncanny.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.320]   If you go to the top of page 126, anybody,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   and look at how he describes Augustinian sanctification.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.200]   He gives APTA, and I just came out of my chair.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.700]   You know, he doesn't use the acronym,
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.320]   but the steps are all there in sequence.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.120]   So I just say that at the end here,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.320]   lest anybody think this is kind of a quirky,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.960]   quirky Piper thing, but I think it's just biblical
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.280]   through and through, and it's one of the most central
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.800]   and important discoveries I've ever made.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.680]   How do you walk by the Spirit?
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   - Confirmed by Augustine and J.I. Packer.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   That's beautiful and deeply helpful and practical.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.680]   These are the types of practical questions

[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.080]   Well, next time we hear from a listener who is burned out,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.960]   who finds life to be an unceasing grind,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.140]   and who wants Pastor John to give him perspective
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.920]   to keep him going.
