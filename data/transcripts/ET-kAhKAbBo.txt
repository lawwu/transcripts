[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380]   [silence]
[00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.220]   When we pay careful attention,
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.980]   there are two neurochemicals,
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.300]   neuromodulators as they're called,
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.580]   that are released from multiple sites in our brain
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.860]   that highlight the neural circuits
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.020]   that stand a chance of changing.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.260]   Now, it's not necessarily the case
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.340]   that they're going to change,
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.400]   but it's the first gate that has to open
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.980]   in order for change to occur.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280]   And the first neurochemical is epinephrine,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.300]   also adrenaline.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.820]   We call it adrenaline when it's released
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.280]   from the adrenal glands above our kidneys.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.120]   That's in the body.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.580]   We call it epinephrine in the brain,
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.340]   but they are chemically identical substances.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660]   Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540]   called locus coeruleus.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.060]   Fancy name, you don't need to know it unless you want to.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.060]   Locus coeruleus sends out these little wires we call axons
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.580]   such that it hoses the entire brain, essentially,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.940]   in this neurochemical epinephrine.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.300]   Now, it's not always hosing the brain with epinephrine.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.060]   It's only when we are in high states of alertness
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.980]   that this epinephrine is released.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.560]   But the way this circuit is designed,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.820]   it's very nonspecific.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.900]   It's essentially waking up the entire brain.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.980]   And that's because the way that epinephrine works
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.580]   by binding particular receptors
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.780]   is to increase the likelihood that neurons will be active.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.740]   So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.160]   However, alertness alone is not sufficient.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.600]   As we would say, it's necessary,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.060]   but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.780]   We know this is true also from the work of Hubel and Wiesel
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.460]   where they looked at brain plasticity
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.660]   in response to certain experiences
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.460]   in subjects that were either awake or asleep.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.180]   And I hate to break it to you,
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.500]   but you cannot just simply listen to things in your sleep
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800]   and learn those materials.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.620]   Later, I'll talk about how you can do certain things
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.860]   in your sleep that you're unaware of
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.580]   that can enhance learning of things
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.380]   that you were aware of while you were awake.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.020]   But that is not the same as just listening to some music
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.580]   or listening to a tape while you sleep
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.140]   and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.740]   Epinephrine is released when we pay attention
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.620]   and when we are alert.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.120]   But the most important thing for getting plasticity
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.500]   is that there'll be epinephrine,
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   which equates to alertness,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.320]   plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.420]   Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.900]   One is also in the brainstem
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.840]   and it's named different things in different animals,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.060]   but in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.860]   or neurons that make acetylcholine
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.860]   is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.920]   There are a number of different names
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.260]   of these aggregates of neurons.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.460]   You don't need to know the names.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.740]   All you need to know is that you have an area
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.660]   in your brainstem and that area sends wires,
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.440]   these axons up into the area of the brain
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.760]   that filters sensory input.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.820]   So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.240]   and it is getting bombarded
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.640]   with all sorts of sensory input all the time.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.920]   Costello's snoring off to my right,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.040]   the lights that are in the room,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.360]   the presence of my computer to my left,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.920]   all of that is coming in.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.820]   But when I pay attention to something,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.700]   like if I really hone in on Costello's snoring,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.280]   I create a cone of attention
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.220]   and what that cone of attention reflects
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.560]   is that acetylcholine is now amplifying the signal
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.160]   of sounds that Costello is making with his snoring
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.700]   and essentially making that signal greater
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.200]   than all the signal around it.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.400]   What we call signal to noise goes up.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   So those of you with an engineering background
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.640]   will be familiar with signal to noise.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.360]   Those of you who do not have an engineering background,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.200]   don't worry about it.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.940]   All it means is that one particular shout
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.480]   in the crowd comes through,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   Costello's snoring becomes more salient,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.940]   more apparent relative to everything else going on.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.300]   Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight,
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.540]   but epinephrine for alertness,
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.980]   acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.220]   Those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.820]   There needs to be this third component.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.300]   And the third component is acetylcholine released
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.740]   from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.900]   If you really want to get technical,
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.820]   it's called nucleus basalis of my nert.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.300]   For any of you that are budding physicians
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.580]   or going to medical school, you should know that.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.560]   If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.880]   acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis and epinephrine,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.120]   you can change your brain.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   And I can say that with confidence
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.320]   because Merzenich and Reckin's own,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   as well as other members of the Merzenich lab,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.500]   Michael Kilgard and others,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.820]   did these incredible experiments
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.440]   where they stimulated the release of acetylcholine
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.200]   from nucleus basalis, either with an electrode
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.600]   or with some other methods that we'll talk about.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.160]   And what they found was,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.320]   when you stimulate these three brain regions,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   locus coeruleus, the brainstem source of acetylcholine,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.940]   and then the basal forebrain source of acetylcholine,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.820]   when you have those three things,
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.540]   whatever you happen to be listening to,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.000]   doing or paying attention to,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.780]   immediately in one trial takes over the representation
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.640]   of a particular area of the brain.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.740]   You essentially get rapid, massive learning in one shot.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.100]   And this has been shown again and again and again
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.360]   in a variety of papers,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.160]   also by a guy named Norm Weinberger from UC Irvine.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.080]   And it is now considered a fundamental principle
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.320]   of how the nervous system works.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.600]   So while Hubel and Wiesel talked about critical periods
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.520]   in developmental plasticity,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.280]   it's very clear from the work of Merzenich
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.560]   and Weinberger and others,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.840]   that if you get these three things,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.120]   if you can access these three things of epinephrine,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.620]   acetylcholine from these two sources,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.280]   not only will the nervous system change, it has to change.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.720]   It absolutely will change.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.460]   And that is the most important thing
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.320]   for people to understand if they want to change their brain.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.120]   You cannot just passively experience things.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.000]   And repetition can be important,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.480]   but the way to use repetition to change your brain
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.120]   is fundamentally different.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   So now let's talk about how we would translate
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.040]   all the scientific information and history
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.440]   into some protocols that you can actually apply,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.280]   because I think that's what many of you are interested in,
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.120]   and I'm willing to bet that most of you
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   are not interested in lowering electrodes
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   into your nucleus basalis, and frankly, neither am I.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.520]   So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to take.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.340]   I'm going to describe what the literature tells us
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.040]   and suggests about ways to access plasticity.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.680]   We know we need epinephrine, that means alertness.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.020]   Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.160]   and a good night's sleep.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.880]   So I will say, you should master your sleep schedule,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.240]   and you should figure out how much sleep you need
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.120]   in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.200]   All the tools and more science
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   than probably you ever wanted to hear about sleep
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.800]   and how to get better at sleeping and timing your sleep,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   et cetera, and naps, and all of that
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.840]   is in episodes two, three, four, and five
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.000]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.740]   So I encourage you to refer to those
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.280]   if your sleep is not where you would like it to be.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.480]   Your ability to engage in deliberate focused alertness
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.280]   is in direct proportion to how well you are sleeping
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.400]   on a regular basis.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.280]   I think that's kind of an obvious one.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.200]   So get your sleep handled.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.960]   But once that's in place, the question then is,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.000]   how do I access this alertness?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.420]   Well, there are a number of ways.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.960]   Some people use some pretty elaborate
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.480]   psychological gymnastics.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.440]   They will tell people that they're going to do something
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.140]   and create some accountability.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.360]   That could be really good.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.480]   Or they'll post a picture of themselves online
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.120]   and they'll commit to losing a certain amount of weight
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.280]   or something like this.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.760]   So they can use either shame-based practices
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.320]   to potentially embarrass themselves
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   if they don't follow through.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.520]   They'll write checks to organizations that they hate
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.780]   and insist that they'll cash them
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.680]   if they don't actually follow through.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.320]   Or they'll do it out of love.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.960]   They'll decide that they're going to run a marathon
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.120]   or learn a language or something
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.400]   because of somebody they love
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.560]   or they want to devote it to somebody.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.080]   The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   and getting alert and activated, it doesn't really matter.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.360]   Epinephrine is a chemical
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.600]   and your brain does not distinguish
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.700]   between doing things out of love or hate, anger, or fear.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.540]   It really doesn't.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.520]   All of those promote autonomic arousal
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.760]   and the release of epinephrine.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.340]   So I think for most people,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.720]   if you're feeling not motivated to make these changes,
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.120]   the key thing is to identify not just one,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.220]   but probably a kit of reasons,
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.120]   several reasons as to why you would want
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   to make this particular change.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.680]   And being drawn toward a particular goal
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.200]   that you're excited about can be one.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.680]   Also being motivated to not be completely afraid,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.720]   ashamed, or humiliated
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.840]   for not falling through on a goal is another.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.960]   Just want to briefly mention one little aside there
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.840]   because I've got a friend who's a physician.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.420]   He's a cardiologist who has a really interesting theory.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.260]   This is just theory,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.320]   but I think it will resonate with a lot of people,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.160]   which is that you've all heard of this molecule dopamine
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.740]   that gives us this sense of reward
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.120]   when we accomplish something.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.840]   Well, we also want to be able to access dopamine
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.040]   while we're working towards things.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.760]   Enjoy the process, as they say,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.800]   'cause it has all sorts of positive effects.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.320]   It gives us energy, et cetera.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.400]   With my friend, what he says is,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.740]   there's many, many instances where someone will come to him
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.580]   and say, "You know what?
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.820]   I'm going to write a book."
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.360]   And he says, "Oh, that's great.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.600]   I'm sure the book's going to be terrific
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.920]   and you really should write a book."
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   And then they never go do it.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.200]   And his theory is if you get so much dopamine
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.900]   from the reward of people saying,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.920]   "Oh yeah, you're absolutely going to be able to do that,"
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.420]   you might not actually go after the reward
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.040]   of the accomplishment itself.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.400]   So beware these positive reinforcements also.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.440]   So I suggest that everyone asks themselves,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.560]   "What is it that I want to accomplish?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.680]   And what is it that's driving me to accomplish this?"
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   And come up with two or three things,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.460]   fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps,
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.280]   or perhaps several of those,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   in order to ensure alertness, energy,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.800]   and attention for the task.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.320]   (rock music)
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.760]   (upbeat music)
