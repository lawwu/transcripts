[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   And if you only have like so many words you can say a day, so many hours in the day,
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.600]   where is it worth the negotiating or dealmaking? And where isn't it? And most people spend their
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.320]   time on really low level activities. Coupon cutting, asking for a discount at a restaurant,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.280]   or for wine, or buying furniture, whatever. Okay, that's fine. But instead of doing that,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.480]   you could just be a little bit more strategic upfront and think about, "If I negotiated my
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.440]   salary every single year for sure, but maybe even twice a year, mid-year review time. Maybe if you're
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.920]   really good quarterly, I can never clip a coupon again and make more from just negotiating my
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.560]   salary." And then a second level from that is, "Man, if I could figure out how to negotiate,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   how to buy assets that cashflow and can do 100x or 300x return to me, then I don't even have to
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.880]   negotiate my salary that much. Because I just take the salary, use the salary, apply it to assets
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.040]   that I keep buying, those keep cash flowing for me." So it's all about like, what level are you
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.920]   playing? Lots of people play level one games. And I think the pros, they don't bother with that.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.600]   They don't Dave Ramsey their way to millions, right? Like it's not the fucking Starbucks.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.480]   Have the Starbucks if you want it. But instead, try to get really smart on negotiating or deal
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.800]   making so you can play the level six games and then buy whatever coffee you want.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   Cody, thank you for being here.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.720]   Thanks for having me. I'm excited.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.280]   Yeah. So I love that you've owned the phrase contrarian thinking. I really like that people
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.520]   challenge the status quo, go against the grain, whether it's life, investing, or anything.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   And nothing really highlights that to me then. We both had these early finance careers. You
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.040]   had a lucrative career on Wall Street, and then you left it to do something,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.400]   invest in boring businesses. I'm sure so many people talked you out of it.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.320]   What drove that early contrarian thinking for you?
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.800]   I can't remember who said it, but I loved that quote. "What it takes to be successful
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.840]   is first you have to be contrarian, and then second, you have to be right."
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.560]   And I think that's true. I mean, you know from being in finance, you can't make money if you
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   follow the herd. You'll basically pick up pennies continuously, but that won't ever amount to
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.480]   dollars. And so I think the thing that made me want to leave actually had nothing to do with
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.040]   being contrarian. It was that it was categorically fucking miserable. It was miserable being in
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.480]   finance for so long, especially when I was at the big firms like Goldman Sachs, State Street,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.240]   Vanguard. Vanguard, I thought was like, sorry, Bogle, but left of communism from a workers
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   perspective. It was just everybody is the same. It doesn't matter if you outperform. It was the
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.360]   opposite of a meritocracy, which is what I wanted. You could only progress in your career at certain
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.600]   levels and years and timelines like the military. So I was like, this is awful. Got to go.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.760]   Then I went to Goldman Sachs. And at Goldman, it was sort of the opposite. It was like, no matter
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.800]   what, 20% cut every single year. And if you don't perform, cut. And if people don't like you, cut.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.760]   And so that was a really aggressive environment. And I actually liked it more, I think.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.080]   But then finally, where I ended up was in private equity, running with a couple other partners. And
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.920]   I think what I realized, Chris, is you were smart. You were like, I didn't last that long in finance,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.640]   you know, and I got out. And I think I thought, oh, it's just not this company. It's not this
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.960]   company. It's not this company. And then I realized, oh no, I hate finance. It just took
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.120]   me 12 years to figure this out. And in actuality, maybe I'm more entrepreneurial and I want to do
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   my own thing. And I just got sort of a really long PhD in how to buy businesses and how to
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720]   structure deals from being in finance for a long time. But you remember, I mean,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.040]   when you were in investment banking, how long did you work?
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.080]   My kind of tipping point was I didn't see my girlfriend then, now wife, for a week awake.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.480]   And I was like, this is just untenable. I just don't... What's the purpose?
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   And then I had the same experience. I moved to management consulting.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.400]   And I remember we were courting like a Fortune 50 company. And a friend of mine's mother-in-law
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.040]   happened to be the CEO of that company. And I remember going to the managing director and
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.800]   saying, "Hey, I know you guys are courting this company. I'm going to be at the CEO's
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.000]   house this weekend because my friend happens to be her son-in-law. How can I help?"
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.920]   And they were like, "Your job is to make slides. Why would you help?"
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.480]   And I was like, "Well, I actually have a relationship with the person you're..."
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.160]   And they're like, "That's not your job." And I was like, "This just seems like you're not
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.080]   thinking about business as a way to take every advantage and try to be successful.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.040]   You have these rules." And I was like, "I don't like rules. I don't like rules that
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.880]   don't make sense. I love rules that make sense. I don't like rules that don't make sense."
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.960]   And that was the downhill of that career. So it was just brutal work that... The no
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.240]   meritocracy thing was driving me nuts. It was just like, "This is what you do."
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.160]   But I ultimately got laid off. So that kicked me out earlier. So maybe you didn't have that
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.200]   good fortune, which in hindsight feels fortunate. And in the moment, it wasn't.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   But what was it that led you to something that...
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   It's not like you went into this other career that everyone knows, and it was very popular.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.400]   You started doing something that I think, even years later, is not popular.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.600]   So maybe give a little context to what it is to buy these businesses. But what led you to start
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.120]   doing it? The secret is, I think, that the really,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   really wealthy have always bought these businesses. I mean, richest guy in the world,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.680]   owner of LVMH. How did he get there? Did he start those companies? No, he bought them.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.600]   He bought a bunch of these companies. Some of them basically out of bankruptcy, like Dior.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.000]   And he amassed a massive empire from the fact of buying... I mean, if we think about it, really,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.960]   bag companies, clothing companies. They just have fancy labels on them that are highly overpriced.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   And so that's how the richest guy in the world made his money. The richest guy in India
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.840]   made his money through a conglomerate of businesses that he bought.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   I mean, you look at a lot of the Fortune 500, and what you see, if you peel back the layers,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:07.360]   and you get rid of all of the heirs of Walmart, let's say, and the heirs of some of the large
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   historical industries like Rockefellers, etc, you find that most of these people actually got there,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.480]   not always from starting companies, but from buying. The second most common is from buying
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.920]   companies. And so in finance, private equity, we did that all day. I think that... Oh, they're not
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.680]   going to like that I say this, but I think people in private equity are brilliant in a way, but it's
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.160]   slightly predatory. We are so sneaky that we make entrepreneurs think that putting their blood,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.520]   sweat, and tears into companies is like the fun game. This is what it means to be an innovator.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.440]   This is what it means to be a creator and to build huge businesses. And then right about at the point
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.880]   where they want to slit their wrists, private equity swoops in and we say, "Is it miserable
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.720]   running your company? Do you not want to do this anymore? Are you ready for something else? What
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.680]   if we give you a great offer?" And what the entrepreneur doesn't realize is that 0 to 1
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.800]   is the least profitable period of time in your business. The most profitable period of time
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.280]   is actually the next stage. And then the stage where you continue to cashflow for a really long
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.320]   time on it. And so we scoop up these businesses at a period of time where the entrepreneur is in pain
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   often, and then we cashflow on them forever. And it's a gross generalization. That's not
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.760]   what all private equity firms do. But once I realized that, I was like, "Wait a second."
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.840]   So we don't have to be clever enough to come up with an idea. I'm not clever enough to come up
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.320]   with some crazy new billion dollar idea for a company. I don't know. But what I do know is
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.680]   how to look at what are expenses and what is income, aka a P&L, and tell me if this business
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.160]   is making money or not. And do I think that this business could continue to exist inside of the
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.360]   next 3 to 10 years? At which point I'll have all of my money back plus 3 to 5X, let's say.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.520]   I can't go figure that out. And because that's not that difficult, why couldn't I do for myself
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.080]   what the big huge guys do with LBOs, leveraged buyouts, and all of that, but at a tiny scale
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.000]   with laundromats and car washes and things that cost $50,000 or $100,000 and then scaling up to
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   a million and a 5 and a 10. It's the same game. It's just I'm playing it at a smaller level,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.680]   at the mom and pop level, and what I call or what is called micro P&E.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   And that mom and pop level, I think when anyone listening is thinking, "Oh wow,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.760]   Cody goes and buys businesses. She must be a billionaire." It sounds like something you could
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   actually make part of your investment portfolio at a very early stage in your wealth building
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.720]   journey and grow from there. Would you say it's for anyone or who is buying a small business for?
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.640]   The only people it isn't for are the lazy and the completely risk averse. So if you want to do zero
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   work, if you want to have zero risk, then don't buy businesses. It's just not going to work out
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.320]   for you. And so if people are trying to sell you Airbnb arbitrage and you take no risk and you
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.400]   bring on these people and you make your millions, okay, fine, do that. But I think for people that
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.040]   are willing to put in some work, there's no better way to make a return on it than having equity
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.640]   ownership that cash flows over time. And the problem is if you look at the S&P 500 or where
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.720]   people typically invest, what is a good dividend paying stock? Three to maybe 9%. I mean, gosh,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   if you could get a 12% paying dividend stock, you're probably thinking that it's going to have
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   some downside, right? Because that's too much. But in a small, boring business, you could have
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   a return on your money of high double digits in a year. You could return all of your capital within
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.320]   a year. And so I think it is for "anybody" that's willing to put in some work. Now the flip side to
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.960]   that is then people go, "Cody, sounds great, but I don't actually have millions," right?
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.880]   And I like to give examples like I bought a newsletter for $3,000 just for shits and giggles.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.440]   I wanted to put it into our media empire. I realized it didn't really fit. It wasn't going
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   to grow the way that I wanted to. So I turned around and sold it, I think a week later for $8,000.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.200]   And that for me at the stage that I was at was not meaningful. But for young Cody,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   like the Cody whose parents had no money, who used to bounce her checking account
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.600]   every weekend, who thought her first job making $37,000 a year was amazing.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.040]   That was like, "I'm rich. I just made $5K in a week off of flipping somebody else's asset."
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.160]   That's fascinating. And so if you can start at that level, you can start to understand the
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.520]   bigger levels. The $100,000 deals, the $1 million deals, and the $100 million deals, I think.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.600]   Yeah. So one of the nice things... So yes, the return expectations of the stock market,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:44.160]   maybe 5%, 7%, 8%. But it's very easy to maintain a job and do that on the side because there's no
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.960]   work. Is the amount of work you need to go buy a boring business, a laundromat or something,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.680]   enough that you don't need to quit your job? Can it be a side hustle? Or how full time
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.320]   is doing this type of investing? I think it's very similar to rental
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.440]   properties. What sucks about getting rental properties? Well, first, you have to understand
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.080]   the market. You got to understand what's a good buy, what's a bad buy. Then you've got to actually
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.760]   get a mortgage. You've got to figure out what that looks like. Then you have to figure out how to get
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.000]   somebody to rent your property out. But after you have that first period of understanding,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.640]   you either Airbnb it out with some consistency or you get a property manager that manages it.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.480]   And I think it's really similar to businesses. Depending on the size and scale and type,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   you can have a business that's less active. I try to not say passive because I think that's
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.280]   a fallacy overall, but that's less active. And those businesses are, I think, all around.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   I use the example of car washes and laundromats and vending machines less because they're incredibly
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   passive, but more because I call them the gateway drug businesses. So basically, you can get your
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.600]   little skin in the game. You can get your little first hit of being in business and being the
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.240]   owner. And then as you do that, you're like, "Oh, wait, this game is kind of fun. Maybe I'll do
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.640]   another one. I'm more capable than I thought." And I just think the world looks a lot better
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.040]   if we have more humans with skin in the game. And I think you can absolutely do it while you're
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:12.640]   still working. My caveat is always just... I had a boss, basically, back in the day.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:19.760]   We were in Latin America and we were running an investment business in there. And we basically
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   had to do this evolution with one of the government entities where they wanted us to
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.360]   run a process to make sure that our security protocols and the way we were investing
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:39.040]   met their government requirements. And so we ran that once. Check, check. All the boxes checked
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.240]   that we were supposed to. They wanted us to run it again. So we ran it again. And then the last time,
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.160]   they wanted us to run it one more time. And now, I didn't agree that we should run this
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.920]   exercise three times. I thought that was ridiculous. But my boss basically said, "Hey,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   this go around. I'm agreeing to this. And the reason why is because I want to get our leaders
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.640]   to trust me a little bit more. And I also want to get our team used to doing things that are hard
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.080]   that we don't want to do, because we're going to have to do some really hard stuff for this project
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.920]   we were working on. There's a lot of turnaround assets." And so he's like, "So I need you guys
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   to support me in doing that." And we looked around and I remember I asked, I was like, "Well,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.640]   are they actually going to know if we did this or not? Can we just check the box that we did this?"
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:34.960]   And he just looked back at me and was like, "What do you think would be the right thing to do?"
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:42.880]   And I was like, "Oh, fuck. Fine." And so basically, I think the right way to do a
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.680]   business while you have a job is to make sure you're doing it the right way. And I think the
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   only thing I see going wrong in people's lives is I've seen people get fired from their jobs when
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.880]   they don't disclose that they have a side hustle. And I think it eats at your soul a little bit to
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.240]   not live in the light. And so as an owner of a business, I take it personally, if people are
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.120]   working in my business and on my business, and really they're focused on something else, they
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.200]   want to be doing something else. And remember, when you own a business in the future, you will
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.040]   be the person with employees that might be distracted. So I always kind of push people to
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   think like you already are an owner, and then ask yourself, "What would you want your employees to
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.600]   do?" That's my only caveat to side hustles these days. I think those sites where people have the
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.880]   Reddit sites where they have 400 different jobs, and these people who talk about having 37 side
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.560]   hustles, I actually think it makes you distracted, it makes you less happy, and it often makes you
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.360]   less money. And so if you're going to buy a business, make sure you do it the right way,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.840]   set the right amount of hours. And if your job doesn't allow for it, then pick a different job
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.760]   or take the risk entirely. But don't be a human not living in the light is my only caveat.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.880]   That makes sense. So you made the reference to rentals. Why do you think it is that buying
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.920]   a rental property is like, for some reason, so sexy when it comes to how do you spend your money
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.840]   and build your wealth, and buying a business like a laundromat is just not even on the same radar
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.440]   in terms of societal opinion? When it sounds from what I heard you say, the returns might be even
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.640]   better. They both are work. Why haven't people caught on? Is this like the secret? Obviously,
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.880]   you're the champion of it, but... Buying rental properties is a 1-10 step process
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.640]   that is clearly defined. And most everybody knows what you're supposed to do. There's not
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:41.840]   a lot of variation. You can't take a house in a neighborhood here and make one house do 100x more
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.440]   than the house located next to it in rent, typically. You could maybe make a house do a
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.360]   little bit more in rent by having a nicer house, but you're putting a ton more cash in there.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.120]   So you go step one through 10, you have a rental property, those are clearly defined.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.480]   And because of that, lots of people do it. And so the opaqueness or what we would call the
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.720]   arbitrage window of people who don't know the good trade to do and people who do know what
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.440]   the good trade to do is actually really tiny in rental land because everybody's playing the game.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   In buying small business, steps one through 10 look really different if you buy a laundromat
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.600]   than if you buy an online business than if you buy an education company, right? And so there's
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.680]   not a clearly defined process, which typically freaks people out. People on the internet love
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.360]   for me to tell them, "Here's the three businesses I would buy. You should go buy them right now.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.040]   This is what they cost. This is why you should buy them. This is what they should make."
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.800]   But the truth of it is, is that in business buying, it's all personal. So a good deal for me,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.120]   it's probably not a good deal for you because you live in San Francisco, I live in Austin,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.120]   because you need the deal to make you a million dollars a year. And I only knew the deal to make
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.360]   me $100,000 a year because you want to spend 40 hours on a business and I want to spend zero
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:58.320]   hours on a business. And so that's the difference is anytime there's an arbitrage window like this,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.760]   where there's no clearly defined process, there aren't a ton of people doing it.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.440]   You're going to have more opportunity, but you're going to have less action takers
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.280]   because people like to be led.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.560]   If there's not a lot of information, or I guess there's not a lot of process defined
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.960]   for every business because it's unique, how much expertise does someone really need? Or
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.840]   said a different way, how much work would it be to get up to speed to be able to buy
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.040]   a laundromat? I don't know anything about how laundromats run.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.000]   Do I need to become an expert there to really make that work?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.320]   In my opinion, no. I bought a laundromat. I couldn't even tell you today how to fix
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.920]   machines. We own laundromats that do like $3 million a year. I have no idea how to run them.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.840]   I don't know any of their SOPs and processes. It's not that I'm lazy on that stuff. It's just
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.600]   leverage. It's kind of like... Somebody was asking me right now, "How do you run
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.360]   your marketing segment of your business? What do your funnels look like? Do you have ads that go
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.800]   to your business?" I'm like, "I have no idea. That's Chris. You got to talk to this guy."
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.680]   And it's the same with buying businesses. So what you need to learn is how to be a dealmaker,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.600]   which I think is actually way more important. You got to learn what a good business looks
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.080]   like for you. And we have a 10-step process in this, but you basically have to learn
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.880]   what's a good deal for you. You have to learn how to sell yourself.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.120]   You have to learn how to negotiate. You have to learn how to finance the deal.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.720]   You have to learn how to do diligence, the deal, make sure they're not lying to you.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.960]   You got to learn how to close the deal, the proper structure, terms, etc.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   You got to get your deal team together. So your attorney, accountant,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.920]   you have to understand what your first 90 days will look like post-close.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:38.000]   You have to learn how to value a deal, what the deal is actually worth. And you got to learn...
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.480]   You've got to learn origination, how to find a deal. And so if you learn those 10 steps,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.320]   you can apply those across any industry.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.440]   And I think the opportunity for us is like most people say, "I don't understand HVAC,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.600]   so I could never buy that. I don't understand a painting company, so I would never buy that."
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.160]   And if you actually just understand how to buy businesses, you can find experts and consultants
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.400]   for nothing to help you understand a sector. You've just got to find the right deal.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.160]   So for anyone who just heard that and was like, "Whoa, 10 steps. I'm hoping
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.040]   that you can either send me a link or I could just pretty easily find those 10
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.120]   steps written somewhere and that we don't have to go deep down each one because
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.960]   that could probably be an entire conversation." So assuming that's correct...
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.160]   Yes. I will send that to you.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.240]   Awesome. Perfect. I will put that in the show notes. So the deal making is important.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.440]   Anything else someone needs to be thinking about when it comes to like,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   "What is a good opportunity? What is a bad opportunity? What does it look like when
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.880]   things go wrong?"
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.920]   Oh, what does it look like when things go wrong? There are really 2 things that people do
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.720]   that make them unhappy that they bought a business. One is they buy a job, not a business.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.800]   So they go too small. So they're like, "Ah, I want to do this deal. It only has $60,000 in profit,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.000]   but I only have to pay $100,000 for it. So this is awesome."
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.560]   And then they realize, "Oh man, now I own a cleaning company in which I am the cleaner."
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.320]   Not ideal, right? So typically, you want to go a little bit bigger.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   And then the second thing they do wrong is they don't follow some of our key commandments.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:11.120]   And over the years, I've realized a few. First of all, 50-50 partnerships, bad.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   Somebody's in control. Somebody's not in control. That has to be the case. No partnerships.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.520]   Two, your partner or operator who runs the business never gets equity day one.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.280]   They earn it over time in investing year over year, where basically if they hit X parameters,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   then they win.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.000]   Three, you stay out of the 5 areas that I don't like to invest in.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.360]   Things like restaurants, FBA, hotels, those businesses for a myriad of reasons aren't my
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   favorite. Four, people when they buy their first business, often buy what they think
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:52.240]   a business can be, not what a business is. So I buy facts and realities. People often
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.880]   buy hopes and dreams. And so what you really want to do is make sure that the business is
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.800]   profitable today, that the valuation you're paying is the right valuation for how much
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   profit you make and nothing else, and that you're not focusing on "What could I do to
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.720]   this business?" And thus, this business is going to be a fixer-upper and it's going to
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.960]   be worth a million bucks because I'm so awesome.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.560]   Instead, I assume I'm an idiot. I won't be able to get this business to do any more in
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.360]   revenue than it's doing right now. But that revenue is worth the price I'm paying. If
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   you do those things, you're usually pretty tight.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   Sounds like take all the advice that I learned being a venture capitalist and investing in
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.920]   early-stage startups and do the exact opposite for every single...
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.720]   Throw it out the window.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.520]   Throw it all out.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.880]   Out.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.240]   And for someone listening, thinking, "Wow, you have it all figured out." I have to imagine
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.920]   there's at least a story or two of a deal that just didn't turn out well and that everyone
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   makes mistakes. And that's just part of the process.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:51.120]   Oh, yeah. What usually goes wrong is people lie to you and you believe them. I think humans,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.720]   we're really good at one thing, which is making ourselves believe the lies that we tell.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.560]   I actually think humans are incredible self-rationalizers. So it's not always that
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.760]   the owners are bad. It's that they have talked themselves into a story. But we have one company
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.440]   I bought. It was actually in the cannabis space. And it was a pretty big deal. I think
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.800]   it was a $12 million deal. And this cannabis company, it was the backbone of cannabis.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:21.680]   They did like packaging of products, basically. And all the financials checked out. We did a
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.960]   review of them. We looked at their accounting. We looked at the money that they had in the bank.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.320]   All reasonable. The profit seemed reasonable. So we buy the company and we leave the operator in.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   We're going to buy a large majority, 60-70% of the business. And then he's going to keep
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.000]   a 20% stake, but he's going to continue to run it. It's growing pretty nicely.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:47.200]   But lo and behold, this guy got one of his friends to put all the money in. So all the
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.720]   cash in the bank account was not right. Had his accountant in on it, who was actually one of his
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.560]   family members. And so his family member accountant had cooked the books, which we didn't realize.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:09.360]   And then he was actually in San Francisco. And he was doing cocaine and mistresses and
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   all sorts of stuff and had an extra apartment. So one day, we have this tracking app that we
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.840]   use to follow the cash that they have. And we see a big drop in the bank account.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.040]   And so we get confused by that. And he says, "Oh no, it's moving inventory around."
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.280]   And give some example. I don't really remember. And then two weeks later, he calls us and he's
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.600]   like, "The thing is, we're out of cash. And in two weeks, we'll be closed down."
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.880]   And we were like, "What the... This company had $3 million in the bank and was profitable
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:48.640]   and making $5 million. What?" And so anyway, that deal was a ton of work. So what that meant
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.760]   is we had to fire him. Lawsuits happened. We had to take over the company. We had to put in a new
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:02.880]   operator. And that happens in doing deals. But typically, you're not going to get massive fraud
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.640]   and lies up front, just sometimes. You've done, I don't know, probably close to 100 deals,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.880]   I'm guessing at this point. What's the success rate of these buying small business deals?
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:22.160]   Oh, like 99%. Most of the deals work out. I can count on one hand. I've maybe had 3 deals go
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.800]   wrong. That cannabis company, my very first investment, which was a little bit more like
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.560]   a venture-style deal. I invested in a friend, which is a good way to have things go shaky.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.720]   Without much due diligence. And I had one deal... The only other one that went wrong
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.680]   was a business that I invested in, and it was too small. And I bought a large majority of it,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.160]   but the operator still wanted to be involved. And it was just a waste of time, basically.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.360]   So I got all my money back in that deal, plus 3 or 4x. But at some point, I actually just ended
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.400]   up giving the business back to him. I was like, "The thing is, just never call me again."
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.000]   And he was happy because he had his business to motor along with. And I was like, "Oh man,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.760]   this just isn't a big enough deal for me." But for the most part, we don't have the 80% thing.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.880]   I mean, in your venture funds, you guys kind of assume
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.600]   what? 1% to 5% to 10% of them are going to return the fund?
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.840]   I mean, usually, yeah. The goal is like you're looking for the deal that will return the fund.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.040]   It's a totally different multiple. I wanted to humanize the fact that
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.120]   just because you know so much in this space, you started somewhere where you didn't,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.680]   and you still had some bumps along the road, but also the success rate overall is pretty high.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.480]   Because I think that's important for anyone thinking about this as an asset class.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.520]   But when you talk about buying businesses, you briefly touched on ways to finance things.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.560]   But I think one of the most interesting things I've learned from you
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   in your content is just that you don't actually have to have $100,000 to buy a $100,000 business,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.800]   which is just kind of... I think it's probably the big unlock that no one knew.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.680]   Can you talk a little bit about or maybe give some examples of why
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   that is true? Because it certainly doesn't seem it.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.640]   Yeah. It's 2 magic words when you don't have money. And that's seller financing,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.920]   which used to be a thing in real estate. You used to be able to sometimes buy a house.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.360]   And from the future profits you got off a rental unit,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.440]   you could buy that house for $0 down and pay them over time.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.040]   So the seller would finance your purchase. Now it's not so normal.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.720]   But in buying businesses, it's very normal. 60% of all businesses are bought using essentially
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   the seller's future profits. And the reason why is because you've run a business or
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.440]   7 before. So how miserable is running a business sometimes?
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.560]   It's tough, right? And so for a lot of these sellers, they've been doing this for 10,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.920]   20, 30 years. Then at some point, they're ready for the next thing,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.080]   even if it's a profitable business. But they're stuck in it because unlike a job,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   not everybody knows how to exit a business. Everybody knows how to leave a company.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.160]   Not a lot of people know how to sell their company. Not a lot of people know you can
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.560]   even sell your company. And so there are a ton of sellers out there who are trapped in their business.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.720]   Most of these sellers do not have enough cash for retirement.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.640]   More than 70% of them do not have a transition plan for the next generation to take over
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.720]   or somebody else to take over. And so you come in as a little bit of a solution for that.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.640]   And how that works really quickly, for instance, I always use this one deal because it was one
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   of my smaller deals in the beginning, is I bought a laundromat for like $100K a year
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   that did $67,000 in profit. And that bit... So that's a one and a half, roughly X.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:40.880]   And one and a half X, the profits of the business is how you value these for everybody listening.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:47.840]   And so I buy this laundromat, but I don't use my own cash to do it. I tell the seller,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.080]   "Over a three-year period, I'm going to pay you back from the profits of the business to take
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.400]   over your business. And at the end of three years, great, you have your full 100K. And at the end of
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.840]   the three years, I own the business outright." And this is very common. And I would say it's
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.280]   not always common you get 100%, but it's more common than people think.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.080]   So a business costs $100,000, the business is making enough profit to pay for that.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.200]   Like, why is this a good deal for the seller just to get out? It seems like a great deal for you
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.720]   because the business pays him back with the profits, you don't spend anything.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.040]   Yeah, it goes back to the old supply and demand curve. When you have a lot of
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:29.840]   supply and not a lot of demand, then you're in charge. And so there's somewhere around the range
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.480]   of 10 to 12 billion small businesses for sale. There's a great article, actually, we did a video
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.000]   on it about Japan, and they have a crisis in business owners starting to give away their
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.120]   business for $0. I'm not talking $0 seller financing, I'm talking $0 because the next
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   generation doesn't want to run a goat herding business, or they don't want to run a plumbing
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.880]   business. And so the founders of the companies just shut them down, or they try to give them
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.680]   away. So this is a real thing that happens every day. In fact, a lot of people don't think that
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   they have a business, they think that they have a job. So think about your neighborhood wedding
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:15.360]   photographer, who also happens to have some contracts for high school photos that they do
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   every year. They do $100,000 in revenue a year. It's a great little business for them. That's
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.960]   their business. They do $100,000 a year. And when you take out their salary, which at this point,
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.520]   they pay themselves the full amount. But let's say you take out their salary of like $60,000,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:38.160]   $70,000, that leaves $30,000 to $40,000 profit. That person, when they're done being a wedding
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.480]   photographer and a high school photo photographer, they probably just like stop and go do something
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.600]   else. But those contracts with the high schools are worth something, that residual revenue is
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.520]   worth something, their gear is worth something, their website, the SEO that's built up, all of
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.240]   these jobs have inherent value to them. And it's just that a lot of people, there's a big mismatch.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.760]   And it's one thing we're working on trying to build right now, so I should talk to you about,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.600]   but I'm trying to build right now, a better mousetrap, because there's something called
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.400]   Biz Buy Sell, which is like the Zillow or Redfin of small businesses to buy, except it's awful.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:21.200]   It's like bad UI/UX, a bunch of garbage on there. The financials aren't clean. They have business
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.400]   brokers that never respond to you. It's not a great site, but it's the best of all of the bad,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:33.280]   right? And so, we're trying to figure out how to find... How to build a marketplace where
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:40.160]   sellers can come and trust that there's going to be non-looky-loo buyers on it. And we can
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.240]   sort of normalize the information and pair the two. But there's not a lot of that right now.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.000]   So that wedding photographer can't find you, the young new photographer, that would love to buy
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.640]   that business. Because you, the young photographer, are just thinking, "Oh, I'm just gonna go start my
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.440]   own." As opposed to, "What if I could buy it? What if I could... Instead, when I graduate dental
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.480]   school, what if I could buy somebody's practice and I could give them an annuity in retirement,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.000]   but I get to start that?" Instead, people just retire.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.040]   I think buying small businesses is the next real estate. And in 10 to 20 years,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   it will be completely commoditized and normalized in a way that it is not today.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.880]   But until then, there's a lot of opportunity. If there's not a platform to do it,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.200]   is it knocking on doors? Is that how you find these businesses in your local community?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.960]   We started one company... Well, actually, we bought a company. I bought a company called
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.520]   BizScout. BizScout.io. And that company sources off-market deals. And so basically,
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.960]   if you want to buy a car wash in your geographic area, it pulls together all the data from
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.320]   Yelp and Google and business listings and pulls them into one location. Also cross-references
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   that with PPP loans, so you can try to get to who the owner is in your location.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.520]   And then... And maybe needed some help. And so might be more likely to sell now.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   And then also pulls this list of proprietary deals we have from having this big audience.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.440]   So BizScout.io is the one that we want to build off of. It's what I use right now.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:12.240]   And then... Yeah. I mean, I think the best way to buy a business is different than buying a house.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.960]   It's almost like buying a house back in the day. Before Realtors, you would be like, "Oh,
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.360]   my friend Sally is selling. You want to get into the neighborhood? You should talk to Sally."
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.120]   That's foreign to my generation. We can't even imagine you just buy houses on word of mouth.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   What's wrong with you people? But that is actually the best way to buy a small business
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.040]   is to build up your network or do what I call a personal P&L review, where you look at all of your
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.840]   expenses and you see which CEOs of those companies you could actually get to. And you start nurturing
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.720]   relationships and saying, "Oh man, you guys produced my podcast. All the hacks. How's that
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.440]   business going? Is it profitable? How long have you been doing it? A while. Cool. Is this something
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.480]   you want to do forever? You want to keep running this business? No, you don't. You're ready for
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.320]   the next thing. Interesting." I actually buy small businesses. If you had an offer at the
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.640]   right price and the right terms, would you be open to a conversation on potentially getting acquired
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.280]   or an investment that comes with distributing equity, cash flow, something like that?
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.840]   "Oh, you might be interested in that? Great. Now we're in the game."
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.720]   So you mentioned deal-making earlier being an important skill. And then you just said
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.280]   at the right price and the right terms. I think you have a pretty contrarian perspective there
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.200]   that most people think price is the most important. But I think you believe terms
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   are actually more important. Can you talk about that?
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.880]   Only amateurs think price is the most important thing. That is something that people egotistically
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:40.080]   want to put on their Twitter feed. "I sold for 7 figures." That's awesome. Because you know that,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.920]   you have a great leverage point that you should just poke at. The real pros know that terms are
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.400]   the only thing that matters. If I was to say to a seller, "Hey, I'll buy your business for $2
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.520]   million, which is what you want. I think your business is only worth $1 million. So here's
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:04.000]   how we're going to do it. I'm going to give you X dollars upfront. And then if your business hits
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.080]   the goals that you say it's going to hit, because your business is so great, it should be worth $2
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.360]   million, I will pay you that amount over time. In fact, we can put it in escrow. We can put it
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.840]   in writing. You can have a clawback provision if you hit those numbers. But until then, I'm only
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.160]   going to pay this amount." And so you can say, "Hey, Chris, great. I'll buy your business for
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.760]   $2 million." But that amount might only end up being $500,000 or $750,000 if you structure the
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   deal right. And that's where the game is. That's where the fun part for me is in dealmaking.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.520]   Because you sell a house, there's no wiggle room. You're like, "Here's the price. It is
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   what it is." Maybe you get a realtor to skip their commission or you get a better rate.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.880]   But that's it. Buying a business, you can play as many chords as you want to.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.240]   It's funny because as you said that, I was like, "Wow, I tried to play that game when I was buying
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.440]   a house." But at the end of the day, it was like, I got them to throw in some plants, a TV, and
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.600]   rebate half a percent of the commission. And it's nowhere near the kind of impact you're talking...
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:07.760]   It felt good. I'm doing an episode maybe in a month or 2 about how to optimize the home buying
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.360]   process. There are levers there, but they don't sound nearly as opportunistic and awesome as the
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.720]   levers you could play buying a business. I think maybe the key to life and being
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.280]   successful is playing the right games. And if you only have so many words you can say a day,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.880]   so many hours in the day, where is it worth the negotiating or dealmaking and where isn't it?
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:33.840]   And most people spend their time on really low level activities. Coupon cutting, asking for a
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.960]   discount at a restaurant or for wine or buying furniture, whatever. Okay, that's fine. But
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.240]   instead of doing that, you could just be a little bit more strategic upfront and think about,
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.080]   "If I negotiated my salary every single year, for sure, but maybe even twice a year,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.320]   mid-year review time, maybe if you're really good quarterly, I can never clip a coupon again
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.840]   and make more from just negotiating my salary." And then a second level from that is, "Man,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.800]   if I can figure out how to negotiate, how to buy assets that cashflow and can do 100x or 300x
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.120]   return to me, then I don't even have to negotiate my salary that much because I just take the
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.080]   salary, use the salary, apply it to assets that I keep buying. Those keep cash flowing for me."
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.640]   So, it's all about what level are you playing? Lots of people play level one games. And I think
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:29.200]   the pros, they don't bother with that. They don't Dave Ramsey their way to millions, right? It's not
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.400]   the fucking Starbucks. Have the Starbucks if you want it. But instead, try to get really smart on
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   negotiating or dealmaking, so you can play the level six games and then buy whatever coffee you
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:44.480]   want. I feel like I like playing all six levels of games at the same time, which is maybe my
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.360]   problem as I end up spending too much time there. But I agree that you could save a little here or
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.720]   there, worry about that. But if you're not working on your salary, if you're not working on income,
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.360]   if you're not working on your investments, it's not there. But I think for the right person,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.840]   getting that Starbucks for free because you played the Starbucks rewards thing
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.120]   and they had a double star day, it just feels good sometimes.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.440]   So I think that's my challenge is that every now and then, knowing that you got this thing
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.440]   for half the price, that satisfaction just fuels and makes me excited. But I'm not doing it for the
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.800]   money, to be clear. It's a different type of game where it's really more about enjoyment
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.040]   and satisfaction of what I'm doing day to day. But I have realized that as you level that up,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:31.440]   it's not about trying to save $2. It's like, "How do I apply that principle to something else?"
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   And so I'm working... I think I've talked a few times about working on this book about
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.760]   principles of optimization in life. And part of it is that. It's like, "How do you go 80%,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.200]   get the 80-20 out of optimizing your travel? And then instead of going down the 20,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.480]   think about what do I care more about? Oh, maybe I care about my health. Let's go do the 80-20 on
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.920]   my health before I go... Once you've done all the 80s, sure. Go take 10% more on each one."
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.160]   So that's, I think, the next level thing that I'm working on, just generally,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.840]   and try to put a little bit more thought behind it because it's a broad topic.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:09.520]   I love that. Well, yeah. It's interesting because you're right, you play a lot of the points games,
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.800]   which I think are fun and valuable. I love a discount. I do love a discount. I love a deal.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:24.720]   And I think I will always, no matter how wealthy I am, try to get them to optimize the sides I want
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.400]   on a dish and give me them for free as opposed to add-ons to the dish, which really ticks me off.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:38.880]   And so I play that game. But I think the question that I come back to, and I'd be curious your take
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.520]   on, is if we're going to play these optimizing games, I think a lot of people fuck around and
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:54.160]   find out these days. They're like Twitter guys talking about their ice baths and their saunas,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:03.200]   and these things that have, let's call it, could you even say a 1% difference? 1% to 5%. Let's be
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.920]   generous and say ice baths and saunas give you a 1% to 5% better overall health, which I think
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:16.080]   that would be a lot. Maybe even go 10%. It's like instead, man, I looked at your profile picture.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.600]   How about you go to the gym five days a week for one hour? And then instead, how about we skip some
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   of the processed food? And for a day, a day a week, you try to not do processed food.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.680]   And so I think a lot of people choose the wrong games and they make life way harder than they
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.120]   need to. And I do this in many different ways. It's like, I want to optimize all these things
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.400]   on the fringes because they seem cool. When if you want to get fit, it's just like be more active,
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:48.320]   eat healthier food, and sort of that's it. But instead, we want to add 37 supplements
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.360]   and 472 podcasts and like three ice baths before you've fully woken up.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.480]   It's funny because I was listening to talk Peter Atiyah gave, and he wrote this really long book
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.120]   that I really enjoyed about life. It's called Outlive. And he was someone saying, "Well,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   if you could just do one thing." He's like, "Look, almost none of this book matters if you're not
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.240]   just exercising. If you're not exercising, don't even open the book. You don't need to do all of
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.920]   these things. But if you are exercising and you are eating healthy, the data on sauna is pretty
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:24.800]   great in terms of longevity and health, but it's nowhere near as good as the data on what it means
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.880]   to just go out and exercise and go on a run or lift weights or whatever, whatever form of strength
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:35.520]   or cardio or zone, whatever you want, that is going to do more than other things. But if you're
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.640]   already doing that, I think decide where you want to spend your time. If you have a family history
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.560]   of a certain type of illness, well, okay, what's the thing that might be best at preventing that?
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.760]   Great place to spend time. But I agree that if you're focusing on... If you're not exercising
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.280]   and you're eating like crap, any amount of little tiny optimizations are not the priority to focus
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.120]   on. But sometimes it might make you feel good. But you need to get out and you need to get some
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.760]   exercise or stay in. I don't care where you do it, but you need to do it.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.120]   That's so true. I have a great friend, John, who's a categorical badass. He was in the
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:13.920]   Foreign Service. He did incredible things for our country. And he's one of those guys. He's like...
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.080]   So he basically does a workout. He eats whatever's in front of him. And he's this brilliant dude.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.520]   But he's like, "The thing is, I have to start with ice baths." And I was like,
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.440]   "This is what I know. Twitter's gone too far."
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.280]   I think you're right. Choose the right games and then optimize for the 10% in everything.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.720]   The interesting thing about... I've talked to lots of people about ice baths, cold plunge.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.000]   There's one aspect of it, which is like, "This is a thing that might help my health."
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.200]   And compared to exercise, maybe it's not there. But there's also the,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.800]   "This is the thing that gets me fired up every day in the morning and makes me feel alert and
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.360]   ready to kick ass on my business, on my work, on my career." And so I put those in 2 camps.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:58.000]   This is the thing that recharges me. This is the thing that helps me recover from run or whatever
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.600]   it is. And then there's the, "Will this increase my longevity? If I'm not exercising, maybe no."
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.760]   But if that ice bath makes you pumped for every day and makes you work
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.920]   10% or 10 times harder, by all means, jump right in.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.280]   Yep. Yep. I agree. We'll stop beating up the poor ice baths. I have one.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:23.520]   But I think... Sorry, ice bath company that gave me one. But I think... I just think...
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:29.760]   I think as humans, if we could really figure out this beautiful secret, which is that we have a
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:36.160]   finite amount of energy and focus is the only thing that matters if you focus on the right
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:43.520]   things first, most humans... I mean, let's be honest. 1 out of 5 people will die... I'm sorry.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   1 out of 10 people in the US will die wealthy when they die. 1 out of 10. Everybody else
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:43:00.240]   inside of there will largely die broke, will die before the age of 60, will be on government
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.520]   subsidization. And so sometimes I try to not forget that, "Man, we have so many different
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.720]   paths in the US." But by and large, we have a lot of people who if we don't overwhelm them,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.800]   and just like when I was younger, and I didn't even know what a mutual fund was,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.920]   and I didn't even know how to not overrun my bank account, but we just make it really easy for them
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.440]   to make one or two right, good decisions, then everything else gets a lot easier.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.560]   But I'm sure the people on your podcast are doing all the right things. So if you guys are here
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.840]   listening, you should probably ice bath and do red light therapy, which I also love.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.440]   Oh, interesting. So I want to go down a handful of paths. One,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.960]   we talked a lot about one aspect of investing that you do and it's become your core thing.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.800]   When it comes to money, are you still doing any other types? Are you diversified or is everything
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.960]   all in on buying businesses? Yeah. No, I'm diversified. I have
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:00.000]   probably a 20% bucket that's stocks, bonds, typical things. I have a financial advisor that
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.480]   manages all of that for me. I probably have another 20% bucket that's startups, early stage
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:13.520]   companies, and then the rest are in either real estate or my boring businesses.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.080]   And that's without leverage. Obviously, if I applied the leverage that I have to the boring
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:26.960]   businesses, it would be maybe 90%, maybe 100% basically. But if we take leverage off the game,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.480]   then I probably am like 55%, 60% in these cash flooring, boring businesses,
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.120]   and the rest of them are in startups or stocks and bonds.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.720]   Okay. And another money thing that I think maybe other people listening, myself included,
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.160]   are thinking is one of the greatest things about running a business, you have all these business
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.360]   expenses, great opportunity to rack up unlimited number of points, miles, cashback, whatever it is.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.840]   Please tell me that you're at least playing that game a little. I know it might not be...
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.040]   You're not as deep as maybe I am, but is that a side benefit to owning all these businesses?
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.160]   I really probably... After me talking about all this, I probably should have just a one-on-one
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.840]   call where you could consult me on my points. No, I think if you looked at my Amex, I probably
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:14.320]   have millions of points that have never used them. And we don't optimize that at all.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.000]   Maybe we optimize a little bit because we have everybody use company cards across all the
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.400]   businesses and those get aggregated in a few different ways. And then we spend some big
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.800]   expenses on that. But for the most part, the benefits or points that I play, the games that
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   I play with that are taxes. So are we buying the right real estate that's going to allow us to do
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:41.040]   accelerated depreciation, amortization? Because that could be a huge benefit.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.960]   Are there some businesses where I could acquire them, but I could acquire them like, "Oh,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:50.880]   this is a fun one." We just bought... So I was out there looking for a head of production.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.000]   I needed somebody to produce part of my media company. And I was having a really hard time
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.440]   finding this role. And I needed actually a few roles underneath it. And I just wasn't
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.320]   having time to hire for it. And so then I was like, "Wait, pause. What if I could acquire
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.720]   these roles that I need in the form of a business, as opposed to hire them?"
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.240]   And so I went out to a few vendors and I started working with a few vendors. And all of those
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.040]   vendors were open to being sold, which will surprise you guys. Almost every single business
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   owner out there is open to being bought at the right price and right terms. And so three of
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.360]   them were open to it. Two of them, I didn't like the deal. One of them, it was perfect timing.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.880]   I had mentioned this to them. They had a little bit of a conflict inside the company.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.680]   And I said to the guy, "Hey, how about if I acquire you guys? How about I buy your company?
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.200]   And I'm going to buy out you four plus your gear. We'll give you some multiple on that.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.880]   But it will happen after you've been with me for 90 days and you've been executing.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.560]   And I'll pay you in salary." So through that acquisition, I have decreased my overall
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   profits in the business by hiring them with an increased salary. But that is a complete
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.000]   before the line tax write-off. Because if I had just bought them... So say I acquire all of them
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.240]   for salary of $100K for the year. Well, I can't write off that acquisition dollar for dollar in
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:15.280]   my business. But if I hire all of them through an acqui-hire, and that $100,000 rolls through as
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   an expense payment for payroll, that lowers the total profits in my business and thus decreases
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.560]   my tax bill dollar for dollar. And so that was a cool way that I sort of gamed my little point
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.320]   system. But no, I'm terrible at Amex cards and flights and all of that stuff.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.000]   We're going to have that one-on-one at some point. We're not going to do it live.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.880]   But we'll get to it. You also mentioned the most important game is to figure out where you spend
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.640]   your time and what you're focused on. How do you think about when to spend your time on certain
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.120]   activities or how you spend your time? I used to be really bad at this. And it's
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.880]   something I struggle with daily. I think I, probably like a lot of entrepreneurs,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:57.760]   have like mild ADHD. Everything's distracting. I have FOMO all the time.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:06.480]   And there are a couple of things that made a big difference. One is, I find that technology,
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.320]   by and large, we think that technology is going to help us. So we have Tinder and Bumble
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.160]   that we're going to save, we're going to make dating so much easier. The world was going to
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.720]   be better because instantly we would be paired with other humans. According to some algorithmic
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.960]   match, we would find love, we would find sex, we would find meaning. What happened instead?
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.280]   Loneliness numbers at all-time high, people having sex at all-time lows,
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.040]   decreased marriage likelihood, decreased people having children.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.360]   This technology that was supposed to help us actually seemingly did not. And in fact,
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:43.760]   through what I think is just massive optionality and overwhelmed from paralysis by analysis,
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.480]   means that we're not engaging anymore in that way from an intimacy perspective.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.240]   I think a lot of the tech that helps us in business is the same thing. Slack is one of
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.120]   the most useful thing in my business. It's also the worst thing in some of my businesses.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.480]   So if you were to look at my calendar, for instance, you would see basically that I do
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:10.400]   not take a phone call before 12pm. I would say I'm not 100% of the time. I am about 70-80% of
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   the time. So no calls before 12. I am 100% of the time before 10am. No phone calls, no meetings.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.400]   You'll also see that we have in our business, we have reminders that go out on our Slack channel
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.080]   that says, "Are you being productive? Are you being busy?" So every so often in the general
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.200]   channel, a thing will come on. And then the people in the companies will be like, "Oh,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.720]   fuck. I am fucking around on Slack. I shouldn't be on here." That's fine.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.520]   And then actually, I met with Bill Perkins, our mutual friend, this last weekend. And he kind of
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:44.080]   messed with my mind, Chris, because we were meeting and he wants me to go big in acquisitions and
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.560]   small business and let him invest in my company. And I don't let anybody invest in me right now.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:54.240]   We have all our own cash in it. And he's like, "Cody, the thing is this." He's like, "You've
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.360]   been investing and playing in small business land for so long. I think small has infected
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:07.200]   your thinking." I was like, "What?" One, ouch, kind of hurt. Two, I rolled it around in my
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.520]   mind for a second and thought, "Huh, he's kind of right." So I was like, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.480]   He's like, "One, you have a portfolio that does $60 million in revenue. That would be a lot to
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.720]   most people." He goes, "But you have run billion dollar funds before. Why don't you have a billion
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.600]   dollars?" I was like, "That's kind of a good question." And then he's like, "Two, how many
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:31.040]   things do you do throughout the day that are not high leverage activities? Count them."
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.240]   And my husband was there with me. And so we started naming off a bunch. And I was like,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:40.000]   "Shut up." Elbowing him beneath the table. And so really quickly, I realized, "Gosh,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.960]   there are all these things where because I didn't come from money, because I still am always scared
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.120]   that I'm going to be broke, because I never feel like we're rich no matter how much money we have,
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   I keep doing that is really holding me back from getting to the next level."
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.360]   And so now I have a question like if you were able to see this here, I have a little question
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.600]   on my computer that says... Well, it says a couple... There's two things. One is about content.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.560]   So it says, "Don't ship a product unless it makes you pee a little bit," which means it should be
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.360]   funny, it should entertain you. Anything that we go out in media. And the second thing basically
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.320]   says, "Long-winded, but does this seem important or is this important?" And so now I try to remind
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.520]   myself of that. Has Bill ever messed with your mind like that? I mean, his whole book messed
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:31.280]   with my mind because I would say played a little bit in that financial independence, retire early
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:37.360]   world. It was all about saving and it really... We were on a call doing an interview and he told me,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.160]   he's like, "When you're trying to use all your points and miles, you're optimizing for the best
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.920]   deal. You're not optimizing for taking the trip." And I left the meeting, went to my wife and I was
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.640]   like, "Why don't we just go on a... We've always talked about going on a trip for the holidays.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.320]   This year is the perfect time. Who cares whether it's going to be a lot of points or not a lot of
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.280]   points. Let's just do it." The awesome part about that was once I committed, then I still found a
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   way to make a great deal. But I was afraid the deal wasn't going to be good because it was the
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.800]   holidays and we weren't going to do it. So he kind of has really messed with my mind,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.000]   which is like, "Stop. Make sure you're optimizing for the right thing."
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.960]   And for anyone who hasn't listened to the episode I did with him on his book,
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.920]   Die With Zero, go back and find it. It was excellent. It might be one of,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.360]   if not the most listened to episode of the show. And so he's really messed with me just like,
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.640]   "Let's make sure I'm really focused on what I want to get out of
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.680]   life in a more broad sense, but not in a business sense."
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.920]   But what he said about your business, all I could think about when we were talking about renting
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.320]   was, "Well, I understand that real estate is an asset class that could be interesting
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.880]   to invest in. I don't want to be a landlord. And so I have some percentage of my portfolio
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.680]   in a REIT. You have convinced me that these opportunities, these millions of small businesses,
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.160]   buying them and running them, operating them, growing them, buying their suppliers,
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.320]   it's a great place to invest time and energy and money. But I also have my own business and I'm
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.160]   like, "Now is not the time with two small kids to do it. How can I... What's the REIT of that?"
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.880]   And it sounds like the answer is there are private equity things which are
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.400]   much more up the high net worth. And in that level of business,
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:16.720]   I wonder if there's as much arbitrage as it sounds like you found. But I also don't necessarily want
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.000]   to do it. Is there a thing in that space or is that what Bill wants you to go do?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.400]   Well, that is what Bill wants us to go do, for sure. But private equity funds
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:31.200]   have varying sizes. What I found is below the $10 million in revenue mark is actually where
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:37.760]   a lot of the meat is still on the bone. Once you get past 10, definitely $20 million in revenue,
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.800]   you're more playing with some of the bigger, lower middle market firms that are buying up some of
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.680]   these companies. But below that, there's just not enough people playing because it's riskier and
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.960]   it's harder to scale. If you think about these companies, KKR, Blackstone, they're not just
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.440]   billions of dollars, they're hundreds of billions of dollars. And it's how much easier is it to
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:06.160]   allocate $100 million once or to 100 deals for $1 million, right? The second is categorically
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.640]   harder to scale than the first. And so because of that, they go up market bigger and bigger and
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.960]   bigger. It's the same reason why in venture, you saw everybody start doing later stage deals,
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:21.760]   right? Because what? You're going to put like 525k checks into a brand new company and hope
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.240]   that something pans out. That's a lot of work. When instead, I could just pick a few companies
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.480]   that are larger, later stage, and I can allocate a bigger chunk. I could put $20 million in it.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.680]   I could put $100 million in it. And so what we're trying to figure out is, is there a way to scale
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   the low end of the totem pole? For most people, though, they don't care. Like for you, you don't
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.480]   care. "Can I scale this to $100 million?" You're like, "How do I pick a couple of businesses where
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:50.400]   I can have an operator that runs this business and I just cashflow on it? I'm like the money,
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.920]   and maybe I'm the counselor once a month, or I'm the strategic advisor quarterly."
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.600]   And that's the real game. So for people who already have a business like you,
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   I would do a couple of things. If I was to tell you, "Chris Hutchins,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.400]   what sort of business should you invest in right now?" I would say, "Chris, take your businesses
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.280]   today and look at all your expenses. Look at every single thing that costs you money each month.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:20.160]   Just throw it in an Excel spreadsheet. Categorize it by who the vendor is. Get rid of the majority."
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:29.520]   So let's call it 60% of the costs are like Amazon, Riverside, stuff that you can't buy.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.040]   And so you're going to get rid of all those. And then you're going to be left with like 20% to 30%
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.760]   to 40%. And you're going to get rid of all the repeat transactions, which means you're probably
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.960]   going to be down to like 10 to 50 different companies. And in those 10 to 50 different
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:52.720]   companies, you're going to look at them and go, "Oh, you know what? I spend $50,000 a month on
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   PPC on ads that I give my vendor for ads. But I have a podcast that gets hundreds of thousands
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:07.200]   of listens a month. And I have a bunch of friends who use paid ads. So what if I go to this guy and
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.240]   say, "Here's the thing. I really like you. Are you going to continue to run that?" And you do that
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.360]   thing that I said to you. You say like, "Would you ever sell the business?" "No, no, no. Most
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.600]   likely this guy is young because paid ads business is newer. So this person is probably a little
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.880]   younger. They're not ready to sell." And so instead you go, "Hey, how about this?
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:33.200]   I'm going to partner with somebody. I'm going to invest in the form of financial return that I
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:40.080]   give you by talking about you on my platform in somebody's paid ads company. I'd like it to be
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.040]   you. I really like working with you. I like us paying you $50,000 a month. And I think that I
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:51.360]   could probably get you another $200,000 a month in paid. Would you be interested if we set it up
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.520]   right? It works out perfectly for you. I get the right terms for you. Would you theoretically be
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.560]   interested in partnering where I do some deal where I take a portion of equity in your company,
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.960]   but that equity distributes as a portion of revenue? So I'm not going to be messing around
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.520]   trying to figure out what your profit is bothering you in the daily. I'm just going to say top line,
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.080]   I'm going to take a percentage of total revenue that we make, and you're going to send it to me,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.000]   just like you would send me a rent check if I was a landlord. Would you be open to something
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.080]   like that?" What you're going to find is like, honestly, I have a high record, but
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:29.200]   somewhere between one to four people that you talk to out of five will be interested in that deal.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   And you're going to structure a deal where you start to own a portfolio of small businesses
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:39.360]   in chunks, because you have a platform that can distribute, and also because you figured out how
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.800]   to get distributed equity deals. And that's what I would do if you, I wouldn't go out and buy a car
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:50.320]   wash, unless alternatively, you have your wife who doesn't want to work 40 hours a week, but she
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:55.360]   would love like a five, 10 hour a week thing that could like be hers and she could make her own
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.960]   money. She could do it her way. Then you could buy a small business too.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:03.920]   I think my wife is more of a business mercenary than I am. So that would not...
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.800]   She would be like, "Let's go buy 50 businesses and I will run that empire." So maybe that's
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.080]   the path. Yeah.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:15.520]   But if someone doesn't own a business, is there like... In real estate, there's like these private
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   real estate deals where you can go in and instead of buying a unit, there's a developer doing this.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:26.000]   Does that stuff exist in businesses? When you buy businesses, do you ever get financing outside?
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.720]   I think you said no, but do other people like you do that?
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.800]   Yeah, totally. I don't do it right now. I use all my own cash. But
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.680]   there are search funds. Those are typically people pull together assets and then
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.200]   find an operator who wants to buy a business. And that operator goes and buys a business and
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:47.120]   use pooled funds. People raise independently for buying businesses. Part of the reason that I
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.680]   started a mastermind group where we talk about all this at Unconventional Acquisitions is because
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:59.120]   I invest in my people's deals. So we have 600 members in there. The average person buys a
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:05.040]   business inside of 11 months that does at least $250,000 in revenue. I invest in a bunch of those
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.240]   deals. So I invest in their one-off deals. I invest in pooled funds like search funds.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.800]   And then there are certainly micro PE funds that'll take...
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.200]   The problem is you really need $25K at least to do that. And a lot of them have $100K minimums.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.360]   But when you're raising for one-off deals, those don't. And the other nice part about
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:29.840]   this is these distribute. When you invest in a VC fund or an angel investment, you know,
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.320]   8 out of your 10 deals you're going to lose money on. And you're not going to get your money for at
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:40.320]   least 5 to 7 years, but more likely 10. And so this one's a little different. I like doing deals
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:44.160]   where I cash flow within the first 30 days, but I'll settle for 90.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.920]   So it sounds like find the places like the community you've built where people are doing
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:52.080]   this. And I think this is the answer for almost any type of industry business that you want to
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.840]   get into. It's go find where the people are talking, whether it's a meetup, whether it's
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.760]   a forum, whether it's a mastermind, and just start talking. And you will slowly build the
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.560]   relationships you need to find ways to get into this. And maybe you'll just decide, "Oh, this is
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   something I want to do." Or "I met someone. They love doing it. I can invest in their next deal."
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:15.040]   Yeah, 100%. And I really just think it's such a skill. I was talking to a guy who owns a really
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.920]   big, maybe one of the largest fitness companies in the country today. And he's like, "I don't
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.400]   even know if I know how to buy businesses." And this guy does almost a billion dollars in annual
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:32.160]   revenue. And I'm like, "Well, it's not that hard. What is it that scares you? Or why don't you
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.600]   think you could do this?" And his comment was, "Well, I've grown so fast organically. It feels
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.360]   scary to me to take my eye off the thing I do every day to try this other thing."
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.520]   And I think that's the other biggest reason why people don't buy businesses. Because you feel like
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.640]   "I don't want to take my eye off podcasting and my business and everything that's working
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.360]   right now. It's a distraction." And that isn't true. Often, if you feel like you're playing,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.160]   let's call it a level one, like a level six game, a really high level game.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.800]   But if you're in a job you don't love, if you're making the same amount of money continuously,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.360]   I think you should spend at least 90 days learning how to acquire things.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:17.680]   Because then you'll never have to do something just for the money again. You can do it if you
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.240]   want to. I don't think everybody should go and be a laundromat owner forever. And that's their
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.520]   highest and best use. But I think if you have assets behind you, then you get to choose.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.640]   You don't have to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's super interesting.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.440]   It's something I never considered until I ran across your content, which is like,
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.040]   "We have to have this conversation because..." I was like, "I just wanted people to know about it."
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:43.920]   We briefly went over life. You talked about your calendar, about how you spend time. Are
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.560]   you a big fan of outsourcing a lot of things to team members, assistants, that kind of stuff?
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.000]   How do you, on the personal side, manage your time and not get caught up in those
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.200]   small questions and focus on what's most important? This one, I've always been pretty good at.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.400]   I think I read the four-hour workweek. I know you're bud, Tim. I think I read that way too
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.520]   early almost. I was like, "I shall outsource everything." But I read that really early,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.640]   and I've tried to live it. It's actually helped a ton. So I've had a VA since I made my first 100K.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.200]   The second I hit 100K, I was like, "Hire a virtual assistant." And now I have a few
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.320]   virtual assistants. And then I have an assistant that manages the first virtual assistants.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.720]   And then I have my chief of staff, who all of them report into. The key though, I think,
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.440]   in delegation is realizing that you can only really have, in my opinion,
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:42.080]   five, max 10 people report to you directly. I think once you get past that 10 direct reports,
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:50.160]   even if the direct report is your nanny, your housekeeper, your property manager,
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.960]   you need those to funnel up. So one thing people don't talk about enough in delegation, I think,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.120]   is that you have to have an org chart for the people that help you even. And this is a higher
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.160]   level game. This is for people who have some disposable income that they can use.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.200]   But if I was you, I actually think the easiest thing to do with delegation is if you can afford
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.640]   to start with a chief of staff. So a higher level person, maybe you're paying that person.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.960]   You could get a young, hungry person for like 65k a year, all the way up to chief of staffs
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.240]   can make hundreds and hundreds of thousands. And that person can be your go-to contact
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.840]   for a VA that only costs you a thousand bucks a month. And for your housekeeper that only costs
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.000]   you 400, 500 bucks a month. But they all go through this one person. That's really the key.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.840]   Because the thing stopping you from getting where you're going is typically you don't have enough
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:55.760]   people working for you. Your 100% can never be as powerful as five people's 50%. So it's a fallacy
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.840]   that if you're great at something, you're the only person who can do it. And simultaneously,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:05.440]   those five people with 50% will distract you hugely. So how can you put a barrier between the
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.200]   two? And so I do that well now, but I haven't always. I have never done it well. And in the
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   last 2 weeks, maybe --I'm very early in this experiment-- I hired a VA. But I would say,
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.880]   based on 2 weeks, I feel like this person falls in the spectrum of VA to chief of staff.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.800]   Way more qualified than just "I'm going to send an email to this person."
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.320]   And they could do all the full spectrum. And this is early. And I worked with a company called
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:44.080]   Oceans. OceansXYZ.com. Feel free to tell them. I say, "Maybe go to allthehacks.com/oceans. And
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.120]   before you hear this, I'll go get some deal. That's my plan. So go to allthehacks.com/oceans,
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:55.200]   and we'll see what I can do." But it has been so interesting to try and really force that.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.440]   And I want to do a whole episode on outsourcing things. And this is not just
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:06.400]   work. This is personal. This is everything from email, to meal planning, to researching,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:13.680]   to so many things that I don't even... But what I did was I started in advance of "Let's go and
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.160]   write down for 2 weeks everything I could outsource." So similarly, as I was going through
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.360]   anything, I just got in my mind, "Okay, could this go out? Okay, I'm putting in a list."
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.800]   Once I saw the magnitude of that list, and if you think about the cost of hiring virtual assistants,
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.520]   you said it could be anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000 a month for a full-time person.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.920]   And there are other options if you want fractional and all that stuff.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:39.440]   Imagine what you could do with that, whether it's spending it just with your family, or on
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:46.400]   really big strategic things with your business. Or maybe you don't have time to buy a small
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.000]   business like you just heard us talk about, because you have so much stuff going on in
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.080]   your personal life. What if you could outsource a lot of that personal life stuff so that you
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.280]   could go and buy a small business and end up finding out that "Net, net, net, this all pays
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.440]   for itself." Now you can roll that person's compensation into that small business.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.600]   Now it's a deductible expense above the line. There's all kinds of interesting stuff. But
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.360]   I am going to do a whole episode on this process of everything we've organized,
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.480]   and how it worked, and how I looked, and all the companies that I interviewed.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.720]   Fancy Hands was by far the worst option for outsourcing tasks. I can do nothing more than
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.080]   wholeheartedly tell you, do not use this company. It was an awful experience.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.920]   I've never heard of that. Really?
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:36.880]   It was just a task-based VA and it was so bad. It was a waste of money. Completely zero value.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:44.080]   Sorry, Fancy Hands. I'm unfortunately completely not satisfied. But I'm incredibly satisfied
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:52.160]   with the woman I'm working with, Promotions. And it's early, but so far, I am so optimistic.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:07:00.560]   I have this friend, Dan, who runs a company called My OutDesk. It's another one of those
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.360]   companies you just talked about. But they do something called the Notepad Challenge.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:11.040]   I gotta find this for you. But basically, he had me do the same thing. So the long and short of it
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:18.320]   is -- and I'll find it so you can link it -- you basically track for an entire day every single
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.600]   activity that you do. And then he says that for a week after, for an hour a day, you should track
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:31.440]   all of your activities that you do. And then you catalog them along a quadrant. And to the left,
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:39.840]   it's like high outcome or high leverage, low time. And on the bottom right, it's low leverage,
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:44.240]   high time. So the bottom would be the worst. Something that takes me a ton of time,
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.040]   and it doesn't have a great outcome for me. And at the top, it takes not a lot of time,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.360]   and it's a great output for me. And the goal is basically, you want to spend all your time
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:08:00.080]   in the left quadrant at the top. Very little of your time in the bottom right. So you want to
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.360]   outsource all of those tasks. And then there'll probably be another quadrant right next to it
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.960]   that's like high output, a lot of time. And maybe -- so you're spending all of your time in the top
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.840]   two. And the bottom two quadrants, you're basically trying to offload all of those tasks.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.920]   And so every so often, I go back and do this version of the notepad challenge.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.320]   And it's really, really helpful. And in the beginning, you do what you can afford,
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:27.840]   and then you layer on top of it. But there's a saying, I can't remember who said it, but that
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.000]   your business is one -- or you are one hire away from a completely new business.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.360]   And I think that's true also of your life. You are one hire away
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.760]   from a completely different life. And it can be very small things. I can't remember the last time
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:51.120]   I had to get on the call with AT&T or Verizon or deal with a cable provider or schedule my doctors.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:58.640]   But six years ago, I spent hours on that stuff, haggling, dealing with issues,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.480]   changing flights. I don't do any of that anymore. And it probably cost me about $1,000 a month to
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:11.680]   save me 10s and 10s and 10s of hours a month. And it's not just hours. It's like the overhead
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.280]   of having to keep track of all of the things. So yeah, I'm a huge fan of that. We're almost
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.000]   out of time. I'm going to ask you one more thing. You have all of these great posts and threads
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.560]   where you're like, "Here's the way I've optimized this aspect of my life." I'm going to mention one,
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.720]   and I'll just link to it in the show notes, which is this 160 rule on Sundays about how you ask
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.040]   yourself and check in on what you're doing. I think it's great. But the one that I was most
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   recently looking at, that's a bit of a tangent from this conversation, was about a check-in you
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.760]   do on your relationship. And so I think maybe as a total aside from everything we've talked about,
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.000]   maybe share that a bit because I adopted it. I thought it was so great.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.960]   Oh, that makes me happy. I had no idea this would go as viral as it did. It's just what we do.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:59.280]   We're busy. My husband works a lot too. He's a pretty serious guy, former Navy SEAL,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.800]   sort of a tough dude. And what was happening is we were building up tension throughout the day.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.880]   So little things, "Why are your socks out? Why didn't you put the car keys away?" Very small
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.640]   things would get blown out of proportion or they would just nag throughout the day. And so we came
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.200]   up with this thing in partnership with this woman called Brandy who helped us called Team. And
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.360]   basically what it is, it's an end of day check-in. And our goal is the little things that come up
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.400]   throughout the day, instead of just word-vomiting them at each other at any given point in which you
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.960]   feel annoyed and you're elevated, what if you wrote them down and you save them for later in
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.040]   a place where maybe you're having a nice glass of wine or for your biohackers out there, you're
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:50.400]   doing whatever you do in the evening and you sit down with your spouse and the first tenant is
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.280]   touch. So T for touch. And it basically means you sit next to each other, you hold hands,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.480]   you put your feet on each other on the couch, whatever. Or when you're really mad,
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.880]   we jokingly do this little ET one-finger touch thing. Because sometimes at the end of the day,
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.200]   you're still mad from what's going on. And you start with touch because you're reminding each
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.920]   other, "You guys are in this together. You're a team." The second step is education. So you know
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.480]   how you come home from work a lot of times and you're like, "How was your day, honey? Good. How
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.840]   was your day, honey?" Like blah, blah, blah. Same conversation. You don't get that deep.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.760]   And that I think really leads to why a lot of people actually get divorced or cheat or whatever.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.280]   You stop dating your spouse and you stop getting the most interesting information out of them
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.240]   because your routine has meant that you ask the same lazy questions always, and you tell
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.040]   lazy stories. And so education means you have to tell your spouse one thing that you learned
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.680]   that day that was new to you. And so that means it's usually a great conversation starter.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.960]   So the education part will usually go longer. So I might be like, "Today I was with Chris,
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.000]   and I just realized that we have a million points on Amex, and now I'm super stressed because we
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.760]   have never used these. And so now I have to figure out how to optimize this. And did you know that
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.960]   there's a whole group of people that this is all they do and we're not doing it?" So maybe that's
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.440]   my thing. And then he'll tell me something. And then the next is appreciation. So even
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.520]   when you're mad, there is a reason why you chose this human to be with for life, for now, for
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.360]   whatever. And so giving a little piece of gratitude typically helps diffuse what comes next. And so
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.920]   if you're mad, it could be, "I appreciate you taking out the trash today."
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.640]   Our only rule there is you can't keep repeating the same ones. "You're so beautiful. I love your
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.400]   hair." No, you got to get a little bit more creative. And then the last one is metrics.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.200]   And here we basically say, "I kept my list of things that annoyed me today that I wish you
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.400]   would do differently." Or, "Here's this big thing that I want us to talk about." Or some days we
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.480]   really have nothing. But because you're not telling the person in the moment when you're upset at them
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:56.400]   about this thing, the level of intensity, emotional intensity is so decreased that typically we get
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.040]   through the metrics in a way where we're in our rational brains. We're not elevated. And so we can
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.560]   have a really pretty easy conversation. And then the internet has actually changed up this one a
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.720]   little bit. And they now think it is Teams. And at the end, it should be "Ask for sex."
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.280]   And that's how you should add it. So up to you. That's an optional add-on at the end.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.320]   Alright. So I know that was a departure, but I think you have a few of these. I'm going to link
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.280]   to a couple of the other ones that you've done where you're just like, "Hey, here's the way I've
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.840]   optimized this thing in my life." And what I love about having conversations with people that have
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.560]   thought very deeply about one area of their life is they've generally actually done that
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.720]   other places. The hardest thing that I... You create content, so it's a little easier,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.680]   but the hardest thing for me is pulling it out. Because they don't always think...
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.880]   Maybe before you made that post, you said you didn't think it would go viral. It's like,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.680]   "Well, it's just a thing I do." It's like, "No, you've applied all these lessons you've learned
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.000]   about business relationships and tracking things and trying to find this way. Oh, let's just apply
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.320]   it to this relationship." And it turned out amazing. Not to say just this relationship,
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.280]   the most important relationship, of course. That's right.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.480]   But yeah, so that was awesome. Thank you for sharing that. I'll link to the rest.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.600]   We're way over time. Where can people go and learn more about everything you're
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.760]   doing in your community about buying businesses, follow you, everything?
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   I think ContraryThinking.co is probably the best or I'm @CodySanchez on all those socials.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.000]   Take your pick. But I think the free newsletter comes out weekly and is awesome if you want to
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.200]   learn 2 things. Mental frameworks, and you want to learn monetary frameworks. So how to make money,
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.040]   and how to think better. That's Contrary Thinking's newsletter.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.360]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.160]   Thank you for having me. This is a blast. Got to get my points now.
