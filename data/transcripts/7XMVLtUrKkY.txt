[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:14.560]   the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, in chapter 9, reading verses 23 and 24.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.080]   The book of the Prophet Jeremiah, chapter 9, reading verses 23 and 24.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.440]   Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise men glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:40.240]   men glory in his might; let not the rich men glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:52.480]   glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.240]   kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.800]   For in these things I delight, saith the Lord.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.320]   Now I call your attention to these words, these striking and momentous words, uttered
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.480]   by the Prophet Jeremiah as the mouthpiece of God, in order that we may consider together
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.920]   the whole problem of life and of living.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   That is the business of a service such as this.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.800]   This is not just some kind of society where men and women at their leisure and out of
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.560]   some general interest meet together to consider certain subjects and questions.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.240]   That is not the position.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.000]   The whole purpose of a meeting such as this is that we may consider together the whole
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.360]   problem of life and of living.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.480]   This is always something that is necessary, but in days and times like these, with the
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.880]   world as it is, it is more necessary than ever.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.160]   Now we began doing this very thing last Sunday night.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.800]   Surely this is the thing to which we must give ourselves, I say with a new urgency,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.080]   at a critical and a difficult moment like this.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.160]   Because it is obvious that there is something tragically wrong with men and with the world
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.080]   as a whole.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.200]   And the business of this book called the Bible is to bring us to see the cause of their trouble,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.920]   and then to lead us to the only solution to the problem.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.640]   Now there are many different ways in which men show this tragic condition in which he
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.080]   is to be found.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.360]   Last Sunday night we were looking at the case of people who just contract out of life altogether,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.680]   or at least who think that they can do so.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.720]   We were looking at that incident in the 18th chapter of the book of Judges, where we read
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.760]   a story about those Zydonians who went off on their own to build a sort of dream city,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.960]   where there was no law, no magistrate, no hindrances and encumbrances of that type and
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.320]   kind, and who thought fondly that they'd really made a perfect world for themselves,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.400]   but suddenly found that it all went and vanished, and they themselves with it.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.960]   Now that was a picture of so many modern men and women who think that they can contract
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.720]   out of life, not really face it at all, but just have their supposed good time, and make
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   this little world for themselves.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   Well, we saw, I think clearly and plainly, what a ridiculous, what a futile attitude
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.520]   that is.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.200]   But it isn't the only one.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360]   It isn't the only fallacy with respect to life that is being manifested at this present
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   time.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.040]   Now here in this little paragraph that we're looking at together here in the ninth chapter
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.320]   of the book of the prophet Jeremiah, in just two verses, we are given another picture of
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.520]   another group of people, another type of person, who would have ridiculed the matter that we
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.840]   were looking at last Sunday night, and would have said that it was patently wrong, and
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.160]   obviously quite ridiculous.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.400]   But though they can see through the fallacy of that, they cannot see that they're in an
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.640]   equally fallacious position.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.160]   But here the prophet, I say, is the mouthpiece of God, who calls them to realize the futility
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.960]   of their position and of what they are doing.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Now what was their fallacy?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.760]   Well, here you see the fallacy is a different one.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   Here it is this extraordinary fallacy of turning to and confiding in false expedients and solutions.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.700]   The people we looked at last Sunday night were not interested in solutions at all.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.700]   They just didn't think.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.400]   They just went off to have their good time.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   Here we are dealing with people who do think, but who've come to the wrong conclusion, and
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.480]   are putting their confidence and their faith, I say, in false expedients and solutions to
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.040]   the problem and the battle of life.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.200]   Now again, we must note this point in passing.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.820]   There's nothing new here, is there?
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.980]   This prophet Jeremiah wrote about eight centuries before the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.980]   Christ.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.680]   But you notice the things against which he had to warn his contemporaries.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.740]   Let not the wise men glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty men glory in his might,
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.700]   let not the rich men glory in his riches.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now that was necessary as a message all that long time ago, very nearly twenty-eight centuries.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.200]   And yet you see, it's as necessary tonight as it was then.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.480]   For these are the very things to which the modern man is turning, and on which he relies.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   I've got to make this point.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.480]   It's a fundamental one in biblical teaching.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.400]   Man does not change at all.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.880]   Human nature is tonight what it was in the days of Jeremiah, what it has always been
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.800]   ever since the fall of man from the very dawn of history.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   Man doesn't change.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   There he was then, trusting to these three things.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.200]   He's trusting to the same three things even at this very moment.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.760]   Man doesn't change, but thank God the message doesn't change either.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   And of course he doesn't need to.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.360]   As the problem of man is the same, so he needs the same message.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.800]   And the message of God in this old book is as up-to-date and as relevant this evening
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.200]   as it was so many long centuries ago.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.600]   Very well then, let's look together at what the prophet has to say to his contemporaries.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   They were in trouble as we are in trouble.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.040]   Their whole world had become very insecure.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.720]   Things had gone wrong in Israel in every respect, not only religiously but morally particularly,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.920]   and even in a military sense.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.200]   The Chaldeans were gathering together a great army and were on the point of attacking Jerusalem.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.600]   The position was terribly uncertain.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   At any moment the enemy might come, and eventually of course he did come, because they wouldn't
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.760]   listen to the warning of the prophets.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.680]   Well very well, there is their position.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.240]   Why are they in that position?
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   The prophet tells them.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.820]   And I am here to suggest to you that it is the same message precisely that is needed
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.160]   by this world tonight, whether in general or in particular.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.360]   It is a message that comes to every individual in the world at this moment.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.400]   So let me put the question.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.160]   Why is the world in trouble?
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.320]   What is the cause of this human tragedy that is so obvious in the world at this moment?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.080]   I am not only thinking of the international tension and all the terrible possibilities
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.720]   that are there.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.880]   I am thinking of it as it is manifesting itself in the social life of the people in every
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.160]   country.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.000]   All the trouble and the anguish and the pain and the confusion.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.400]   What is the cause of it all?
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:46.080]   Why is the world tonight so tense, feeling this awful strain, fearful, knowing that what
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   is going to happen?
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.960]   Well the answers are here quite simply.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.880]   Let me just hold them before you.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.640]   The first cause of all this, according to the prophet here, is that man glories in and
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   places his ultimate confidence in himself.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   That is the first cause of the trouble.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.920]   That man glories in himself and puts his final confidence in himself and in his own powers.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   Now you notice that Jeremiah says, "Let not the wise men glory in his wisdom."
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   Yes, but you notice it is his wisdom.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.320]   He is not so much glorying in the wisdom or in the might or in the riches as the fact
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.200]   that they are his, that they belong to him, that they are a part of him, that he possesses
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   them.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:41.720]   In other words, the radical trouble and the cause of all our ills is this fatal self-confidence
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.680]   of man.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.440]   Man has always believed, since he went wrong and departed from God, that he could deal
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.520]   with the problems of life and of his world.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.040]   He is quite confident that he needs no help.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.640]   This is, according to the Bible, man's essential trouble.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.360]   He feels that he is autonomous, doesn't need anything outside himself, doesn't need a God,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.640]   doesn't need a lawgiver.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   He's autonomous.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.960]   He is self-sufficient.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.680]   And because he feels that he's autonomous and self-sufficient, he is always self-satisfied.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.600]   In other words, he believes that by the exercise of his own powers and his own abilities, he
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:34.040]   can cope with the situation, he can deal with the problem, and he can solve it in a satisfactory
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.960]   manner.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:44.040]   So he looks at himself, and he glories in himself, and he is proud of his powers.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.680]   Now that's the word that the Prophet uses, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom."
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.360]   He does glory in it.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   He's proud of it.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.280]   And this is typical of the modern man.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.000]   Never has man been more proud of his own wisdom than he is at this present hour.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.880]   He's arrived, he thinks.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.040]   He's got knowledge.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   He's got learning.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.000]   He's got understanding such as no previous generation has ever had.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.360]   And he's proud of it.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.160]   The modern man is tremendously proud of his own learning and wisdom and understanding.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.280]   He glories in it.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.600]   And in his power, and the way he's able to use and to handle power, and in his riches,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.440]   and in his wealth, he glories in it.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.800]   He looks at himself and these things that he possesses.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   And he boasts of it.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   He's proud of it.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.480]   He glories in it.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.120]   He exalts in it.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.280]   And of course, he places a final confidence in it.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   Now that, I say, is the essential cause of all man's troubles.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.560]   It's a very subtle one.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.760]   And it's a subtle one for this reason.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.440]   That there is value in these things in which men glories.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.560]   Well where is the trouble then?
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.720]   Oh the trouble is this.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.440]   That man doesn't use them properly.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.040]   He doesn't regard them in the right way.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:13.640]   The trouble is that man, in his blindness as the result of sin, turns into absolutes
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   what are really only relative.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:23.040]   Or if you prefer it, he makes masters of what were meant to be servants.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   Now that's the trouble.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.320]   Now let me show you what I mean.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.280]   Take wisdom.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.480]   Let not the wise men glory in his wisdom.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.520]   Well does that mean, says somebody, that there's anything wrong with wisdom?
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.840]   Is it a part of the preaching of the Christian faith to say that wisdom is no good?
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.720]   That a man has to commit intellectual suicide?
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.960]   That a man has to throw all his books overboard or burn them?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.120]   And that the ignoramus is really the man whom God delights in?
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.840]   Does Christianity put a premium upon ignorance and darkness and lack of knowledge?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.400]   Well of course it doesn't.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.520]   Well what's wrong you say?
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.960]   Well what's wrong is this.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.360]   Wisdom in and of itself, wisdom stands for knowledge and for learning and the ability
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.480]   to think and all these things.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.640]   Wisdom in and of itself is a most noble and a most excellent thing.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   God has given men the gift of reason.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.400]   It's a part of God's self.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.440]   It's a part of God's image in men, that he has this ability to think and to reason and
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.240]   to sift evidence and to weigh and to measure and so on and to arrive at decisions and to
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.680]   consider himself.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.040]   Wisdom is a most wonderful thing and a most excellent thing.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.960]   And of course the whole story of civilization is in a sense the story of the men using and
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   employing this gift of wisdom which God has given them.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.600]   Now all this is perfectly right.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.120]   And all the best benefits that we are enjoying in this life and in this world tonight have
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.360]   come to us as the result of this wisdom.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.440]   It is by using his brains and knowledge and understanding that man has been able to discover
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.360]   so many of the secrets of nature, has been able to harness them and turn them to his
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.600]   own advantage and to his own good.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.760]   And everything about that is absolutely right and good.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.780]   It's the same with great literature, great art, great music, all these things are excellent
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.240]   in and of themselves.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.200]   Well what's wrong then, says someone?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.640]   Well you see what's wrong is this, that instead of using wisdom in that way as our
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.400]   servant and as something that can give us many benefits and help us in so many ways,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.600]   man has turned wisdom into a kind of God.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:40.000]   He puts his faith in wisdom, he worships wisdom, he glories in wisdom, he says my wisdom is
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   enough.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He's dominated by his own wisdom, he bows down before it, he glories in it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.160]   In other words, he has turned what was meant to be a servant into something that has become
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.520]   a master.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.760]   It's exactly the same thing with this strength or this might to which he refers.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.260]   There's no need to waste your time over this.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.000]   It is because of this might and this power that man again has been able to do so many
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.640]   wonderful things.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.200]   Power again is something that comes out in the great record of history, the mighty things
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   that have been done.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.720]   Well, it's all right, it's a God-given power and faculty.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   Well what's wrong?
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:29.040]   Well it's exactly the same thing once more, that man worships it, boasts of it.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.080]   Nearly all the great empires that history has ever known have done this very thing.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.480]   Having achieved a certain position, they begin to bow down to themselves and to worship themselves.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.280]   There's a great illustration of it in the Old Testament, a man called Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.880]   He thought he was a god.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.160]   He began to worship his own might and power and wisdom.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.840]   He was a very great man, but the moment he begins to worship it, he becomes a fool.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.120]   Now that's what man's doing.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   Let's be honest, this country has done it in the past.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.920]   That's what they're doing the other side of the Iron Curtain tonight.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.200]   The strong, they're holding up their mail fist, they're threatening.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.640]   That's worshipping might and power.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   And it's done by men in almost every realm and department of life.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   Individuals do it.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   They use their power.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.880]   Power is a good thing, but once you let it become a master, it's a terrible thing.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   It's like fire.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.080]   Fire is a good servant, but a bad master.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.720]   Look what you can do with fire.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.600]   Heat your house, warm your hands, cook your meals.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.240]   Fire is an excellent servant.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.400]   But you let your house get on fire, and fire becomes master.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.160]   And it always leads to catastrophe and devastation.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.320]   And it's exactly like that with all might and power that is given to men and that is
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.920]   known of men.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.360]   Most of the troubles in the world tonight are due to this.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.840]   You see, there was a time when all the power was in the hands of the masters, and the men
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.020]   had no power and they groveled.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.880]   And it was tyranny, it was unfair.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.320]   But we're beginning to witness the exact opposite today.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.360]   Direct action, forcing governments and countries to do certain things.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   Why?
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.920]   Well, because they've got the whip-end, as they think.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.720]   Whenever power becomes the master, it is quite wrong.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.680]   And to glory in power, and to rely upon your power, and to think there's nothing like you
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.160]   have power, it always leads to calamity.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.120]   And exactly, of course, the same is true of riches.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.840]   Money is a very useful commodity.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.400]   And you can do many things with money and with wealth and with riches.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.660]   There's nothing wrong in the thing itself.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.220]   But it becomes wrong when men begin to worship it, when they begin to rely upon it, when
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.100]   they begin to think that there's nothing it cannot do.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.100]   Money is power.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.260]   And a man feels that because he's got this wealth, there's nothing he cannot do.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.900]   He relies, he glories in it, he boasts of it, places his final confidence in it.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.360]   That's the thing that is denounced.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:58.060]   And that is how I say, you see, the subtlety of all this.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:06.400]   That men has turned the servants into masters, or has allowed the servants to become masters,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.680]   and they dominate him and they control him.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.340]   And here he is fondly imagining that all is well.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.900]   He says, "There are troubles, what's it matter?
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900]   My wisdom.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.020]   There are troubles, doesn't matter, my might's going to see me through.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020]   What's it matter?
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.280]   I'll buy my way through this.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.940]   My wealth is going to do it."
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.940]   That's the tragedy.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:29.300]   And now that is in various forms and ways the whole essence of the human tragedy at
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.780]   this very moment, this evening.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.980]   Can't you see it operating on all levels?
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   Between countries, between blocks of countries, within countries, in the various divisions,
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.300]   capital and labor, and all these things.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:50.660]   All the havoc that is in the world tonight because men, in some way or another, are glorying
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.380]   in wisdom or might or riches.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.660]   That's the first cause of the trouble.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:03.780]   It's all a form, as I'm indicating, of men's self-adulation, self-worship, autonomous men,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   men self-sufficient.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.980]   Men's got all that's necessary, and with these powers he's going to solve the problem.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.780]   There is the essence of the trouble.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.280]   But let me put this in a second form.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:23.100]   It is, I say, because men in that way glories in himself and puts his final confidence in
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:31.340]   himself that he gets himself and his world into trouble so constantly, then, now, always.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:38.480]   But that, you see, indicates a second thing, that men clearly fail to realize his own inadequacy
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:46.740]   and his own inability and the consequent insufficiency of these very things on which he tends to
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   rely.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.340]   Now, here is the urgent matter.
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.620]   This is, I say, the cause of the trouble.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.620]   It's tragic tonight.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.820]   To me, this is the greatest tragedy of all.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.260]   It's much a greater tragedy than the fact that they've got those bombs.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.940]   This is the tragedy, that anybody should be relying on such things or relying that they
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.060]   are able to deal with that problem in some shape or form in and of themselves.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.060]   That's what they do.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:19.340]   Now, what I say is truly amazing is this, that it is at all possible for anybody to
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.700]   do that at this present hour.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.420]   Now, they were doing it in Israel of old.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.860]   Though everything had gone wrong and the enemy was coming, they still trusted in these things,
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.700]   and the Prophet has to warn them.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:38.500]   And this is a part of men's essential blindness as the result of what the Bible calls sin.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:46.100]   Man goes on trusting in himself and in his own powers and in his own ability in spite
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.660]   of the great lesson of history.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.940]   What is the great lesson of history?
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.940]   It's this.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.100]   It is the failure of doing this very thing.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.740]   There is history proclaiming how foolish this is.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.140]   There are all the biographies attesting the same thing, but still men go unbelieving in
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.140]   it.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:09.100]   But still more astonishing is this, that in spite of the fact that the world is as it
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.380]   is tonight, men are still relying upon these very things.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:20.020]   Even now, on the brink of the inferno, on the brink of final calamity, men are still
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.580]   trusting to these things.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:27.900]   Here in this mid-twentieth century, with the world in flames as it were tonight round and
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:33.580]   about us, man still is putting his faith into these things.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.940]   It's almost incredible.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   Why does he do so?
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.680]   Well, I say there is only one answer.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.540]   It is because he doesn't realize the true nature of the problem confronting him.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.260]   It's because he's never awakened to the inadequacy of the things to which he trusts.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.980]   Listen, "Thus saith the Lord, let not the wise men glory in his wisdom, neither let
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.980]   the mighty men glory in his might.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.140]   Let not the rich men glory in his riches."
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.140]   Why?
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.620]   Well, because they're inadequate, because they're insufficient, because they cannot
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.880]   solve the problem.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.100]   Are we clear about that?
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.140]   These people were not clear.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.060]   I suggest the world is not clear tonight.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]   Are you clear, my friend?
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.140]   Well, let's look at them one by one.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.140]   Take wisdom.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.180]   "Don't glory in your wisdom," says God.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.180]   Why not?
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.820]   Wisdom, surely, says someone, is an excellent thing.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.180]   Well, I've agreed, it is.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.680]   It's a wonderful gift.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.500]   It's the highest gift that man has.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.340]   And I'm not here to disparage it or to say a word against it in any shape or form, but
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.900]   I am here to say that if we glory in it and trust in it and rely upon it, we are nothing
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   but fools.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   Why?
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:59.180]   Well, because of the obvious limits to wisdom, because of the things that wisdom cannot do.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.660]   What is it that wisdom cannot do?
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.660]   Well, here are some of the things it can't do, and they're the most important things
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.820]   in life.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.260]   Wisdom can discover many secrets of the universe and can harness them.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.500]   It can bring in its wonderful inventions.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.380]   It can make life much more comfortable and much easier for all of us.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.580]   All right, excellent, but you know, here's the sort of thing that wisdom can't do.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.180]   It can't enable a man to know himself.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.060]   Now that was the great phrase of the philosophers, the people who believed in wisdom above everybody
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.780]   else, those Greek philosophers to whom Paul was referring in writing there in his epistle
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.060]   to the Corinthians.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.820]   They were the philosophers, the believers in wisdom.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.540]   And this was the great word of the philosophers, "Know thyself."
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.700]   They said that's the most important thing in the world, is for a man to get to know
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.700]   himself.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.420]   And they were absolutely right, of course.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:55.700]   But here's the tragedy, that their philosophy couldn't enable a man to do that.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.140]   Philosophy is very good at posing questions, and the questions need to be posed.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.860]   Yes, but you and I, we don't want simply to get people to pose questions to us.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.020]   What you and I need to know is the answer to the question.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.780]   Know thyself.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.620]   And this is the tragedy, that philosophy cannot answer that question.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.740]   It doesn't know.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.940]   Ask your great philosophers tonight, "What is man?" and they don't know.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.900]   They don't know about the true nature of man.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.020]   They don't know about the essential greatness of man.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.300]   They think he's just an animal who's developed a little more cerebrum than the other animals.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.540]   That's their view of men.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.300]   And it's because they think things like that, that the world is as it is.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.900]   The philosophers tell us that we're all but animals.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.220]   They shouldn't be surprised, therefore, if most people are behaving like animals.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.340]   They're encouraging them to do so.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.900]   They say that a man has got these drives within him, these desires.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.740]   Well, they're obviously there for some purpose, and they're meant to be used.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.140]   Why shouldn't he use them?
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.460]   Very well, people are listening to them, and they're using them, hence the chaos in life.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.460]   And the philosophers themselves, many of them, are doing the same thing, and are even giving
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.660]   a lead in their prospect.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.620]   Always check what a philosopher teaches by his life and by his record.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.860]   It's very illuminating.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.180]   They don't understand men.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.020]   They don't know men's true and essential greatness.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.980]   They don't likewise know men's real object and purpose in this world.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980]   What's he here for?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980]   And they don't know.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.780]   You read their books.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.020]   Life to them is just an accident.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.060]   It all started as an accident.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.220]   There's no plan, they say.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.980]   There's nothing here at all.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   Things just happen.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   Man's just something that's happened.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.100]   Well, hasn't he got a great destiny?
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.700]   Not at all.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.020]   He lives here and has all these troubles.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.020]   He dies.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020]   That's the end of it.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.020]   And on and on it goes.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.020]   There's no purpose.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.020]   There's no object.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:55.620]   Philosophy, wisdom can't tell you about men and his own greatness and glory and the purpose
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.660]   of life and living and existence.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.180]   But in the same way, it doesn't know men's real need.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:08.020]   They think his need is to have more knowledge, more learning, more understanding, more scientific
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   inventions.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.180]   Well, we've had a great number, haven't we, in this present century, but things far from
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.980]   getting better seem to be getting worse.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.380]   What is men's need?
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.900]   They don't know.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.460]   And in any case, you see, when they say more knowledge, more learning, so many of us haven't
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.620]   got the brains to take it in.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.980]   What's to happen to us?
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.980]   No answer.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.980]   Nothing at all.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.300]   Nothing for the poor, nothing for the ignorant, nothing for those who don't understand the
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.540]   categories and the terms of their brilliant philosophies.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   Nothing.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.540]   Emptiness.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.540]   Bankruptcy.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.780]   You see, wisdom can't supply this great need.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:46.460]   But not only that, wisdom doesn't even give us an explanation of why the world is as it
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.660]   is tonight.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.300]   Isn't that one of the first things we want to know?
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.700]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.500]   And your wisdom, your human philosophy can't tell you.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.420]   It doesn't know.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.500]   It has argued and argued very loudly for a hundred years that if only you educated people
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.780]   more and if only you made them travel more and meet one another more, that there'd never
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.900]   be war any longer, that war was due to ignorance and people not meeting with one another.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.020]   The more we meet together, the more we love one another.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.860]   The more we know, the more we'll banish war.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.140]   We've done the exact opposite.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.340]   They don't understand.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.500]   They really don't know what's the matter with the world tonight.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.900]   They're baffled and utterly bewildered.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.460]   They think it's madness.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.780]   So wisdom fails there again.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.380]   Not only that, you see, wisdom doesn't help us at all in this whole problem of personal
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.140]   living, personal daily life.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.140]   What are the problems?
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.980]   Well, my friend, your main problems in this world and mine are these.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.620]   How to live a clean, a pure, an honest and an upright life.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.960]   How to resist temptation and evil.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.300]   How to maintain a certain chastity with which you were born.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.100]   These are the problems.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.080]   And here, wisdom doesn't help you at all.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.580]   The Apostle Paul has said the final word about this in the seventh chapter of his great epistle
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   to the Romans.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.860]   "With my mind," he says, "I delight in the law of God.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.980]   But I find another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.220]   Yes, I know what I ought to do, and I even want to do it, but I can't do it.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.180]   I'm paralyzed by something else."
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.620]   Your wisdom doesn't help you.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.020]   "Tell the people," they say, "about the evil effects of drink, and they'll stop drinking."
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   Do they?
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.780]   "Give them instruction on morality and venereal disease, and they'll be moral."
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.980]   Will they?
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   Does knowledge deliver?
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.060]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.500]   Some of the men who impart the knowledge of the greatest slaves to the very things against
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.740]   which they're warning us.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.860]   To know that a thing is bad doesn't stop a man doing it.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.260]   Wisdom is excellent as far as it goes, but it can't solve this moral problem.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.820]   The philosophers have been some of the greatest failures.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:05.220]   That's why you shouldn't glory in wisdom.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.500]   It fails to deal with all the greatest and most fundamental problems of life.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.100]   Take another, to know God.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.460]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.900]   It had tried very hard before Christ came.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.140]   Your greatest philosophers had all come and gone before the birth of Christ, and they'd
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.940]   got a long way.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.900]   Let me give them that credit, but they hadn't got there.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   They didn't know him.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.700]   He was an unknown God, and all your wisdom and knowledge will never bring you to this.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   He's beyond it.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.860]   He's above it.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:43.460]   And it doesn't teach us how to face the end of all things and how to die.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.180]   Human wisdom knows nothing about death.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.140]   It doesn't understand it.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.020]   It just has to turn its face to the wall and go out as best it can.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.580]   Its highest achievement was stoicism, a kind of courage, a manly courage, though you don't
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   know.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.580]   But that's no solution.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.580]   That's resignation.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   That's giving in.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.580]   That's really just putting up with things.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.580]   That's no solution.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.660]   Well, now, you see, without my keeping you further, here are some of the reasons why
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.300]   you shouldn't glory in wisdom.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.140]   Isn't it sheer madness that the world tonight should be trusting to its own wisdom and knowledge
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.300]   and understanding when it patently cannot deal with the vital problems, the most urgent
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.980]   matters that are before us?
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.740]   And exactly the same is true about might.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.220]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.300]   "Again, I say that might in and of itself is quite all right, but when a man begins
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.820]   to glory in it, he just shows that he's a fool.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.580]   A very wise man wrote a book of Proverbs, which is in the Old Testament, and he said
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.580]   a thing like this.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:46.420]   He says, 'Greater is he that controleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.'
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.660]   He says, 'A man who can control his own temper is a greater man than the man who conquers
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.900]   another city and captures it from an enemy.'
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   Why?
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.260]   You see, this is something that history surely should have shown to us very plainly.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.260]   What is there greater than might?
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.860]   Well, there are many things I suggest to you which should persuade us not to put our final
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.620]   confidence in might.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.620]   What is history?
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:16.020]   Well, in a way, it's nothing but a great fight between brains and brawn.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.540]   And you see, we are living in an age when we are seeing this increasingly.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.940]   There was an age when men used to fight their battles personally, and personal chivalry
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.380]   and valour and courage counted tremendously.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.220]   In an age in which you fight by pressing buttons, that doesn't help very much, does it?
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.940]   It's cleverness you need now, it's ingenuity, it's inventive capacity.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.500]   It's the men who can get that rocket first.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   Brains against brawn.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.340]   And so your great massive battleships are obsolete.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.260]   With all their power, they're absolutely useless.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.260]   One man presses a button, that's the end of your great and mighty dreadnought.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.500]   Brains against brawn.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.420]   I'm putting it in modern language.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.080]   The Bible puts it in the story of David against Goliath.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.500]   This colossus that stood defying the armies of the living God, he takes them all on together.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:09.100]   And this stripling of a boy comes with just a sling and a stone, and one of them finishes
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.220]   the great mighty power.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.260]   Brains against brawn.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.060]   What a fool is the man who trusts in might and who glories in it.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.900]   Quite apart from that, of course, it's something that gets less and less as you get older and
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.220]   older.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.180]   All power tends to wane and to vanish and to disappear, appear every day.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.940]   You're older, you've got that much less energy and vital power and ability.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.340]   Not only that, it's attacked by various forces.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.260]   Illness comes and your strong man is thrown down in utter helplessness and weakness.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.260]   The thing is laughing.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.260]   Look at that strong man.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:52.380]   And I'm told there's a little virus which is so small that you can't see it under the
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.380]   most powerful microscope.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.380]   It's ultra-microscopic.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.860]   It's so small that it passes through the most delicate filters that man has ever made,
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.420]   the virus of influenza.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:08.420]   And yet when it attacks that giant of a man, it knocks him down as if he were nothing.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.620]   Let not the mighty man glory in his might.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.740]   There are powers and forces that can come along and suddenly smite him and it's all
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.740]   gone.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.300]   And think of the other things that arise.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.380]   Isn't this again the story of history?
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.940]   Look at the great and mighty all-conquering nation.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.820]   Yes, but it doesn't last very long, does it?
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.100]   Read your Old Testament history, my friends.
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.100]   It's very salutary.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.100]   It does us a lot of good.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.300]   You'll see great empires coming up one after another, thinking that at last they were the
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.700]   world conquerors and they'd remain there.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.180]   But another suddenly comes up and down they go.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.180]   He does the same thing.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.420]   Down he goes.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.100]   Read the book of Daniel and you'll see them falling like nineties.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:52.020]   This is the story of the nations, the empires.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.220]   There are these powers that come and attack the mightiest and the strongest, and in a
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.740]   spiritual sense, don't you see it?
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.580]   What's the point of talking about and glorying in your might when you realize there is one
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:11.860]   called the devil, the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   the children of disobedience?
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.860]   You're but putty in his hands.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.580]   You're nothing.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   And then think, my friend, of pitting yourself against the power of God, the almighty everlasting
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.580]   God.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.260]   You say, "I don't believe in this nonsense.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.180]   I'm going to throw life on my feet."
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.180]   Are you?
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.660]   You're pitting yourself against the rock of ages.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:42.500]   You're standing up against the God of the universe, and your might is nothing.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:48.220]   But then I say, I remind you again when you think that you're strong and are glorying
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:56.540]   and bursting in your might and power, look at that specter that is approaching with a
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.660]   scythe in his hand, who is he?
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:06.980]   He's death, wielding his scythe and slaying men, all conditions and kinds, the power of
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   death.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:16.260]   Let him that is mighty not glory in his might.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.220]   And it's exactly the same with riches.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.860]   Let not the rich man glory in his riches.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.860]   Why?
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.300]   Money's power, says the world.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   Is it?
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.780]   Is money really power?
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.180]   Oh, up to a point I know it is.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.980]   It can do many things, but there are some things it can't do.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.660]   Here are some of them.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:42.100]   Money is a very powerful and a very useful commodity, but it can't buy happiness.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.260]   It can't buy peace.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.100]   It can't even buy health.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.180]   It can't buy wisdom.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.460]   It can't buy love.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.340]   It can't buy true life.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:02.180]   Have you read the confessions of the book about the wealthiest men in the world tonight?
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.860]   The wealthiest men in the world, but what a poor man.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   He can't find love.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.780]   He's been married five times.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.980]   He can't find married love, he says.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   He admits it.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:16.460]   Glorying in your might, in your money, what's the point of it?
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:21.900]   It can't buy the most precious, the most wonderful thing in life apart from this gospel, the
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:29.460]   love of a person, married bliss, the enjoyment of a home life, to be surrounded by your family.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.460]   It knows nothing about it.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   It can't purchase it.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.060]   And the same I say with peace and with health and all these things, and then again there
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.580]   are the same dangers.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.940]   Listen to our Lord on this.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:47.020]   Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, he says, where moth and rust are corrupt and
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.100]   thieves break through and steal.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.100]   There are these corroding influences.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.180]   What are you like if you lose your money?
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.060]   If you've been living on it, what have you got left?
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.980]   But there are always these things that are threatening you and you never know when they
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:11.300]   come and the things that you buy are of no value to you in the hour of trial.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.260]   And that brings me to the last trial.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.700]   In this modern atomic world, what's the value of wealth?
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.020]   Is there any difference between the wealthiest men in the world and the poorest men in the
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.220]   world?
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.340]   When that button is pressed and that bomb goes off, there's none at all, no difference
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.900]   whatsoever.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:40.340]   Face to face with death in the end, money is valueless and useless.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.380]   Let me put it again in the words of our Lord.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:50.020]   What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.100]   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.420]   He says, here's my wealth, here's my bank balance, here are my possessions.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.500]   No good.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.220]   It can't do instead of the soul.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.500]   It's of no value.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.260]   What shall it profit a man?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.220]   Nothing, nothing at all.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:15.300]   Here then I say is man's second manifestation of his tragic folly.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.100]   That he doesn't realize the nature of his problem, he's relying on things that are totally
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.700]   inadequate to help him at that point.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:28.300]   His self-confidence is utterly misplaced, his reliance upon his faculties is something
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.060]   that is nothing but sheer folly and tragic folly.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.140]   They're inadequate to meet the greatest needs.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.700]   But come to the third and the last point.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:47.060]   Man's final trouble is this, his failure to know and to trust God and to glory in him
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.060]   alone.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.980]   But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.100]   the Lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:05.740]   For in these things I delight, saith the Lord.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:15.780]   Oh I say here is man's real trouble, that he doesn't know God, that he doesn't rely
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.220]   on God.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:23.540]   My dear friend, this is the whole cause of the tragedy of human history.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.040]   It started like this, didn't it?
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.060]   You see the world was not always like this.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:35.220]   The world was once perfect, and man was perfect.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:40.100]   And he was living a life of bliss and of joy and of peace and of happiness.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.380]   Well, what's gone wrong?
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.100]   This is what's gone wrong.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.460]   That man ceased to glory in God and began to glory in himself.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.500]   He began to glory in his own wisdom.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.100]   You shouldn't remain like this, said the tempter to Eve, and she believed him.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.700]   You ought to trust yourself, he said.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.060]   You ought to rise up and assert your own wisdom and your own knowledge.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.540]   You shouldn't say that you have no right to eat any one particular fruit.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.180]   You have a right to everything.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.060]   Trust yourself, express yourself, be yourself.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.220]   And they did it.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:20.660]   Instead of glorying in God and relying upon him, they began there to rely upon themselves
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.020]   and to glory in themselves.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.940]   And down they went, and the world has been down ever since.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.380]   And the world is as it is tonight because of this.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.940]   But God in his infinite mercy still calls us to listen.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:37.260]   Thus placed as we are at this moment, thus saith the Lord.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.620]   He hasn't given us up.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.180]   He hasn't turned his back upon us.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.500]   He's still pleading with us.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.700]   Listen, he says, listen.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.620]   Don't trust in your wisdom.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.060]   Don't trust in your might.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.520]   Don't trust in your riches.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.380]   If you want to trust, if you want to glory, if you want to boast, glory in this.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.380]   Well what is it?
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.820]   Well, the first thing is that he understandeth me.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.420]   If you want something to glory in, says the Lord God himself, it is this.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.740]   Glory in the fact that you understand me.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   Well what does that mean?
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.660]   Well, that I am the Lord.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.440]   What is the thing to glory in?
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:26.040]   That over and above our troubled, tragic world tonight is the one who originally made it.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.840]   We are not left to ourselves.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.360]   God is over all.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.920]   I am the Lord.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.440]   From eternity to eternity, all-powerful, the everlasting God.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:46.240]   The God who made everything, the universe, man himself, and he's above, he's over all.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.880]   He's not involved in these tensions and strivings and strains.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.920]   He's above it all.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.520]   He dwelleth in a light that is unapproachable in eternity, in that high and lofty place.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.080]   He's there.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.680]   Get to know this as God, so that when you've looked around you and seen no hope and feel
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.360]   yourself failing and everything going against you, lift up your eyes unto the hills, lift
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:14.520]   beyond them, look at the creator of the hills, God, away above the flux of time and history,
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.360]   eternal in the heavens, the everlasting creator.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.800]   This is the thing to glory in.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.000]   But wait.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:31.560]   That I am the Lord which exercise judgment and righteousness in the earth.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   What does he mean?
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.040]   He means this.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.600]   He exercises judgment and righteousness in the earth.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.320]   He's still doing it.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.800]   He's a righteous and a holy God.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.160]   He has given his laws for men and for life, and we are meant to obey them.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.760]   And he's concerned that we should.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.440]   He interferes in life.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.320]   That's the whole record of this history, maintaining this righteousness.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.240]   Yes, but he's a God of judgment.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.080]   He not only has told us what we are to do, he expects us to do it.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.320]   He holds us responsible if we haven't done it.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.920]   He is the judge, a righteous, a just judge.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.720]   He demands righteousness.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.800]   Now this is the thing the world needs to know tonight.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.720]   Over and above the bombs and what they may do is the certain fact of death, bombs or
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   not, and beyond death, God and judgment and justice and righteousness.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.840]   We've all got to stand before him.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   We've no right to live as we like and as we please and as we choose.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.080]   It is wrong to say every man for himself.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.120]   Let a man express himself and do what he likes.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.280]   No, no.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.300]   God is there and we're all under him, and we'll all stand in his presence and be judged
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.080]   in the light of his holy law.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:58.760]   I am the Lord that exercise righteousness and judgment in the earth.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.840]   Get to know this.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.640]   If only the whole world knew this tonight, everything would be changed.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.840]   If only all these earthly powers and individuals realized that they're responsible to God and
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.720]   that they've all got to die, your Kennedys and Khrushchev's and all their peoples and
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:19.600]   all their armies, they've all got to die and answer God if they only realized it, how differently
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.940]   they'd behave.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.560]   And so would we all in our individual capacities.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.160]   You wouldn't go on condemning and hating that person if you knew we were to stand before
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   God.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.920]   You wouldn't judge another if you knew that you were to be judged.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.880]   You wouldn't do that unrighteous thing and think you're clever because nobody's seen
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   you.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   God's seen you.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.800]   Everything is naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.840]   Understand this, he says, and then you'll have a new view of life.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.880]   Not only that, and thank God for this other word.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.920]   Let him glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth that I am the Lord which exercise
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.160]   judgment and righteousness in the earth.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.280]   Yes.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.640]   And loving kindness also.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.160]   Loving kindness.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.200]   I wouldn't have preached to this point if I didn't know that I was coming to the word
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   loving kindness.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.680]   All I've said has been negative.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.160]   It's all condemnation.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.160]   I wouldn't have started if I didn't know that this glorious word was coming.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   Loving kindness.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.920]   Get to know this, says God, in your trouble, in your agony, in your pain.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:31.600]   Get to know that I am the Lord who exercise loving kindness in the earth.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   What does he mean?
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   It means this, my dear friend.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.560]   It's all here in symbolic manner on this table before me.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.960]   The loving kindness of God.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:51.360]   Not only justice and righteousness and truth, but loving kindness.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:59.000]   Oh, he has the only hope for us at this moment.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.160]   That whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:19.360]   That though we all deserve the punishment of hell and deserve it richly, that God has
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:25.720]   made a way to forgive us and to restore us.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.800]   It's because of his loving kindness.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.520]   It's nothing in us.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.680]   We've defied him, we've rebelled against him, we've criticized him, we've deliberately
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:40.720]   gone our own way, we've brought ourselves into trouble and our whole world with us,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.600]   and we deserve nothing.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.400]   But he offers to forgive us freely.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:55.960]   His loving kindness was so great that he sent his only son from heaven into this world,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.080]   not only to live and to teach and to give an example, but especially to die on the death
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   of the cross.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.840]   And what was he doing there?
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.320]   Taking the burden of your sins and mine upon himself.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   Taking our guilt upon himself, bearing its punishment, its shame, its suffering, its
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:22.680]   agony, dying that we might be forgiven, that we might live, that we might become the children
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   of God.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.160]   God's loving kindness, God's sole love, that's it.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   It's the only hope.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.560]   This is the thing to glory in.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.160]   My wisdom can't save me.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.560]   I'm involved in the world.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   Death is coming.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   I know not when.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   I can do nothing.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   My wisdom doesn't save me.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   My might doesn't save me.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   My money doesn't save me.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   I can do nothing.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.960]   I'm guilty before God.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   What can I do?
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.280]   This is the thing to glory in.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:53.800]   In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o'er the wrecks of time.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:01.200]   All the light of sacred story gathers round its heads of lime.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:06.640]   God forbid that I should glory, says Paul, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.360]   by which the world has been crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.440]   The loving kindness of God, you needn't be lost.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.880]   You needn't go to that condemnation, that perishing.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.280]   It's offered you as a free gift.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.800]   You only believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and that he died for you and your sins and
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.760]   you're freely forgiven.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.200]   My dear friend, this is the thing to glory in.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.800]   Well now, he says you must understand these things.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.840]   This is the thing to glory in, that you understand all that.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.000]   That you see your position.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.900]   You see what's coming, but you see what God's done.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.360]   But you not only understand it, he says you must know it.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:51.320]   Let him, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.800]   Now this word knoweth is very important.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.320]   The word to know is used in the Bible invariably in this sense.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.680]   It's a very strong word.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.760]   It doesn't just mean knowing about.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.360]   It means knowing in a very personal and in a very intimate manner.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.680]   God says to the children of Israel through Amos, "You only have I known of all the nations
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   of the earth."
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.720]   That doesn't mean that he didn't know about the others.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.480]   No, no, what it means is this, you are the only nation I've been interested in.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.400]   You are the only ones I've known intimately.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.720]   You have been my special people.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   Knoweth.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.880]   Now then, says the prophet, here it is.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.420]   You must not only understand these things.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.960]   You must know them.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.080]   And oh, what a difference there is here.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.960]   There's a difference here, you know, between eternal death and eternal life.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.120]   You say, "Yes, I've listened to you.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.340]   I understand what you're saying, but my friend, I want you to go further.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.800]   Do you know these things?
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.560]   Do you know what it is to experience them?
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.760]   I say you can be freely forgiven if you believe.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.000]   Do you know that you are forgiven?
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.120]   I say if you believe you'll receive a new life and a new nature, you become a child
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   of God.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.160]   Do you know that you are a child of God?
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:12.000]   I say that you must understand that God is the Lord and that he's the judge and that
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.320]   nevertheless he has loving kindness.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.600]   Do you know him?
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.080]   Do you really know these things?
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.060]   You see, a mere intellectual apprehension isn't enough.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.060]   You must know it.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.280]   You must know it intimately.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   You must know it personally.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.760]   You must know it directly.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.080]   This must become living and vital to you.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.920]   It must become real to you.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.040]   You must not only understand, you must know.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.960]   Do you know these things?
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:43.840]   Well, says the prophet, if you understand and know these things, you are entitled to
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.840]   glory.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   Glory in this.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   Why?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:52.040]   Well, because if you glory in this, you'll have had everything else that you need.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.200]   If you begin to glory in God, in Christ, as he has revealed himself in Christ and him
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.760]   crucified, do you know what happens to you?
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:06.800]   You'll have a wisdom greater than that of the whole world put together.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.680]   We, says the apostle Paul to the Corinthians, have the mind of Christ.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.360]   Christ is made unto us wisdom.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.760]   The moment you believe this gospel and really get it and understand it, you'll understand
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.920]   yourself, you'll understand life, you'll understand why the world is as it is in a
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.360]   way you've never done before.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.240]   You know, the Christian is not a bit surprised that the world is as it is.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.720]   He expects it to be.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.680]   He knows that the more men rely on themselves and turn their backs on God, the worse the
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   world is going to get.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.080]   So it has got worse.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.400]   We have prophesied it would.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.520]   And it will get worse until men turn back.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.280]   We understand it.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.320]   Yes, but not only that, you see, we can see through it.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.760]   This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.280]   We can see beyond it all.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.000]   We can see the purpose of it all for the soul.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.440]   We can see the glory that is coming when Christ returns.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   This is wisdom.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.040]   Do you know it's a great thing to be a Christian in a world like this at this moment?
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.200]   The Christian really has an understanding of it all.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.720]   He sees right through it, and he's the only one who does.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   He gets the very wisdom that he desired, the true wisdom, not his own wisdom, and he gets
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:21.600]   power, power to live, power to live triumphantly, power to conquer his old enemies, temptation,
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.440]   sin and evil, power to face all eventualities.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:34.400]   He is not afraid because he knows that he is being kept by the power of God.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.080]   He knows that he is safe in the hands of God.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.920]   He may have to suffer a lot in this world in a physical sense and in other respects,
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.960]   but he knows that his soul is in safekeeping.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.120]   He knows that all is well with his soul.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.320]   He's got this power round and about him.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.360]   The angel of the Lord, as I was quoting this morning, "encampeth round about them that
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.680]   fear him."
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.560]   He knows that he's surrounded, that nothing shall finally harm him.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   The power of God unto salvation is in charge of him.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:09.320]   And then think of the riches that he immediately possesses.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.040]   He gets untold wealth and riches in this world.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:19.160]   I don't know of anything that makes a man so rich as to understand something of the
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.880]   teaching of this book.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.080]   I'd sell everything I've got many times over in order to understand this, because
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   here is everything that I need.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.080]   Riches!
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.960]   Well, let me quote those wonderful words that we were singing just now.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.640]   "No good in creatures can be found but may be found in thee.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.280]   I must have all things and abound, while God is God to me.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.040]   He that has made my heaven secure will here all good provide.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:52.160]   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.080]   What can I want beside?"
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.000]   He's the heir of the universe, and as a child of God, I'm a joint heir with him.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.960]   "Of his fullness of all we received," says John, "and grace for grace."
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:13.880]   Here you can draw out of the rivers of his grace and feel your needs all being satisfied.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.600]   Listen to the Son of God speaking.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:21.520]   "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.680]   where thieves cannot break through and steal.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.320]   Bank in the bank of heaven and your treasure is secure.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.800]   Lay up for yourselves treasures there.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.520]   No bombs can touch them.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.040]   No inferno can make any difference to them.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.440]   Why, my friend," listen again to Paul writing to the Corinthians, "what do you want," he
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.800]   says, "are you out for riches?
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:49.440]   All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.680]   things present or things to come.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:58.960]   All are yours and ye are Christ's and Christ is God's.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.560]   Are you out for riches?
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.600]   Well listen to the Son of God again.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.120]   "Blessed are the meek."
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   Why?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:13.880]   "Well, for they shall inherit the earth, the whole universe."
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.840]   Your little bank balance is a flea bite, it's nothing.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.880]   "Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.440]   If you believe this message you become a child of God and if children then heirs, heirs of
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:35.040]   God and joint heirs with Christ who is the heir of all things, the whole universe.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.000]   All things are yours.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.720]   This is the thing to glory in.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.640]   Get the wisdom you long for.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:50.360]   You're given the might and the power and the strength that you covet and you become the
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:58.760]   heir of riches that can be measured only in terms of the illimitable wealth and power
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.600]   and character of God himself.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.920]   And yes, you glory in this for this reason, that you've not only got it now but you'll
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.800]   always have it.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.760]   Let them send off all their bombs in all countries at the same time.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.720]   Let the universe be blown to nothing.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.400]   It won't have the slightest effect upon this.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.640]   This is the thing to glory in.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.680]   Not in that earthly human wisdom that fails when you need it most of all.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.160]   Not in that might and strength which are waning and disappearing and finally are defeated
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.760]   by the scythe of death.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   Not in riches which moth and rust can destroy and the thieves can take from you, finally
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.800]   again the hand of death.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:57:00.640]   Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.400]   the Lord, the Lord of the universe.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   If you're in his hands, come what may, you're everlastingly and eternally safe.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:19.920]   You can face life, you can face death, you can face all things quietly, calmly, triumphantly
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   and confidently.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:31.800]   You say, "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.240]   Amen.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
