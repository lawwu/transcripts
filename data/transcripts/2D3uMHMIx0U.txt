[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What are the data on how females signal,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   let's just say, testosterone, estrogen,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.680]   and other relevant hormones, and for males as well,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.860]   what are the external signals or behavioral signals?
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.760]   - Yeah, so that's a really important point that you made
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   because they both, those things go together.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.300]   So it's been most controversial for females,
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.960]   but in my view, the data is pretty clear,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.020]   and it aligns, I think, with our own intuitions
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.440]   just from daily life, which is,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   well, some things are apparently not consciously perceptible.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.600]   It's hard to report, but through studies
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.520]   where you just ask males for like,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.180]   okay, how attractive is this woman, or et cetera,
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.040]   that there are changes in the face, for example,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.960]   and that's been one argument is that,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.520]   this is gonna sound funny, but that the signals
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.600]   that in non-human primates are in the rear are,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080]   because we're walking upright, you can't see that really,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.300]   so now it's kind of in the face,
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.960]   and so these changes that happen,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.120]   that the ovulatory cycle is reflected in the turgidity,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.760]   how tight the skin is in the face,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   because it gets a little plumper and a little bit redder,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.520]   and we may not be consciously aware of that,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.160]   but that it's there, right, and it shows up
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.200]   in sort of preference data when you ask
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   heterosexual males, how attractive is this woman, et cetera,
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.040]   so that seems to be the case.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   And also behavioral, so sort of flirtatious behavior--
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.240]   - Increases around the time of ovulation.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there is a classic study
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   that exotic dancers, strippers,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.520]   would actually get bigger tips, more tips,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.840]   when they were ovulating than when they're not ovulating.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   - Interesting.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.640]   - So there may be--
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   - And it could be by virtue of their behavior,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.720]   but it could be the way they dance, proximity to the,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.440]   what I guess the observers, clients,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   whatever you call them.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.360]   - I don't recall that being quantified,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   but it suggests that there's a latent signal there.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   And that men are unconsciously processing this.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.360]   They're not saying, "Oh, her cheeks are particularly
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.920]   "plump and red right now."
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.740]   But that if you measure their ratings
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.880]   or scores of attractiveness, when she's ovulating,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.080]   it's these features that might be drawing out that response.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.520]   - Correct, we can take this back to the monkey porn studies,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   which was our first real foray into trying to quantify
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.960]   the value of various kinds of social information
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.160]   for guiding decisions.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.080]   And we already came into this with a sense that like,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.760]   yeah, things like status, physical prowess, mating status,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640]   are you, you look like a good mate, bad mate,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.600]   are you in mating condition, et cetera.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.880]   And so when you think about that,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.440]   how do you ask a monkey that question?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.080]   You could ask them, they're not gonna tell you
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.000]   'cause they can't talk, but you have to develop
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   a behavioral way to elicit that.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.520]   And so what we did, I think it was pretty clever,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   was to riff on the studies that I had already done
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.780]   looking at varying the expected value of two options.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.200]   So this was the work I did as a postdoc with Paul Glimcher,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   where we revealed economic signals in the brain,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.160]   in the parietal cortex, an area between
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.640]   where visual signals come in and where you make a choice
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   to make a behavioral response.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.560]   And we varied, like in this case,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.440]   monkeys don't work for money, though they work for juice.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.160]   Okay, it's been actually, it's really fun.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   You spend a lot of time figuring out what juice
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.120]   they really love best.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540]   And then economically, you would vary the size
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.420]   of the juice reward that each of the two offered,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.780]   or its probability while maintaining size constant,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.940]   that when you combine those, you multiply those together,
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.180]   you get expected value.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.260]   That's the first model of economic decision-making
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.420]   that was really ever developed, right?
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.140]   You compute the expected value, different options,
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.340]   you choose the one that has the highest value.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.700]   It doesn't work all the time, but it's sort of a rough proxy
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   and we showed that, yeah, neurons in the parietal cortex
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.520]   signal that.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.360]   Monkeys are good economists.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.460]   They choose the one that has a higher expected value.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.860]   Okay, so now take that experiment.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.100]   I'm gonna have monkeys choosing between two options
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.580]   that vary in how much juice they pay out.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.540]   But I'm also gonna pop up a picture
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.300]   when they choose one of them, okay?
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.060]   And they don't know what picture's coming up,
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.700]   but the picture's gonna be, it could be a nothing burger,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.420]   just like some gray square, it doesn't mean anything.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.420]   Or it could be the perineum of a female,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.620]   if it were males that we were studying.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.000]   We did this with males, sorry,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.160]   females making choices eventually as well.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   Could be face of a dominant male,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.400]   face of a subordinate male, face of female, et cetera.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.860]   - What's the equivalent of the swollen taint
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.360]   of a female monkey for, if you reverse the experiment
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.240]   and it's the female monkey who's making a choice
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.520]   about male monkeys, what do they find really attractive
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.360]   in a male monkey?
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.160]   - Yeah, so it's the taint of the male monkey
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.560]   'cause it's providing a signal about how much-
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   - Monkeys looking at taints about monkeys.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.980]   - Yeah, how much testosterone is circular,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.780]   that they've got on board basically,
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.100]   which is a good predictor of their status.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.340]   It's a good predictor of their fighting ability,
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.180]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.300]   And if you're a female,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.620]   that's a reasonable kind of choice to make
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.980]   'cause if you have male offspring
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.860]   and females are predisposed to choose that,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.940]   then your male offspring are gonna do pretty well.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.160]   So that's what we did.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.020]   And we varied how much juice.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.940]   So sometimes monkeys would get paid,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.340]   they'd have to give up juice to see the pictures.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.980]   Sometimes they get paid more to see the pictures.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.400]   And what we did then is we construct a choice curve
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.260]   and we use the differential.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.020]   If it's not 50/50, if it slides one way or the other,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.180]   it tells us that monkeys are paying X amount
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.260]   to see certain kinds of pictures
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.940]   or you have to overpay them, right?
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.060]   And so what did we find?
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.900]   It was really, I think, scientifically revealing,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.820]   but it's pretty fun.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.380]   People got it immediately.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.180]   They will pay--
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.020]   - Juice.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.840]   - Juice.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.680]   They will give up juice.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.940]   They will pay it to see pictures of the perineum,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.180]   the hind quarters of females.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.240]   This was original study was in male monkeys.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.700]   They will pay to see the faces of dominant males.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.180]   And you had to pay them to see the faces
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.980]   of subordinate males.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.140]   Okay, so females will give up juice
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.140]   to see the taints of testosterone rich male monkeys
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   and male monkeys will pay juice to see the swollen taints
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.260]   of female monkeys that are, because of the swelling,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.500]   indicates a better reproductive competence.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.820]   - Yes, better, you know, douse the time.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.740]   The time is ripe, okay, to mate.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.220]   But it's just in general, it's a signal that is like,
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.620]   what we would say is it's important.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.780]   It has value.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.620]   - Monkey porn.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.060]   - It's something you should track.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.660]   And in fact, yeah, they're paying for it.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.620]   So, you know, it just blew up on the internet.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.580]   Even back then, it was like suddenly million,
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.740]   every website was like, oh, you've proven monkey porn,
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.580]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.860]   It was kind of a fun ride.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.780]   It was a New York Times idea of the year in 2005,
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.900]   which was, again, kind of shocking.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.580]   You know, there's like, a little word on that.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.340]   But people, it makes sense.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.340]   And the thing I want to point out is that
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.820]   we ran this same experiment in people,
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.260]   not with unclothed humans.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.060]   So we used, and we used only, well, no, it was,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.980]   and we had to create our own stimulus set
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.340]   because all the stimulus sets that were out there
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.500]   for visual studies of humans were like a bunch of,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.460]   you know, German people looking very dour.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.580]   They were very well controlled.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.820]   And we wanted something that was more natural.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.700]   So we downloaded thousands of photos
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   from this website, hotornot.com.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.100]   I don't know if you recall that,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.020]   but it was a website where you could upload pictures
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.020]   and people would rate you.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.940]   I mean, now that's like-
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.860]   - Probably wouldn't be allowed now.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.780]   I remember Rate My Pet.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.340]   - Rate My Pet, Rate My Professor,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.540]   I think, which is still around.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.860]   - And we were saying rate.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.700]   - Rate.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.940]   - Rate. - Rate.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.980]   - With a T, my pet.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.820]   - Yeah.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.180]   - But this was hotornot.com.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.540]   So you get all these really natural looking.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.380]   And then we had, this was really funny though too.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.180]   So we had a group of,
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.120]   separate groups of raters
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.740]   from the people who we actually tested in the experiment.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.420]   So we had, you know, a group of males,
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.140]   heterosexual males rating the female photos and vice versa.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.340]   And that was interesting in its own right.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.620]   So we were just trying to establish like,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.780]   we're not saying why they're attracted or anything like that,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.300]   just like, let's measure it, okay.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.100]   And it was really fun because, you know,
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.700]   by the, and it took, it was hard work.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.620]   You're having to do one every three seconds.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.940]   And it took like an hour.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.340]   And the, you know, when the women were done rating,
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.880]   they're like, whew, okay, I'm glad that's over.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.440]   The hour's over and our male raters were like,
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.680]   did you have any more?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.120]   You know, can I, I'd be happy to sit here
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.480]   and rate more photographs for you.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.400]   - Interesting.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.180]   So women got sort of like,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.560]   they got tired of rating males for attractiveness.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.400]   - Yes.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.360]   - Males did not tire of rating females for attractiveness.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.960]   - They did not at all, which is, that's anecdotal,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.200]   but it's still, I think it's revealing.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.960]   Then we ran the pay-per-view experiment,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.800]   just like in monkeys, on humans.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.640]   - Pay-per-view.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.960]   - And we also ran a couple of other economic lead,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.520]   you know, standard economic tasks.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.480]   One would be, how long are you willing to wait?
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.080]   So that's a delay discounting.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.000]   Like, in general, you will wait longer for a bigger reward.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.040]   A smaller reward.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   And also how hard would you work?
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.960]   And we, the work was like,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.080]   you had to alternate pressing two keys on a keyboard.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.400]   It was really just menial, laborious, you know, et cetera.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.140]   So, the two interesting,
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.840]   just sociologically it's interesting,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   what comes out of this.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.880]   Our female subjects basically wouldn't give up money.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.000]   They were working for money.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.260]   They were hearing the sound of coins
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.360]   coming out of a slot machine,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.760]   which was proportional to how much money they actually got.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.600]   - Real money.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.420]   - Real money.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.440]   If you ignored the pictures,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.560]   you'd go home with like $17 extra,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.920]   compared to if you were influenced by them.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.280]   And the females did really well economically.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.520]   So they pretty much kind of ignored the pictures
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.760]   of the males, even though they were rated,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.200]   even the ones that were super hot,
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.700]   they were not very concerned with that.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.520]   For the males, it was exact opposite.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440]   So the males are giving up essentially.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.100]   They're paying, and they had thousands of trials.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.800]   They're paying somewhere between a half
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   and three quarters of a cent to see images
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.680]   of women who were rated in the top,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.360]   like third of attractiveness.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.200]   They also would wait significantly longer
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.480]   and they would work really hard.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.600]   It was like rats pressing for cocaine,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.560]   quite literally to keep those pictures up on the screen.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.640]   Okay, so that's the setting we've established in monkeys
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.240]   and in people, similar economic principles
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.820]   that are guiding social, you'd call it attention,
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.440]   social valuation, whatever.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.880]   So we're like, okay, let's go look in the brain.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.560]   So we did an MRI experiment, fMRI experiment,
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.000]   measured blood flow to different parts of the brain.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   We only tested males because they were the ones
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.560]   who displayed differential preferences there.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.360]   And what we found is that kind of parts
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.920]   of the visual system that are involved in encoding faces,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.240]   but then the reward system was activated
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.040]   and tracked linearly how much money
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.280]   these guys were paying to see images.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.320]   There's basically the trade-off value, the currency,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.440]   the translation of pictures into money, okay?
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.180]   Then in monkeys, we studied all the same areas,
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.580]   but now we could record from individual neurons
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.320]   in those areas, rather than looking at blood flow,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.520]   which is a crude proxy.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.360]   And we found exactly the same thing,
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.520]   which is that neurons in the reward system
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.880]   were spontaneously and strongly activated by those pictures,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.680]   you know, that made sense, right?
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.200]   So the pictures of the perinea of females
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.500]   by dominant male faces.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.400]   And that correspondence, I thought, was pretty compelling.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.880]   (upbeat music)
