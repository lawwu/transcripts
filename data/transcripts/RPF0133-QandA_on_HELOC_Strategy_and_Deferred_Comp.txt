[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.440]   with Melissa's question on how to pay off a primary mortgage with a HELOC. Good
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.520]   morning, my name is Joshua Sheets. This is the Radical Personal Finance podcast for
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.000]   today, Tuesday, January 13, 2015. We're gonna get started and just see how far
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.480]   we can go with the time allotted. So let's kick it off with Melissa's
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.400]   question. Melissa, you're up. Hi Joshua, it's Melissa from Pennsylvania and I
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.040]   have a question for you. I keep a money journal where I just jot down ideas and
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.640]   books and different things as I come across them and I was reading through a
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   page that I had jotted down a note from a year or two ago about paying your
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.360]   house off with a HELOC loan. Essentially it was, from what I understand, it was you
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.560]   deposit, you create a HELOC, you deposit your checks into it and pay all your
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.440]   bills out of the HELOC, almost using it as a savings account and in turn paying
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.680]   off more of your principal and decreasing the length of your loan.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   Basically I come to you for advice on if that is a legitimate idea and also if
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   you have any knowledge of that. Also in the page I jotted down it must be
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.360]   associated with a book called Master Your Debt and a website TruthinEquity.com.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.400]   Any advice you have would be great. Thanks a lot.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   Melissa, it's a great question and by the way I point out and commend to you
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.640]   Melissa's strategy of keeping a money notebook. That might be a useful strategy
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.920]   for some of some other listeners to adopt. It's a good way to keep organized
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.680]   and to have ideas and to organize your thoughts. I personally don't keep a
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.760]   separate money notebook but I do keep a comprehensive journal that basically has
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   every idea or every thought that I want to remember in the future and I try to
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.560]   write down resources and things like that. It's a combination of a paper
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.000]   notebook and an Evernote journal. I do have some financial tags in Evernote as
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.360]   well so I commend that to you. It's a simple solution. So Melissa, it's an
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.040]   interesting question to me and this is the type of question that I love getting
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960]   on the show. I had a guess as to what I thought this would be but I
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.120]   wasn't sure. I had never heard of Master Your Debt as a book. I wasn't aware of it
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.320]   so I went ahead and after you called the question on the voicemail line I went
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   ahead and bought the book in order to read and see what it says and it
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.680]   sounded like an interesting book so I just got it off of Amazon. The used books
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.120]   paid a buck or two for it, I can't remember, and was able to get to this
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.880]   chapter and I do have a little bit of a history with this idea. Let me give that
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.320]   history of the idea first and then I'll get to the actual idea and we'll talk
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.120]   about it and see if this is a reasonable idea for us to consider implementing. I
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.240]   remember this years ago when it was probably five or six years ago, maybe more,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.360]   when it was popularized with something that I think was called You First
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.560]   Financial and I think they go by United First Financial now and it was I would
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.720]   say semi popular at the time to promote this idea to take and take out a home
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.840]   equity line of credit on your house and then essentially you put all of your
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.960]   income into that home equity line of credit and you pay your bills out of it
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   and hopefully by putting in more income than expenses out of it then you could
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.840]   actually get ahead and pay off your mortgage more quickly. I spent a long
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.240]   time actually sitting in the office of a representative of that company, at least
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   about two to three hours, trying to understand how this product that he was
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.640]   selling worked and essentially primarily what it seemed to be was a software
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.920]   package to help you track your income and expenses and help you track all of
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.880]   these details and it seemed from what I could figure out that the primary
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.640]   motivation there was the fees for the software package. As I remember it was a
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.400]   few thousand bucks, something like $3,500, but I couldn't quite ever get my hands
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.880]   on how it worked so I was interested in researching this a little bit further. So
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.520]   I got the book and this is what I love doing the show that I can have a little
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.320]   bit more time to research these things that I've wanted to research but haven't
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.560]   been able to do and I'm gonna explain to you how the book presents it and some of
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.000]   the details on it and then talk about whether or not this is a useful strategy
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.200]   in my opinion. I've never done it, I've never known anybody that's done it, I
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.560]   have checked out the website, the website is TruthinEquity.com, I looked
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   through everything I could find there without signing up for a consultation
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   myself so I haven't gone through the process of actually trying to test it
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.280]   but I looked through all the information to do my best to present an important
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   valuable insight into it. So in this book, Master Your Debt by Jordan
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.320]   Goodman, it's chapter 6 and it's entitled Mortgage Free in 5 to 7 Years and I'm
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   gonna read just a few paragraphs from it and let's start with the beginning of
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.640]   the chapter. He says, "This whole chapter is a big secret but it's one you're going
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.440]   to be very happy I am sharing with you. It's a secret that will more than pay
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   for this book. You could use my secret to become completely debt-free in less than
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   a decade. I'm talking about a new way to manage your mortgage and your monthly
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.920]   cash flow so that you and not some banker get to squeeze the most out of
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.360]   every dollar that comes in and every dollar that goes out. Used correctly, this
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.920]   strategy will enable you to pay off your mortgage in as many years as some people
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.000]   take to pay off their cars. The strategy is called equity acceleration or
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.960]   mortgage acceleration. It's not such a big secret in Australia and the United
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.320]   Kingdom where as many as one in four homeowners are accelerating their
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.320]   mortgages. It's legal. It's not a scam. It's entirely above board. Anyone with a
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.120]   decent credit score and good bill management skills can accelerate the end
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.160]   of their mortgage and other debts by using the system I am going to lay out
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.040]   here. Here's a basic outline of how it works. You finance a new home or
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.400]   refinance an existing one by obtaining a home equity line of credit, HELOC,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.520]   requiring an interest-only monthly payment for at least 10 years. You use
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.000]   the HELOC to pay off your existing mortgage, if you have one. The HELOC
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   replaces a new or existing conventional mortgage. You send your whole paycheck
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.320]   into the HELOC every time you are paid. This covers your monthly minimum payment
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.140]   and then some. The HELOC becomes the new depository for your income. You pay your
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.240]   bills out of the HELOC as close to the due date as possible. That maximizes the
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.800]   amount of time your money sits in the HELOC, cutting your interest. Any extra
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.120]   money you have left in the HELOC account after you pay your bills and make the
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.840]   minimum interest payments on the HELOC goes toward further accelerating your
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.120]   debt reduction every month. The key to grasping the power of equity
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.680]   acceleration to eradicate your debt so quickly is understanding how interest is
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.560]   calculated in a traditional mortgage and in a HELOC. As you learned in the
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.480]   preceding chapter, a HELOC is a revolving loan that gives you the flexibility to
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.960]   make interest-only monthly payments every month or to make larger payments
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   if you want to. In a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.400]   principal and interest payment is predetermined and calculated according
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.320]   to a conventional amortization schedule and the principal is assessed every
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.520]   month on an ascending scale. And he goes on and gives some more details. In a HELOC,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.840]   interest is recalculated every month on the basis of the average daily balance
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.360]   of the principal owed. The more money you run through your line of credit, even if
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   the deposits do not stay there long, the more you are driving down the principal
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.680]   and setting the stage for those interest costs to be calculated on a lower
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.480]   average daily balance. As the monthly interest is pushed down, more and more of
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.280]   your cash goes toward paying off the principal owed and that results in lower
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.680]   and lower interest charges every month. That gets compounding working for you
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.960]   instead of against you. So that's his introduction to the strategy. He goes on
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.760]   and gives a couple of examples and he uses an example in the chapter for Mark
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.320]   and Susan. They own a home in Indiana, 12 years left on a 15-year mortgage with a
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.560]   fixed rate of 5.25%. They owe $192,000 left and then they goes
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.800]   through and says their monthly take-home income was about $7,500 and their
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.840]   monthly expenses came in at $5,250. Here's the key. The couple was a good
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.640]   candidate for an equity accelerator because they had a substantial positive
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.140]   cash flow. They also had equity in their home, good credit scores, and more
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.000]   important, a willingness to take an active role in managing and controlling
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.160]   their financial future. Goes on and creates some charts and shows that they
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.120]   would actually, by following the proposed plan of mortgage acceleration, they would
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.240]   be paying off their debt in under five years. So instead of 12 years remaining
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.280]   on their 15-year mortgage, they would be out of debt in less than five years. And
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.520]   then gives another example of Megan and Jared, and I'll skip some of those
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.280]   details. Now, at the end of the chapter, the author sets up some information and
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.080]   he talks about who it's a good fit for. Here are a couple of important things
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   that you need to know. Do you understand the concept? What the accelerator system
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.440]   does is funnel more of your money into debt reduction and set the stage for you
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.520]   to begin to benefit from this immediately. By converting your lazy
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.880]   money, that's money sitting in accounts without connection to your home equity,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.360]   such as a checking account, into money that works to pay off your mortgage, you
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.920]   reduce the amount you owe. That cuts your interest costs and hastens the day when
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.100]   your mortgage is but a distant memory. It's not for everyone. The mortgage
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.160]   acceleration concept won't work for everyone. Like the other strategies in
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.320]   this book, it requires discipline. You have to be a smart cash flow manager to
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.720]   make it work. You also have to have high enough credit scores to get a good
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.960]   HELOC and confidence that your income stream will continue. Implementing this
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.000]   strategy will improve your cash flow from day one, but it may not be enough to
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   mitigate the effects of a variable rate loan. This is why I recommend a thorough
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.080]   analysis of your personal finances by a qualified expert before blindly
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.360]   implementing this strategy. If you decide to implement the equity accelerator
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.920]   concept with one of my recommended suppliers, you may be charged for the
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.120]   cost of the software, closing costs associated with the new loan, or a
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.480]   consultation fee. You won't be able to do this without any costs, but done right,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.440]   the system will be profitable. The risks of mortgage acceleration are these. If
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.880]   you fall back into conventional practice, relying on your checking account for
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.640]   deposits and bill paying, you defeat the purpose of the strategy and could extend
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.600]   the life of your debt instead of paying it off quickly. If you aren't disciplined
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.200]   about paying your bills on time out of your HELOC, you could end up with late
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.240]   fees. If you lose your job and the extra cash flow that makes the mortgage
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.320]   acceleration system work, notice that, and the extra cash flow that makes the
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.640]   mortgage acceleration system work, that leaves you dependent on that open-ended
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.560]   variable rate environment. If interest rates then rise, you could end up going
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.920]   backwards. However, if there is a disruption in income, you can rely on the
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.160]   available equity in the HELOC to sustain your lifestyle until income is restored.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.040]   In this scenario, the acceleration process will be interrupted, but you
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.240]   won't find yourself in a stressful situation wondering how to make ends
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.000]   meet. Goes on and talks about how to do it right. He says to do it right, you have
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.120]   to get the right kind of loan, you have to set up easy transfers, you have to
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.560]   make sure you're using the HELOC as the primary depository for your income, and
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.600]   that you can do it yourself if you're driven and disciplined, but you need-- it's
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   probably better to connect one of the companies. And he gives four suggested
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.880]   companies for how to do it. Number one is TruthinEquity.com, which is mentioned a
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.920]   couple times in the chapter, and then I went back and checked the front cover.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.480]   TruthinEquity.com was founded by a man named-- evidently named Bill
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.040]   Westrom, and I looked at the front cover of the book and it says "Jordan E. Goodman
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.840]   with Bill Westrom," so he's a contributing author on the book, and
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.400]   that's his favorite. Then number two is the MoneyMerge account with United
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.720]   First Financial. That was the one that was quite popular in years past. No More
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.240]   Mortgage, which is another opportunity, and then Harge Gill's Speed Equity, which
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.400]   evidently started in Australia and grew from there. And then at the end, notice
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.600]   here, he says at the end of the chapter, "Once you've gotten the mortgage
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.920]   acceleration plan down, there's a lot you can do with it. As long as your line of
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.520]   credit is sufficiently large, you can consolidate all of your other debts into
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.600]   it and get completely debt-free faster than you thought possible. You can pay
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.920]   off your home in five to seven years, and then with this new heightened level of
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.960]   financial expertise, you can use your HELOC to buy a second vacation or
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.360]   retirement home. Don't look now, but real estate prices are pretty attractive. You
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.880]   can also self-finance your next car, self-finance your next tuition bill, or
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.760]   start that side business without having to fill out a million forms and beg some
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.800]   banker. You can be your own banker now. I told you it would be a good secret." So I
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.920]   hope you're sold based upon reading the narrative in the book. It all sounds very
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   compelling. After all, if we could just understand a slight difference of how a
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   conventional mortgage amortization schedule works as compared to a home
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.840]   equity line of credit, interest payment, and amortization schedule, then just take
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.160]   advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, we can get rich, right? I'm not convinced.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.120]   And I'll tell you why. And this is one of the reasons why I am in such
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:19.000]   favor of enhancing financial literacy. So much as I did several years ago when I
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.440]   was speaking with the Money Merge account, United First financial
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.360]   representative, I spent hours trying to understand the concept and went away
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   thinking I was just dumb and that I didn't understand it, but it was the
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.400]   greatest thing ever. And in this one, I spent, you know, I read the whole chapter
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.680]   and I thought, "Wait a second. Is there something I don't know? Is there something
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.400]   I don't recognize?" Because yes, I understand how amortization schedules
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.720]   work, but the key is you got to go and look at the charts. And this to me is the
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.320]   big difference. For both of the case studies, there is a before and after
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.120]   chart illustrated which illustrates the amortization schedule. And I like to look
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.600]   at numbers because if I can understand what's going on with the numbers, I can
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.640]   be more compelled by the evidence. Before I jump into the details of the numbers, I
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.520]   hope you understand the strategy. Essentially, the strategy is you swap out
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.080]   the normal conventional mortgage for a home equity line of credit. And then
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.240]   every month, you're paying it down by the amount of your net paycheck. And then
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.520]   you're increasing the amount of the mortgage by the amount of your bills
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.160]   which you're simply paying out of the home equity line of credit, hopefully
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.880]   with an account that might have something like check writing privileges to pay
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.000]   your bills with. So assume for a moment that you owe $200,000 on your house and
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.320]   it's valued at $300,000. You apply for a home equity line of credit for $200,000
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   to wipe out your existing mortgage. They go ahead and approve you for that.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.000]   You pay off with the new bank. You pay off the existing mortgage with the
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.120]   $200,000. Then in that first month, let's assume that your monthly income is $10,000
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.840]   and your monthly expenses are $7,000. So you apply the $10,000 that you
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.520]   receive on the first of that month toward the home equity line of credit.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.760]   That reduces your balance from $200,000 down to $190,000.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.920]   Then throughout the course of the month, you pay your expenses little by little.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.760]   And at the end of the month, because your expenses are $7,500, you have increased
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.360]   the balance of the home equity line of credit up to $197,500.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.800]   Then you do it again in the second month. You apply the $10,000 of
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:35.280]   income. You drop it down. So your balance drops from $197,500 to $187,500.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.020]   You increase that by $7,500 and you wind up with $195,000.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:47.360]   So now at the end of the second month, you're at $195,000. That's effectively how it works.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:57.180]   What I was interested in is, is there actually a way to get an arbitrage by getting a home
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:04.160]   equity line of credit where the interest calculation is primarily based upon what the current balance
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.280]   is as compared to the early years of a conventionally amortizing loan where you're paying a lot
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.240]   of interest up front and little interest down the road?
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.720]   And the answer is, I don't think so. So if you look at these scenarios, the first scenario
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:24.760]   that's given in the book, the debtor owes had an original loan balance of $225,000.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.460]   And in their third year of their amortization schedule, they owe $192,934. Well, they propose
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.960]   changing that out with a new loan. But there are a couple of bits of details that you need
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:42.420]   to look hard at. First is what is the interest rate? And in this scenario, the interest rate
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:50.500]   on the 15-year fixed conventional mortgage is 5.25%. The proposed interest rate on the
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:18:02.740]   home equity line of credit is 4.00%. So 1.25% decrease in interest rates. That will make
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.380]   a substantial difference in the amount of interest that is paid over the course of a
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:13.040]   loan. Now, how frequently is it that you can get a home equity line of credit at a lower
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.940]   interest rate than a conventional mortgage? I simply don't know. I don't know what those
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.740]   current numbers are. I think they change over time. In general, with something like a 15-year
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.820]   mortgage, the interest rates on these, at least in the last few years, have been absurdly
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.460]   low. But what's that difference? I don't know. But I'm willing to give them the interest
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.580]   rate. What I'm not willing to give them is this. They illustrate on the first one what
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.820]   the deposited net income is, $7,500 per month. That's what the couple is earning. And then
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.700]   it illustrates what their expenses are. The monthly living expenses are $3,191, and the
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:58.340]   total monthly expenses are $5,249.72. In the first amortization schedule, it simply illustrated
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:07.500]   that that money is spent on cash flow. In the second amortization schedule, it's clear
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:14.580]   that that money is not spent, but rather that money remains in the debt. And so I ran the
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:22.820]   math on it. I said, "What would happen if I was able to actually do this by hand?" I
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.860]   said, "What if the person was willing to put all of that excess cash flow into their
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:35.140]   conventionally amortizing mortgage?" I calculated the normal monthly payment, which is about
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.820]   $1,800 a month. Then I calculated what the excess cash flow was, the difference between
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.100]   the expenses and their income, which the difference is $7,500 minus $5,250. So that was about
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:52.580]   $2,250. I added those together. It was about $4,050 per month.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:58.620]   Well, if they would just pay a total of $4,050 per month, the normal monthly payment plus
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:05.180]   that additional amount toward their conventionally amortizing loan, right in five years, they
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:11.340]   would be out of debt, even without an interest rate savings going from 5.25 to 4. And then
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:18.140]   on the next page, how long does it take with the mortgage accelerator? Five years. There's
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:24.940]   the magic formula. So on that basis, all we're doing is saying we're willing to put all of
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:33.940]   our excess money. Instead of being in a checking account or in some other alternative investment,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.660]   we're putting every excess dollar that we have against our mortgage. And you'll be debt
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:46.280]   free in five years. My problem with it is that the facts, the numbers, are not illustrated
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.480]   by the narrative. So in the narrative, you think this is something complex. And the way
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.940]   I just said it right there, hopefully it's clear. That's why you're out of debt in five
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.940]   years.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:59.140]   Interestingly, listen to this narrative. And I'm going to actually read this to you because
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:05.860]   I want to use this as an example simply to show how you've got to look at the numbers.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.780]   Let's read about Megan and Jared. Here's another quite different example of how the system
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.740]   can work for a Manhattan couple who don't have the extra cash flow that Mark and Susan
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:22.740]   enjoy. So we just said that Mark and Susan was the numbers I just used. Megan at 35 earns
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.860]   a salary of $75,000 as an editor at a New York publishing house. And her husband earns
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:34.180]   $90,000 as an art director. The balance of Megan's inheritance, $50,000, is in a mutual
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.300]   fund that has been returning an average of 8% a year. Megan and Jared bought a co-op
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:44.020]   in the Upper West Corner of Manhattan nearly five years ago in Hudson Heights, where real
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:50.260]   estate prices aren't nearly as high as further downtown. They put $75,000 down on a co-op
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:59.500]   costing $475,000. Are alarm bells going off in your head yet? One thing I have noticed
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.900]   with financial lies is that they're often embellished with beautiful pictures. It's
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:10.500]   like the example goes, if you have a fixer-upper that's a handyman special, if you talk about
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:16.940]   its quaint and its rustic and its antiquey, those should be code words for old and run
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.780]   down. Why do we need to know that it's a co-op in the Upper West Corner of Manhattan
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.140]   five years ago in Hudson Heights where real estate prices aren't nearly as high as further
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.060]   downtown? Why do we need to know that she's an editor at a New York publishing house and
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.740]   an art director? Let me continue. They have 25 years left on their mortgage, which has
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:41.560]   a fixed interest rate of 6.25%. Their combined take-home pay is $9,000 per month. Their monthly
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:49.940]   mortgage payment is $2,463. When you add in their commuting and parking costs and other
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:56.780]   expenses, there isn't much money left at the end of the month. Now how much money would
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.020]   you say is not much money left at the end of the month? If you have $9,000 in take-home
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:09.580]   pay, a mortgage payment of $2,463, and then commuting and parking costs and other expenses?
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.940]   There isn't much money left at the end of the month. Well, flip to the next page. It
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:21.100]   illustrates that their deposited net income is $9,000, and their total monthly expenses
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:28.600]   are $6,637. I don't know about you, but that's, in my world, that's a pretty healthy amount
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.840]   of money left at the end of the month. That's $2,363 left. That's almost a third of their
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:41.000]   income available. That's not insignificant. Let's continue. During the five years they've
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.340]   owned the apartment, Megan and Jared have sent their mortgage company over $147,000
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:55.640]   in principal and interest payments. Of that, $121,121 was interest, and $26,651 was applied
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:06.040]   toward principal. They still owe over $373,348, or 93% of their original mortgage. If they
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.900]   continue on this path for the next seven years, after 12 years of payments, they will still
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:19.880]   owe $318,903. They would have absorbed an additional $152,000 in interest costs and
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.200]   would still have 216 more payments before they would be mortgage-free. Are you lost
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.400]   in the details yet? This is another thing that you've got to watch out for, and people
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.920]   lose you in the details. All they've done is taken a very simple amortization schedule,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.000]   which if you've ever looked at an amortization schedule, you should understand, and add an
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.440]   entire paragraph of confusing text, which simply means you drop down to, what was it,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   line year 15 or so, year 15 and 22. You drop down to the appropriate line on the amortization
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.720]   schedule and take a sentence to explain what every number means. Be careful when you're
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.880]   reading things like this. Megan and Jared have a couple of options if they are to take
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.480]   advantage of the equity accelerator concept. If they simply refinance their current mortgage
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.740]   into an equity accelerator, and Megan keeps her $50,000 inheritance in a mutual fund,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:15.100]   they could be debt-free in eight and a half years. This would save them over $262,675
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.920]   in additional interest costs, and their mortgage would be paid off. In comparison with their
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:27.480]   current mortgage, Megan and Jared would still owe $303,811 of the original balance and $183,836
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.680]   in additional interest costs at that time. If Megan decides to close out her mutual fund
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   and apply those funds toward an equity accelerator line of credit, Megan and Jared would own
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:45.800]   their home outright in only six years, nine months, and would save an additional $36,679
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:53.860]   in interest charges and be mortgage-free. He goes on, "Got the concept. What the accelerator
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.660]   system does is funnel more of your money, debt reduction, et cetera," which I already
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:04.340]   read for you. Here's why I'm belaboring this point. Was everything that the author wrote
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:12.480]   on those pages technically accurate? It's all technically true. What does it miss? You
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.860]   should immediately ask yourself, "Well, what's the interest rate that Megan and Jared are
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.320]   earning on the mutual fund versus what's the interest rate that they're paying on the debt?"
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:27.300]   In this scenario, the illustration was that they have a mutual fund earning 8%. That was
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:33.920]   what was stated in the facts. They have a current mortgage of 6.25%, and then under
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.040]   this proposed equity acceleration program, they're going to drop that interest rate to
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:44.760]   4%. Then we're going to take a mutual fund, which is earning 8%, and use that to pay off
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.720]   the 4% debt. Then we're going to talk about how little interest we're paying. Yes, but
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:57.880]   how much money would we have had if we just stuck with the original? Here's the thing.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:04.720]   This to me is a perfect example of how you can take a concept that might or might not
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.940]   be valid, which I'm going to cover again in just a moment, and you can completely twist
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.400]   it into making somebody think it's the greatest thing in the world simply because they're
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.480]   too ignorant to ask the right questions. In this example of A versus B, it looks very
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.320]   compelling. After all, in A, they put in there the full 30-year amortization schedule, which
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.880]   by the way is another interesting sleight of hand. They start with the opening balance
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.520]   of $400,000, which illustrates 30 years. Then they show, "Okay, well, we're in year five."
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.600]   But then in the comparison one, they start that at year one, which is actually year five
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.080]   on the original schedule. They do that in both of these. You've got a misrepresentation
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:55.640]   of data. This would be akin to whenever you look at a chart. If instead of illustrating
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:03.020]   the scale of the axis starting at zero and going from zero to 100, the chart maker may
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:12.240]   start at 80. Then by zooming in and not illustrating the full scale of the axis, then the chart
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.840]   maker looks like it's a major problem. But in reality, it's a very minor variation in
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:24.480]   data. It's the same thing here. It's a specious false comparison of data. Now, it might look
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.920]   prettier, fine, but it's making it look like a 30-year loan versus a nine-year, when in
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.160]   reality it's a 25-year versus a nine-year. Just a small thing.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.560]   But then look at the numbers. Again, their existing loan is 6.25%. They're refinancing
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   at 4%. That's a massive savings, a 25% cut in interest costs. Then B, in the first payment,
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:56.240]   they're only making a monthly payment of $2,462 on the loan. In the second payment, remember
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.680]   they have a net income of $9,000 and monthly living expense of 6,600. Let's do the math.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:10.080]   What's the difference between those? 9,000 minus 6,637. We've got 2,363 plus the 2,462
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.760]   they're currently putting. They're putting $4,825 a month toward the balance of the loan
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.880]   now. So how long would it take, if I compare these two things, how long would it actually
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:30.200]   take to pay off the mortgage if we just made those two changes? Let's just ignore the interest
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.600]   rate for a moment. How long would it take if we just put that extra payment toward the
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.840]   original debt, which is what you're doing in essence?
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:44.080]   Well, the math is fairly simple, and this is why I want you to learn to run a financial
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   calculator. Let's clear our register, put in $373,348.97, change the sign, put that
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   in as our present value. That's the present value of the mortgage payment. That's the
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:06.200]   amount that we owe on the debt. Put in 6.25, hit that number, and let's convert that into
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.480]   a monthly amount. So we're going to hit the button to turn it into monthly amount. It's
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:18.400]   50% of monthly interest. And let's put in now that $4,825 as our monthly payment. That's
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:24.040]   what we're going to actually be paying towards the loan. Zero for the future value, and let's
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.840]   calculate the end, the number of periods that would be required. It comes out to 99. Divide
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:38.360]   that by 12. That equals 8.25 years. So in scenario one, if they keep their existing
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.120]   traditionally amortizing payment, but they put the additional amount available in their
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.800]   cash flow toward that payment, their debt would be paid off in 8.25 years. In scenario
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:57.280]   B2, which is the proposed payment, how long does it take for things to get paid off? Somewhere
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:06.880]   between eight and nine years. So question, is it this magic gimmick of the mortgage acceleration
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   program or is it the fact that there's an extra $2,363 on top of the minimum payment
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:22.680]   going toward the debt? That's the key variable. Why did I spend so much time on this? In my
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:28.580]   mind this is a very important example of what happens every day in the financial world.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:39.680]   People create a good narrative and in essence divert your attention from one thing to the
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.920]   other. It's like a magician where if they're going to do something with the left hand,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.100]   they want to make sure you're looking at the right hand. That's how most sleight-of-hand
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:54.520]   tricks work. This is a big deal, because the only way to actually understand if this is
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.280]   a good idea or not is to know to look for the interest rate and what the amount of money
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.560]   going to the payment is. Without those two details you can't make sense of this. With
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.680]   those two details you can immediately see that all we're doing is putting a bunch of
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:16.880]   excess money towards a mortgage payment. This was why, at least in my memory, United First
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:23.600]   Financial was charging $3,500 for this thing, for this software package. It's a bunch of
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.320]   baloney. It's a bunch of nonsense. Now if I'm wrong in my analysis, all I've
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.280]   done is just read this chapter of the book. But if I'm wrong, and any of you listening,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.200]   if Jordan Goodman or Bill Westrom, if you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong and show
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.380]   me where I'm wrong. I'm happy to be wrong. All I did was read one chapter of the book.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.040]   But to me that's about as clear of an open and shut case as I can come up with, of a
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   total waste of time and just technical truths that are represented in such a way that it's
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:33:01.960]   lying. I don't appreciate that. So my hope is to equip you to spy that and not fall prey
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.000]   to it. So what are some of the concepts that you
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.880]   could apply towards this? Well, number one, I think this is something that anybody could
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.040]   do. Now I don't know about the actual products. That's what happened is the mortgage market
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.520]   changed and the products weren't available and the home equity disappeared for people.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.160]   That was why I think the market for that stuff dried up some years ago. So I don't know what's
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   available, what's not. I would have no problem checking with a guy like him to see, "Can
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.940]   I do this? Are there products available?" I wouldn't pay big fees for it, but maybe
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.560]   there's a better mortgage product. But any of you can do this and in essence set up a
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:43.520]   home equity line of credit. That way if you're aggressively paying on your principal mortgage,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.280]   you can have access to the cash if necessary through the home equity line of credit. Because
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:54.120]   that's the problem is once you pay down the debt on a mortgage like that, then you're
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.880]   stuck where all the money's locked up in your house and it's much harder to get it out than
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.120]   it was when it was sitting in your checking account. It would have some advantages to
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.220]   have a more flexible mortgage option where you're just paying interest only.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:15.560]   I actually like the so-called pick-a-payment loans that used to be available. I don't even
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.720]   know if they're still available. But where you could essentially choose how much you
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.960]   paid every month. One would be an amortizing payment, one would be an interest only payment,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.880]   and some of them would actually be a negatively amortizing payment where your balance would
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.920]   actually increase. It wasn't even a full interest payment. I think that'd be useful to have
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:36.760]   as an option on a mortgage simply because it keeps flexibility and would allow you to
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:43.620]   maintain your flexibility. I think flexibility is an underrated benefit in a financial plan.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:48.700]   It's always nice if you can help save you. If you suffer a job loss or if you have an
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.780]   unexpected illness or disability, something like that, I like having flexibility. Now
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:35:01.060]   there's trade-offs with everything. That could be a benefit. But you could set that up yourself.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.580]   If you want to have the money in the home equity, that could be great. You pay it off
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.540]   and then just tap the home equity if you need to with a home equity line of credit.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:14.900]   Years ago, and we'll finish up the discussion on this topic with this, years ago when I
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.980]   had that meeting with the representative of United First Financial, what most impressed
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:26.300]   me about what he said was the software that they had created. I looked at the software.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:34.500]   What was neat about the software is it illustrated how long it would take for somebody to be
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:41.660]   debt-free based upon certain decisions. In essence, there was a meter there and it illustrated,
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:51.220]   "Okay, if you spend this $50 on a haircut or you cut your hair yourself, then you'll
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.020]   save this amount of money and interest and you'll be out of debt this much sooner."
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.500]   It was almost like an immediate feedback loop in the software. I'm not sure it worked quite
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.020]   as well as he was showing me that it worked, but I thought it was a brilliant idea. What
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:10.780]   I compared it to is the idea of having a fork for a dieter. Let's say that you have a fork
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:18.340]   and this fork shows with every bite whether or not you are adding inches to your waistline
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.860]   and pounds to your scale or whether you are taking them away with every bite.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:28.900]   If you're eating a bite of chocolate cake, with each bite it says, "0.13 pounds, 0.13
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:34.420]   pounds." By the time you finish the piece, you know that you've gained 1.2 pounds of
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:40.180]   additional weight. Let's say you're shortening your lifespan and it's calculating that by
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.420]   the end of this piece of chocolate cake, you've shortened your lifespan by 14 minutes based
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.540]   upon the extra weight that you're carrying from it.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:54.740]   If you're plunging your fork into a green leafy salad, then you can see the numbers
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.660]   ticking up and you can see the weight dropping off and your lifespan increasing. I thought,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:03.140]   "How cool would that be to have a magic fork that showed that? Wouldn't that be so helpful?"
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:11.620]   Before I'm about to tuck into a 2,000 calorie milkshake, I would have a bit of a moment
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.740]   of contemplation and ask myself, "Do I really want this?"
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.260]   I would love to see, and it's just an idea for some of you intelligent people out there,
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.060]   maybe you know of a software package that does this well. I've never seen a software
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.920]   package that does this well, but I would love to see somebody create a personal financial
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:33.460]   management system that would bring in this immediate feedback loop and that would illustrate
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.900]   in real time, "Here's how much longer you are toward your financial independence goal.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:44.380]   Here's where you are with regard to your debt payoff. If you choose to avoid dining out
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.780]   instead of eating at home, you'll be out of debt this much sooner.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.140]   Congratulations, by the way, these decisions that you've made this month where it seemed
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:59.380]   like it wasn't a big deal because you only saved $327, but the reality is you're going
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.340]   to be out of debt three months sooner. You're going to have your mortgage paid off three
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.260]   months sooner because that's the equivalent to three months of your principal payments
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.340]   on your mortgage balance, something like that. I don't know how to do that, but I would love
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.960]   to see that. I think it's a product that would help.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.740]   You see this happening in the fitness world with all of the biomarkers, I guess it's biometrics,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.900]   where you count, "Okay, here's how many steps I'm at," and you can see for the day, "I'm
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.500]   at this many steps. I've been starting wearing one of these Fitbit things, and so far today
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:38.300]   I'm at 3,749 steps." Well, I know that's not very much. I think we should build some of
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.940]   these tools with financial management. If you are capable of that, then I commend it
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.620]   to you as an idea. Hope that's helpful.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.580]   Let's jump in and do another question today. I think we've got time. Let's answer Robert's
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:55.900]   question. We're going to shift gears pretty dramatically here about defined benefit plans,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.140]   actually about non-qualified deferred comp plans. Kick it off, Robert.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.300]   Hello, Josh. My name is Robert. I'm a frequent listener to your podcast, and I have a multi-part
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.740]   question. In keeping with the theme of the show, it'll be a little bit on the lengthy
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:16.300]   side. My wife is an executive at a publicly traded utility company. She has the opportunity
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.940]   to participate in a deferred compensation plan that pays her a "guaranteed" rate of
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:28.700]   return, currently in the 5% range, but fluctuates with the prevailing interest rates. This is
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.420]   a Fortune 500 company with a track record of solid financial performance, but I'm a
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   little bit concerned about the safety of such a non-qualified plan, even though we could
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:46.260]   really use the ability to defer income currently. We have been participating for several years.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.580]   I have three sort of related questions, or maybe there's one question and a two-part
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:57.740]   question. How safe are these plans, and do they ever really default? The second question
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:05.140]   is, if they are reasonably safe, how much of our overall net worth of investable assets
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:17.020]   can we contribute? We have also are required or strongly recommended to keep one year's
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.820]   salary in her company's stock, and between the two, currently, between the deferred comp
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:28.860]   plan and the company stock, we have a little bit under 10% of our investable net worth
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:35.120]   tied up in her company in one way or the other. We have no debt and are in the highest income
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.540]   tax bracket and expected to pay less in income tax in retirement. I'm 49 years old and she's
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.340]   50 years old, and we both work full-time. Thank you for considering our question.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.060]   It's a great question, Robert. This is going to be a fun one because we're going to go
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:56.180]   into an area that very few people really talk much about. The percentage of population that
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:01.300]   has access to a plan like you're describing is very small, and so this is not commonly
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.260]   discussed, especially in personal finance. It's a little bit difficult for me to answer
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.060]   without knowing the specifics of the plan, which is the way I like it because I can talk
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.860]   a little bit about the theory and then keep the onus and responsibility back on you to
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:22.640]   go and take the responsibility, as you already are, to make your own decision. I'll talk
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.860]   a little bit about the theory. Your primary question is about safety. How
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   safe is the plan? Then your corollary is how do I fit this into my personal financial plan?
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.660]   Let's deal with safety. It's a tough question to answer because I don't have all the facts,
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.020]   but I'll give you, again, the thought process. This sounds, from the way that you described
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:48.260]   it, like non-qualified deferred comp. This is one of those magic areas that we love to
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.500]   talk about. We financial planners, it makes us feel really cool to talk about, "Oh, we'll
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.940]   set up a non-qualified deferred comp plan," just because, at least for me, it was always
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.220]   kind of like the sexy side of the business that I always wanted to, "Oh, I'd love to
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.260]   do it. Yeah, I specialize in setting up non-qualified deferred compensation plans for owners of
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.580]   highly-compensated." It just sounds cool, or at least it always did to me. Maybe that's
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.060]   a bit juvenile, but I always thought it sounded cool.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:18.740]   In essence, what we're trying to do is we're trying to solve the problem of how do we set
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.740]   money aside without setting it aside for all of our employees. Let me define some terms
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   here because in order to understand this, you need to understand a few terms. Let's
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:34.400]   start with non-qualified. When financial planners or tax wonks use that term, it has a very
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:43.060]   specific meaning. In this context, non-qualified means that this is a plan which is not governed
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:50.180]   by the rules of what we call ERISA. ERISA stands for the Employee Retirement Income
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:56.760]   Security Act. This is a law that was passed in 1974, and it established all kinds of standards
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.940]   and rules for employee benefit programs. We usually just refer to it as ERISA, E-R-I-S-A.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:10.620]   This is actually an extremely complex area of planning. It's very specialized, and it's
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:16.500]   very important for companies to make sure that they are in compliance with ERISA. Depending
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.900]   on the type of plan that you have, the compliance may be simple and straightforward, or it might
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:28.900]   be more challenging and difficult. ERISA can cover essentially any kind of benefit
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:37.580]   plan. It can cover health plans. It can cover retirement schemes such as what we're most
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.340]   used to as 401(k)s, 403(b)s. Those are the ones we're used to. There's all these detailed
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.380]   rules that have to be followed. I'm not an ERISA expert. Technically, I guess I'm supposed
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:52.260]   to be. I did a designation that's called a registered employee benefits consultant.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.460]   So technically, I'm supposed to be. All I know after reading two massive textbooks on
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.340]   it is that I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm going to leave it to the experts that
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:06.180]   practice in it day in and day out. I read the textbooks and passed the exams. It's
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:12.980]   such arcane, difficult information that I only have the basic concepts of it.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.260]   The plans that people are used to participating in, again, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, we call these
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:26.260]   qualified plans. These qualified plans fall under the purview of ERISA rules. The ERISA
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:34.620]   rules ensure that all employees are treated equitably. That's the basic function of ERISA,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:43.540]   is to make sure that you don't have some filthy business owner who is giving special treatment
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:51.320]   with one fancy-dancy benefit to two favorite employees and then just completely destroying
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.060]   the rank-and-file employees that are actually the backbone of his business. That's the whole
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.980]   point of ERISA.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:03.220]   You've got all of these different classifications. You've got the top hat rules. You've got highly
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.760]   compensated employees who are highly compensated employees who are not. You've got all these
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.740]   ratios and things that indicate it. Basically, if your plan falls under ERISA, then it needs
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:22.020]   to treat all of your employees in a like manner. You can't discriminate in favor of your key
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.740]   employees. You can't discriminate in favor of your wife and your wife's brother who work
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:31.100]   at the company and give them a special package that you're not offering to everybody else.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.820]   You have to treat everybody alike. Otherwise, your plan is disqualified. If you're out of
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.580]   ERISA compliance, it's just a world you don't want to be in.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:44.740]   If you just simply choose to avoid ERISA, then you have a little bit more flexibility,
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:52.780]   but you also have some limitations. In order to actually avoid ERISA, then a plan must
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:59.700]   meet these two qualifications. It must be unfunded, and it must be maintained by an
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:05.780]   employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:12.460]   management or highly compensated employees. I'm going to define these terms in just a
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:17.580]   second, but it's important that you recognize that specifically in order to get out of ERISA
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:23.100]   compliance, which is where all of the government rules and regulations are to protect the so-called
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:29.500]   working man, the common worker, there's going to be some additional risk involved.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:34.460]   These plans need to only be available for your highly compensated employees or for a
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.040]   select group of management. That's the key is where you mentioned that your wife is an
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.620]   executive at a publicly traded utility company. That's why she has access to this type of
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.620]   plan.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:51.800]   Now, let me additionally now define the term I said. It must be unfunded. When we use the
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:59.660]   word "unfunded" in employee benefits, it has a very specialized meaning. For tax purposes,
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:05.900]   the distinction between a funded plan and an unfunded plan simply involves the question
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:12.260]   of whether the employee has received property from an employer or simply received the employer's
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:19.940]   promise to pay in the future. For income tax purposes, the treatment of a transfer of property
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:26.720]   is very different from the transfer of a simple promise. If the employer transfers property
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:32.620]   to the employee, then the amount of the tax and the timing of the taxation, that's determined
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:40.740]   under IRS Code Section 83. In essence, Section 83 simply says that if an employer transfers
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:46.820]   property to an employee as compensation for services, then the employee is taxed on the
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:52.140]   fair market value of that property in the first year in which there is no substantial
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.160]   risk of forfeiture. I've mentioned that little lingo on the show previously, the substantial
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.460]   risk of forfeiture. That's the doctrine that actually is applied to see when does this
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.260]   transfer occur.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:13.500]   For income tax, again, when the employer transfers the property to an employee as compensation
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.620]   for services, then you're taxed on the fair market value of that property in the first
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.380]   year in which there is no substantial risk of forfeiture. What would be an example of
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.820]   this? Well, it would be your paycheck or your wife's paycheck in this example. As soon as
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:32.540]   she receives the paycheck, then she's taxed on that in that year because there's no substantial
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.380]   risk of her losing it. There's no substantial risk of forfeiture. She has the paycheck and
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:41.580]   now she's going to be taxed on it, which is the whole goal, what you're trying to do.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:48.380]   You said, "I could really use the ability to defer the tax." Here's the key. To defer
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:55.820]   taxation on property that is transferred as compensation, then the employee must have
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:07.340]   a risk of forfeiture. That's when we're dealing with property.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:13.580]   The flip side is to defer taxation on a simple promise, then we get into a different code
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:20.620]   section, not Section 83. We get into the requirements of Code Section 409A, which is one of the
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.500]   code sections that governs a lot of these plans. Then we've also got to deal with what
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.220]   are called the constructive receipt rules. When does the actual employee actually have
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:35.660]   constructive receipt of the property and dealing with the promise of the property?
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:41.340]   The definition of a funded plan, so we're trying to define unfunded and funded. The
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:46.660]   definition of a funded plan for tax purposes draws that line between what is a promise
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.420]   to pay versus what is actual property that's transferred. If we're dealing with a promise
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.620]   to pay, then we're dealing there under constructive receipt and when does the employee actually
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:01.500]   constructively receive the property. Anything different than that is covered by Section
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.500]   83, which is what we're all used to dealing with.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:12.300]   In a tax sense, a plan is unfunded if there's no fund of any kind set aside. But it's also
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.380]   considered unfunded even if the employer has set aside money or property to the employee's
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:24.580]   account as long as the assets are available to the employer's unsecured creditors. The
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:30.100]   assets can be protected against the employer itself, or they cannot be, but they must be
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:37.060]   available to the employer's unsecured creditors. In essence, the IRS doctrine says that in
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:43.100]   an unfunded plan, the employee's rights to any assets set aside must be no better than
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:49.660]   those of an unsecured creditor of the company. This makes sense. Again, remember what we're
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.660]   trying to do. We're trying to defer taxation. To defer taxation, we have to make sure that
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:51:00.820]   the employee doesn't receive that money. We've got to make sure it's set aside, the employee's
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:05.240]   not receiving it, and there has to be a substantial risk of forfeiture. Property has to be available
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.940]   to the company's creditors. Because this is a fairly flexible arrangement, we've got to
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.860]   make sure that, unlike the qualified plans where it's set aside, we've got to make sure
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:20.820]   that the company's not just going to go ahead and tuck money aside.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:26.700]   Let me compare the two examples. If we're doing an ERISA qualified plan versus a non-qualified
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:31.400]   plan, an unfunded non-qualified plan. In an ERISA plan, let's assume that your wife is
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.340]   at this utility company, and she's participating in her 401(k). When she's tucking that money
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:41.540]   aside into the 401(k), and then all of a sudden her utility company goes bankrupt and the
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.460]   creditors come calling, and they say, "Hey, listen, you've got all this money here in
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:51.260]   the pension accounts, in these 401(k) funds. We want that money to pay our bills." Well,
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:57.260]   the answer in that case is no. That money is separated and is protected in a trust.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.580]   There is actually a trust that's established that holds those 401(k) dollars. So the money
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:09.180]   is protected in the 401(k). But in exchange for that, the rules are very, very specific.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.980]   All the employees have to be covered, and so you can't have key management all of a
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:18.020]   sudden tucking $400,000 into that 401(k). That's why there are the restrictions there,
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.620]   according to the tax doctrine.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:24.300]   Now on the flip side, a non-qualified plan, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.740]   is very flexible. It can be started, it can be stopped all the time. Unlike a 401(k),
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.220]   which you have to go through all these hoops to set up, they can start it, they can stop
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.980]   it, they can set one up for one employee, you can set up others for multiple employees.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.820]   So in this case, in order to avoid the abuse, you can't have this plan protected from the
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:46.060]   claims of creditors, because if the key management knows that the company is going down, all
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.380]   they do is just take all the company assets, funnel them over here into the plan, look,
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:54.860]   hey, it's covered. And they walk away rich, fat, and happy, and the creditors get stiffed.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.260]   So that's the – I know I've used all the technical lingo, but that's the doctrine
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:06.420]   essentially that's actually being followed, is they're trying to protect from the key
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:12.340]   management being able to tuck money aside into these non-qualified accounts and saying,
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:13.860]   well, these are protected from creditors.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:19.820]   So let's get out of the weeds. The biggest danger with non-qualified deferred compensation
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:25.740]   plans is that they're simply not secure for the employee. The money is available as
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.980]   part of the company's general operating fund. Now, it may be accounted for in a separate
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:35.900]   manner. So I assume your wife has a separate account, which is being calculated based upon
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:42.260]   individual performance maybe of some kind of fund. And so it's technically separate.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:47.540]   But the reality is that if you have a couple – $300,000, $400,000 in there, that money
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:54.980]   is not actually hers until she actually receives it. It's still the company's.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:59.500]   And so from an accounting standpoint, they might actually be an accounting ledger that's
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   illustrating a balance of $400,000. But company management could have chosen to employ that
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:10.780]   $400,000 into the purchase of a new power plant or whatever they've decided is a good
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:18.460]   use for the money. So that's the tradeoff. In exchange for not being taxed on the income
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:25.540]   currently, you give up control of the income. And you don't have the ability to get it
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.300]   until the future, and so there's some chance that you're going to lose it. And because
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:34.180]   you have that substantial risk of forfeiture, you're not currently being taxed on it.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:40.660]   That's how it works. As soon as – your wife no longer has that substantial risk of
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:46.060]   forfeiture. As soon as she has the money and it's a sure thing, well, at that time, you'll
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:55.260]   be taxed on it. That's fundamentally how they work with the tax doctrine behind it.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:55:00.840]   And so the answer to your question is how safe is it, that's a hard question to answer
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:07.940]   because the reality is you do have a substantial risk of forfeiture. It is possible that you
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:15.180]   could lose the money, and that's why you're getting the tax deferral. That's how it
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:21.580]   works. In order to get the tax deferral, you have the risk of loss. If you give up the
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.740]   risk of loss, you also give up the tax deferral because now you've received the property
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   and now that property is going to be taxed. So what do you do? How do you look at it?
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:35.500]   Well, this is where it depends on – very much on the company. And the first thing you've
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:44.500]   got to look at is you've got to say how strong is this company? Is this company financially
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:51.560]   strong? Is it financially viable? Is it well run? There are some different ways of actually
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:55.040]   funding these accounts, and I'm going to go through them in just a second, but the
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.380]   key is they don't actually have to be funded. Technically, they are unfunded. There is no
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:06.500]   separate trust that is established and set aside where the money is just protected. These
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:10.540]   assets are part of the general assets of the employer. Now, the employer may choose to
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:15.260]   handle them in a separate way and account for them and set them aside in a separate
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:21.300]   account, and that's probably a good thing, but they don't have to. These are part of
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:26.240]   the general assets of the company. So you very much are dependent on the general – how
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:33.740]   strong is the company? And let me use a layperson's example to make this clear. If I work for
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:39.300]   the big utility here where I live is FPL – no, it's NextEra now, so let's just say it's
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.740]   NextEra. If I work for NextEra, which is a large utility company, and the president of
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:48.100]   NextEra comes to me and says, "Joshua, you're just a marvelous employee. Listen, we're
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:54.500]   going to offer you this special deal. If you fulfill the terms of this employment contract,
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:57:00.880]   we're going to offer you an additional $15,000 of employment – excuse me, $15,000 per year
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.340]   of retirement income every year of retirement." That promise has some weight because NextEra
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.900]   is a large – it's a financially viable company, and the employer is making a promise
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:17.520]   to pay in the future, and that payment might just be made out of the cash flow of the company.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.380]   There might not be any funds set aside, no reserve account, anything like that. And that
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:25.380]   could be completely valid. That could be a completely valid example of a non-qualified
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.600]   deferred compensation plan. I am working now in exchange for compensation, which I've
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:35.820]   deferred for the future, and this is a special plan that's been set up exclusively for
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   me. I don't have any actual transfer of property. I just have a promise to pay in
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:45.680]   the future, and so therefore I'm not taxed. I haven't constructively received any property,
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.980]   so I'm not taxed on the money now. I'll be taxed on the money at 65 when I receive
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:55.220]   that first $15,000 check. But in the meantime, the company could close up and blow away.
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:59.140]   Now, on the flip side, but that promise still has some strength because it's provided
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:04.140]   by NextEra Energy. Now, if Joe's coffee shop next door hires me and they say, "Joshua,
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:08.820]   you're just this genius, and we want to hire you, and we're going to pay you $15,000
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:16.540]   per year from 65 on," that also falls under all of those same arrangements. We set up
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.540]   a simple arrangement. This is a non-qualified deferred compensation program, and there are
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:25.340]   some rules we have to follow, but I'm trying to keep things simple.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.660]   But the value of that promise, in my mind, it's not quite the safe. Joe's coffee shop
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:35.160]   that's just getting started next door is compared to NextEra Energy. Big difference there as
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:43.380]   far as their financial viability. And so the ultimate safety and security of the program
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.900]   is based upon the financial health of the employer.
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:51.020]   Now what about the deferral? What about the fact that you can defer income into it? Doesn't
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:58.060]   matter. That's just a feature of the plan. In the same way that a 401(k) is actually
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:02.460]   a subset, a type of profit-sharing plan. What most people don't understand about the technical
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:09.780]   way that the retirement accounts work is that a 401(k) is actually a profit-sharing plan
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:16.560]   with 401(k) provisions. And those 401(k) provisions actually permit the employee to defer some
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.420]   of their income and have it set aside. But the employer can just maintain a profit-sharing
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:27.960]   plan without 401(k) provisions. But by being able to add that 401(k) option there, it's
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.700]   reduced the cost for the employer, and that's why they're so common nowadays.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.140]   So same thing with non-qualified deferred comp. The plan can actually be just a promise
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:41.660]   to pay like I outlined that will give you this $15,000 if you perform the requirements
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.740]   of this contract, or I can defer, you know, will allow you to defer 10% of your income
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:50.620]   into this separate account. So what about the funding? Well, there are a couple different
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:56.180]   ways that these can be funded. And these are the ones that are most commonly used. First,
[00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:03.100]   there can be just a simple reserve account that is maintained by the actual employer.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:08.380]   And so here there is an actual account that the employer has, and this account can be
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.420]   invested in different types of securities. It could be invested in all types of financial
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:20.780]   securities. There's no trust, so there's no separation here. There's no trust. And the
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:26.180]   funds are actually fully accessible to the employer and to the employer's creditors.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:32.260]   And so this satisfies the requirements of being unfunded for tax and ERISA purposes.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:40.020]   And so this is quite common. There could also be an employer reserve account with employee
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:47.300]   investment discretion over the account. So under this idea, the employer, excuse me,
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.600]   the employee perceives that there's a greater security because they can select the investments
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.900]   that are in the account. They get to direct and say, "I want my money in a stock mutual
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:01.020]   fund," or "I want my money in a bond mutual fund," or "I want my money in a cash, you
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:08.980]   know, CD account." So that needs to be limited under the technical rules to some fairly broad
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:14.160]   investment classes, so equities, bond funds, some mutual funds, because you don't want
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.660]   to have the opportunity to select specific individual investments because that could
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.340]   cross the constructive receipt rules.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:27.540]   So if I had the opportunity that I'm going to have an account with the level of discretion
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:35.100]   where I can short Home Depot stock, well, now that's going to cross over. And yeah,
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.620]   the IRS would say, "Well, hey, guess what? You've got this money set aside, but the reality
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:43.340]   is when you can short Home Depot stock, you've actually pretty much received it. You've constructively
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.460]   received the money, even though it's in a separate account. You control it just as effectively
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.200]   as if it were in your own IRA. So therefore, you have it, and that would violate those
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.680]   rules and we'd lose the tax deferral."
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.000]   So that's another way, though. So the first way, a reserve account that's just simply
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   maintained by the employer, and the employer makes all the choices, or a reserve account
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   maintained by the employer where the employee can direct the investments.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.160]   The funds could be deferred into corporate-owned life insurance, and this is called COLE. This
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.760]   is kind of an interesting area of planning if you are a life insurance agent. We refer
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.720]   to two different types of life insurance planning. One is COLE, corporate-owned life insurance.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.200]   The other is BOLI, bank-owned life insurance. This is an interesting type of planning. It's
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.080]   one of those sexy sides of the business. It's a very different type of life insurance planning
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.680]   than kind of kitchen table, here's how much life insurance mom and dad need to make sure
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.940]   the kids are taken care of if they die.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:46.880]   But under a COLE plan, then we actually put the money into life insurance policies on
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.840]   the employee's life, but the policies are owned by and payable to the employer. These
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.080]   are cash value life insurance policies. They're not term insurance. These are cash value life
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:04.560]   insurance policies, and this can actually be a mechanism for providing financing for
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:12.400]   the employer's obligation under the terms of the plan. By using life insurance financing,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.680]   then the plan can actually provide a death benefit, even in the early years of the plan,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.920]   which can be really useful to younger employees. That can be a real benefit.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   So by participating in this plan, I know that, okay, I've secured a death benefit for my
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.400]   family. This can be a valuable part of my deferred compensation. If I set $10,000 aside
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.580]   just into an investment account, I don't have any death benefit. I got to go buy life insurance.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.120]   But if I have a death benefit and I have an investment account, that can be useful. So
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.660]   these are often funded with corporate-owned life insurance.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:45.000]   There can also be something set up which, if you are a CFP student, you need to understand
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.800]   the term what's known as a rabbi trust. Rabbi, like a Jewish rabbi, this was actually, it's
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.720]   so-called because the case that established this as an operating arrangement dealt with
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:04.760]   a synagogue with a rabbi who wanted to have the money set aside for his retirement. So
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.240]   in essence, a rabbi trust is a trust that's set up to hold property that's used for financing
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.080]   a deferred comp plan. And so the funds are still available to the employer's creditors,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.440]   but they're not available to the management of the company.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.260]   So under this scenario, maybe there's a rabbi trust established. There's a standardized
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:32.740]   document now. The IRS has provided standardized trust terms that will basically protect the
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.380]   account for greater safety to the employee. They'll protect the account from management
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.840]   being able to come in and say, "Look, there's this really great deal on this power plant
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.460]   that's going out of business." I don't even know if this happens in the power business,
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.700]   but follow my metaphor. "There's this great deal on this power plant that's going out
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.000]   of business. We got a steal of a deal. We're going to buy it at 30 cents on the dollar.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.120]   So we're going to take all the money that's in these deferred comp plans, and we're going
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.160]   to use this to come up with a down payment on the power plant." They can do that if
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.680]   there's not a rabbi trust. If there's a rabbi trust, they can't do that. But if they go
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.100]   bankrupt, the creditors can still get the money.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:12.200]   And then finally, there can be some sort of third-party guarantee that's established.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:18.320]   And in this scenario, the employer goes out to a third party and obtains a guarantee to
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.840]   pay the employee if the employer defaults on the obligation. And so that could be a
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.680]   shareholder of the company, a related corporation, or it could just simply be a bank, or they
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.120]   obtain a letter of credit where the bank agrees if the employer breaches its obligation, they'll
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.320]   go ahead and pay the employee out the benefit.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:45.120]   This does raise a little bit of concern that because of the guarantee, then the plan will
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.800]   switch from being unfunded to funded for tax purposes, not for ERISA, but for tax purposes.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:58.160]   But if the employee goes out and gets the third-party guarantee independent of the employer,
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.280]   then it's not formally funded. So again, this is one of those specialized areas, just a
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.040]   little note that you need to be aware of. And obviously, I guess it's more for the general
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.400]   listening audience if anyone's setting one of these up.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.160]   So you need to ask how this account is funded and see if there are reserves that are held
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:19.680]   by the employer. But back to your question on safety, this is what determines how safe
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.340]   it is. I would boil it down. If your company is financially strong, then the account is
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.800]   probably as safe as the finances of the company. So if you think the company is still going
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.240]   to be here, which obviously you do, but if you think the company is still going to be
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.040]   here when your wife retires, then it's probably pretty safe. If the company might not be here
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.400]   when your wife retires, well, it's not super safe.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:47.520]   Now what is of interest to me is what the 5% rate is based on. So I would say pick up
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:54.780]   the phone and ask them. Call Human Resources. It might be connected to some sort of rate
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.200]   simply for the convenience of the employer to track the performance of the account. They
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.400]   might be using some external rate and saying, "We'll give whatever this rate is as a crediting
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.660]   mechanism to the account," when in reality the assets are not set aside, they're not
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:14.440]   invested in anything. Or that rate might be tied to a specific financial product. So if
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.600]   it's funded with a life insurance contract, that might be the rate that the life insurance
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:24.520]   company is paying to the people in the separate accounts. And so they're just passing that
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.980]   through. Theoretically, it could be an annuity contract. It could be a guaranteed investment
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:35.560]   contract, a GIC, a G-I-C, guaranteed investment contract. Those are offered by insurance companies.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.360]   It could be mutual funds, maybe a stock fund, mutual bond fund. It's unlikely to be a stock
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:45.640]   fund with a 5% guarantee. But just ask. You've got to ask.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.520]   And that's the key. When I was with Northwestern Mutual, I had one of these plans, and I could
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.720]   use the deferred comp plan. And any money that I put into the plan would be credited
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.080]   based upon the dividend interest rate that Northwestern Mutual earned off of its general
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:07.800]   portfolio. So an insurance company has a general account, which is their primary investment
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.940]   account, which is the reserve account for their insurance contracts. They need to fund
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:18.160]   all of the insurance contracts that remain outstanding. And whatever that portfolio earned,
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.880]   that was what my account was credited. And so it worked out really well. It was a guaranteed
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.320]   -- it would change, it would fluctuate a little bit year by year, but it was a pretty high
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.200]   rate. And so insurance companies often will offer
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.140]   special types of annuities for these types of plans. I won't get into all the names,
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:40.080]   but there's some unique products, and that may be what this is funded with. Just ask.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.920]   You've got to ask. Hopefully, with a little bit of that background,
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.960]   that'll give you a bit of an idea to ask some questions and not feel bad about asking. But
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.880]   in essence, the safety of the promise is based upon the financial security of the company.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.040]   If your company goes bankrupt, pools in Enron, WorldCom, whatever, all of the assets that
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.480]   are in that deferred comp plan, as long as it's a non-qualified deferred comp plan, and
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.680]   if I've diagnosed what it is accurately based upon your voicemail, all of those assets are
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.080]   available to the general creditors, the unsecured creditors of the company.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.160]   So let's answer part two of your question. You said that you've got right now probably
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.840]   about 10% of your investable net worth is tied up in a company. So the question is,
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:34.800]   is 10% tied up in one company? Is it a lot, or is it a little? I don't know. I don't know.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:41.160]   And this is one of those areas where it's very much a gut call. And I'm going to talk
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.240]   a little bit about this in the question, which now that I've stretched these shows into,
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.200]   instead of answering all these questions in one show, it'll probably be Wednesday or Thursday,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.160]   I'll answer the question from the listener from Bonica in Sri Lanka. Actually, it'll
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.640]   be tomorrow. Probably I'll answer the question from Bonica in Sri Lanka. He's out talking
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.440]   about asset allocation in his context. How do you figure out if 10% is too much or is
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:10.280]   too little? It's going to depend. It's going to be a lot of it depends here. It depends
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:16.600]   on how much money you have. 10% of a million dollars is very different than 10% of $20
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.560]   million as regards your standard of living. You could look at this in two ways. And so
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.240]   I'll paint these two parallels for you. Let's say you have a million dollars of net worth
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.400]   and you lose 10% of it. Well, that's only $100,000. But the reality is, comparative
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   to your lifestyle, the ability for you to have $900,000 versus a million dollars at
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:43.400]   that lower level of assets, that's going to make a dramatic difference in your lifestyle.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.440]   But 10% of $20 million, if you've got $18 million or if you've got $20 million, is that
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.160]   going to dramatically affect your ability to make the BMW payment? Is that dramatically
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.000]   going to affect your ability to go out and buy the next BMW? It's not going to make much
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:07.360]   of a difference. 18 to 20, you're all in the same club. But 900 to a million, that's a
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:12.600]   lower real number. But I guess to my mind, it'd be a higher perceived number as far as
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.040]   lifestyle. You could argue that the other way and say, well, it's not really that much
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.520]   money, but $2 million, that's a lot of money. In my mind, the other thing you have to be
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.840]   aware of is that if it's 10% of your net worth, it's probably also 50%. You didn't say your
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.080]   position, but maybe your wife, if she's an executive, maybe she's a higher earner or
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.560]   substantially higher earner than you are. So if it's 10% of your net worth, but if the
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.440]   company goes bankrupt, it's also 50% of your income or 70% of your income. That's going
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.080]   to be a substantial number. But on the flip side, if you actually look at your financial
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.120]   planning, it sounds like you've got plenty of other assets. You've got no debt. You're
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.160]   asking questions. You're listening to shows like this. I'll bet the rest of your portfolio
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.280]   is abundantly diversified among different companies, different sectors that you've planned
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.240]   things out. So I simply don't know how to answer that question. It's one of those things
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.520]   where I don't have any mental models that would guide me. I would have to look at it
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:16.120]   personally. And if you knew of some information where you were nervous about this company,
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.040]   then I would start trying to diminish it. If you knew of something that you were bullish
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.760]   on this company, if you had other assets where you could suffer a wipeout, maybe it'd be
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.800]   okay for more. It's one of those things where I just don't have any mental models to apply
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:38.640]   to it. If any listeners do, come by and note those for me. This is episode 133, so radicalpersonalfinance.com/133.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:47.240]   And I would love to know any ideas that you have on this subject for Robert. But I don't
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.640]   know. I probably wouldn't want more than 10% tied up there, considering that you have sizable
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.080]   incomes and that it's at least half of your income. If I could conveniently lower it,
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.680]   if you weren't especially bullish on the future of the company, then just keep the one-year
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:09.160]   salary in stock and don't go more heavily in. I'd pay attention to the company and to
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.920]   the industry. What happens to this company if oil prices are dropped? Is this company
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.280]   going to be affected? Affected positively, negatively? Frankly, I've reached the end
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.520]   of what I can do on a show like this, and I refer you from here to your financial advisor.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.280]   Hopefully you feel a little bit more confident with some of the information just by having
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.640]   a little bit of the technical background to understand. And I hope that this was a fun
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.440]   introduction for others of you who aren't familiar with non-qualified deferred comp
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.720]   to kind of have a bit of an intro to it. It's an interesting world of planning. If I were
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.080]   going to go back and do planning, it's definitely one of the areas that I would consider working
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.400]   on. You've got to figure out a different business model because the sales cycle is
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.540]   extremely low, it's extremely complex, and this is one of those things where you need
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:05.080]   a national presence. You're going to be working with companies all over the country, and you've
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.520]   got to be extremely expert from a technical perspective. You need a marketing plan that's
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.560]   going to get you in front of the right people. It's one of those things I could never figure
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.160]   out with my resources how to set up the things I needed on the front end to kind of crack
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:24.320]   that nut. But it's one of those areas where you can do billion-dollar deals in the insurance
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   business and the commission check on billion-dollar deals is a pretty sweet one. It's on my short
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.680]   list, but I can never figure out how to make it work. Maybe some of you can crack that
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.720]   nut. That's it for today's show. I will come back. I've got two questions left. I'll come
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.680]   back tomorrow, and I'm going to respond to a question from Mary on where to incorporate
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.200]   California versus Wyoming and also how to incorporate for a son. Then I'm going to answer
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.680]   that question from Bonica, who's living in Sri Lanka, a listener to the show, and ask
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:00.200]   some questions on asset allocation and diversification from his perspective, living in Sri Lanka
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.840]   and trying to apply some of what I talk about on the show to his scenario. I love scenarios
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.680]   like that because they help me to kind of think through and see the principles that
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.000]   exist in financial planning.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.680]   Hope you enjoyed today's show. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can email me,
