[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The United States fought a number of wars on the periphery, beginning with Korea and
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.120]   then Vietnam and so forth, where we were willing to accept defeat rather than use our nuclear
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.840]   arsenal, always because behind those peripheral countries, if you will, was a major nuclear
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.520]   power, China, Soviet Union, whatever, and we didn't want to risk a nuclear war.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.280]   So at that level, deterrence really seemed to work for a long time.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.320]   But there's been a change lately, and it's kind of terrifying, I find it, at least.
