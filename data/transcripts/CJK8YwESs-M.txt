[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, we all want to be loved by God.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   But why?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.620]   Why do you want to be loved by God?
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.880]   Is it to escape eternal judgment?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.540]   Is it to be freed from the guilt of sin?
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.920]   Is it to have a clean conscience?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.700]   Or is it because the consequences of sin have made a mess of your life?
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.960]   Why do you want to be loved by God?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.520]   This was the topic taken up by John Piper in a sermon nearly 20 years ago.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760]   A clip sent in to us from a listener out there.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.880]   Here's Pastor John preaching in 2001.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   Now a certain man was sick, John 11, 1.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.520]   Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.640]   So this is clearly a picture of sweetness and love.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.600]   Mary loved Jesus and Jesus loved Mary.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.720]   Mark that word "love."
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160]   It will show up several more times.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.300]   It was this woman whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:31.520]   Verse 3, "So the sisters sent word to him, saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom you love is
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   sick.'
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   But when Jesus heard this, He said, 'This sickness is not to end in death, but for the
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:50.280]   glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified in it.'"
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.840]   So now you have two profound realities on the table.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.120]   Love and glory.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.920]   The love of Christ and the glory of Christ.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.760]   And my question is, how do they relate to each other?
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:19.200]   Verse 5, "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.720]   So," verse 6, "so when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two days longer in the place
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.680]   where he was and let him die."
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120]   Notice three things.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   One, Jesus chose to let Lazarus die.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   Two, He was motivated in this by His zeal for the glory of God to be manifest.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.080]   Verse 4, "Third, this motivation is love."
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.040]   Do you see the word "so" or "therefore" at the beginning of verse 6?
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   Do you see what it's preceded by and followed by?
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.800]   It's preceded by, Jesus loved Martha.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.640]   Jesus loved Mary.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   Jesus loved the dying man, Lazarus.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.360]   Therefore He did not go heal him, but stayed two days longer where he was and saw to it
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   that he died.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.120]   Now what on earth could possibly turn that into love?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.160]   Verse 4, "This is not going to end in death.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:00.600]   This is all about the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified in Him."
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   So here's my definition of the love of God based on this text.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:16.880]   God's love is His doing whatever needs to be done at whatever cost so that we will see
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.320]   and be satisfied with the glory of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.840]   Let me say it again.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.600]   The love of God is His doing whatever needs to be done at whatever cost to Himself or
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:46.560]   to us so that we will see and be satisfied by the love of God in Christ forever and ever.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.320]   Let me confirm this with John 17:24.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.680]   Here's Jesus praying for us and He loves us in this prayer.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.280]   Oh how He loves us in this prayer.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:10.440]   John 17, 24, "Father, I desire that they also whom You have given Me may be with Me where
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:19.880]   I am so that they may see My glory."
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.600]   If Jesus loves you and prays for you, do you know what?
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:34.320]   He finally asks for you that you may see Him.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.280]   The ultimate answer to the prayer of love is, "Show them My glory, Father.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.080]   Show them My glory."
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.440]   And they will have arrived at ultimate satisfaction.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.120]   So what does love do when we cry out, "Help Me!
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   Love Me!
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.200]   Forgive Me!"
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:10.680]   God says, "I will engage all My might and the life of My Son to give you what you need
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   most.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   Me!
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.800]   A fellowship with Me!
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.840]   A sight of Me!
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.120]   An enjoyment of Me!"
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.960]   I said this in Orlando Friday night to a group called the Ivy Jungle.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.680]   And a man came up to me afterwards and he said, "Now wait a minute."
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.120]   He opened his Bible to John 3, 16.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.560]   He said, "This is the verse I know.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   This is the verse I love.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   How does what you just said fit into this verse?
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:05.120]   For God so loved, loved the world that He gave His only Son that whosoever believes
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.600]   in Him would not perish but have eternal life."
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   And I said, "It fits like this.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.360]   John 17, 3.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:34.640]   This is eternal life that they know You, Father, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.440]   Why do you want to be loved by God?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.320]   Yes, not to perish.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.200]   Yes, not to go to hell.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.800]   Yes, not to have a guilty conscience anymore.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.400]   Yes, to have the marriage put back together.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   But if that's all you want, you don't know Him.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.880]   You don't know Him.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   It's for life.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   And what is life?
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.600]   It is to know Him and His Son.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   It's to fellowship with Him.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.480]   It's to behold Him.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.440]   It's to be satisfied with Him.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   It's to enjoy Him until Christ becomes our treasure.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.280]   We don't know what it is to be loved by God.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   Powerful.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.400]   Yeah, that is why we want to be loved by God, to get Him, to enjoy Him, to be satisfied
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   in Him.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.080]   It reminds me of Pastor John's excellent book, God is the Gospel.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.720]   If you have not checked out that book, God is the Gospel, do so.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   It's great.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's available right now.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   The free PDF is at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   You can get it right now.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.040]   This sermon clip today was sent from John Piper's sermon on 2 Corinthians 12 titled
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.400]   Thankful for the Love of God.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.040]   Preached on November 18th, 2001.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.440]   Stacy, a man in Charleston, North Carolina, sent it to us with this testimony.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.520]   "I was a homesick freshman in college when I first heard this," he said.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.080]   "It impacted me because it was the first time that I understood that the love of God for
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:05.640]   us is not primarily meant to save me from hell, but to bring me home to God.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.520]   This was revolutionary for me, and now I see this more and more as I grow closer with God,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   and still in the midst of some homesickness six years later.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.720]   But His keeping me from my earthly home has allowed me to know His love like I never even
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   knew it before."
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   That's so good.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.680]   Thank you for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.760]   All of our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons have comforted you, and we share that clip with
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   the APJ audience.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.080]   If you have one, email me.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.280]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of when the clip happens in
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.760]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.440]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.200]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.680]   Well should a Christian juror be quick to acquit in the courtroom?
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.040]   We're of course going to talk about pacifism, particularly of a Christian's responsibility
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.640]   on juror duty.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.200]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.600]   We will be rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday for that.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.080]   We'll see you then.
