[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   I love seeking out new travel experiences and places to go, and if you do as well, then you will love this conversation.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.960]   Hello, I'm Chris Hutchins, and this is All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.080]   Today, I'm talking to the world's most traveled man, Harry Mitsidis, who is one of only three people to have visited every country in the world twice.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.580]   If you enjoy this video, give us a thumbs up, subscribe or leave a comment below.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.840]   Harry, thank you for being here.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.460]   Thank you for having me.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.240]   I guess I want to go back to the beginning and understand how did your, I don't know if obsession is the right word, but love of travel begin?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.780]   Well, it's a sweet obsession, but I guess it starts with the fact that I have parents from different countries.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.360]   So my father's Greek, my mother's English.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.900]   I grew up in Greece speaking English.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.240]   So I think when you're exposed to that from a very young age, you realize that there's a big world out there.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.320]   And I've always been a bit of a geography geek.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.660]   I loved looking at maps and I loved looking or studying aviation timetables.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.500]   And I never really thought I would go to all these places.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.900]   But gradually I thought, OK, let me try to do the whole of, say, Europe.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:33.060]   And when I had done the whole of Europe, which is quite contained and has about 45 countries and it's relatively doable without a very high budget, then I'm like, well, there's more than just Europe.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760]   Let's try going here and there.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.280]   And then before I knew it, I had 150 countries visited.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.200]   And then I suppose it was, why don't we do them all?
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   And that's it.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.880]   And then once you get into it, you can't stop.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.940]   I think that's a common thing that people are excited about, wanting to see more countries.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.040]   I know I've kind of tracked my list, but not everyone has the time.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.560]   How have you managed to find all of the time?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.240]   And maybe there's some misconceptions here, but the cost to be able to do all of this travel?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.600]   Yeah, yeah, well, indeed, time and cost are probably the two main parameters here.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.080]   The third one is the will.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.880]   Now, many people have the will, but they don't have the time or the funds.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.960]   Well, in terms of time, I worked for a long time in education as a lecturer in colleges.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.280]   I used to teach management, leadership, things like that.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.440]   But the good thing of that is that you get a nice chunk of holidays, at least in Europe,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   you do.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.400]   So I used to have about a month around Christmas and then a couple of weeks or more around
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.200]   Easter, and then two and a half months in the summer.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.660]   So that took care of the time.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.920]   And of course, I would optimize my travels in order to try to kind of put different destinations
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.200]   together and get as much as possible out of the trip cost wise.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.720]   Well, I mean, when I did this, when I was younger, I would really be quite budget conscious.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.440]   I would get the cheapest flights, stay at the cheapest places.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.800]   I took advantage of things like couch surfing when they were very young and people had barely
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.960]   heard of that.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.360]   So I mean, that was one way of keeping the budget relatively normal.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   But I'm not going to lie.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.920]   I mean, some destinations are, by definition, expensive.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.000]   You know, you can't go to Nauru without spending quite a lot of money on the flight, let alone
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.360]   the visa and the hotel, because there's basically only one.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.680]   So it's going to be expensive.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.840]   So, yeah, I mean, the cost is something that I was always aware of.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.200]   And I tried my best to optimize things and maybe sacrifice other things.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.880]   As you were kind of going through this adventure, I think you kind of hit the world or at least
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.760]   all the countries by 36.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.360]   Were there ones that were particularly challenging to check off at the end?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   There were.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   I think I always say I've been particularly lucky in the sense that I sort of navigated
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.360]   through wars and global crises and stuff and managed to get the difficult countries in
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   when they were not too dangerous and not impossible to do.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.680]   I didn't have particularly hard time getting visas either.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   But at the end with Equatorial Guinea, which was my last one at the time, there were 192
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   countries.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.120]   So you've reached 191.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   There's one left and there's no way to do it.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.640]   I was I was totally desperate.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.560]   But when I when I reached that point, there's this adage, if you have a problem, tell everyone
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.160]   about it, every single person.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.280]   And so what I did is I would wake up and I would live and breathe Equatorial Guinea.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.640]   I would write to random people I hadn't heard of for a long time and just say, you don't
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.000]   by any chance have any connection to Equatorial Guinea, do you?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.320]   And anyway, at the end, this strategy worked.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.840]   A friend of a friend of my mother's had business dealings with Equatorial Guinea.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.360]   And I got the visa thanks to this stranger who was happy to help me.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.960]   And that's how I completed the last country, which was by far the hardest.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.200]   For people who don't know, which includes me, what, you know, Equatorial Guinea, not
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.760]   a country I've heard a lot of people talk about.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.600]   So is there a reason why Equatorial Guinea is so difficult?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.880]   Well, it's no longer that difficult now.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.800]   It's still relatively difficult.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.280]   And yes, well, what happens with Equatorial Guinea, it's been ruled by the same man for
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.000]   I think it's almost 50 years now.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.480]   And at one point there was this coup attempt.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.680]   And since then, they became very picky about who they'd allow into the country.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.200]   So it's been a notoriously difficult visa, even though the country's tiny.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   But yeah, it's one of the hard ones for everyone in the travel community.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   North Korea, for the record, I know it's impossible now to go to for Americans.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.080]   But for everyone else, it's not that hard.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.680]   You just pay and you go.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.160]   I mean, unless you're a journalist or have, you know, extensive social media against North
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.480]   Korea, they'll be happy to have you.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.240]   You're probably getting a curated trip of only what they want to see and not much latitude
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.360]   to do what you want.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.120]   But I do know a few people have been on tours of North Korea.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.480]   Well, that's the only way to do it.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   And even I mean, you can have your own tour.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.680]   In theory, it'll be a bit expensive.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.920]   But if you want to, you can go on your own.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.320]   But you're still going to have two minders.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.280]   And yes, obviously, they're going to take you where they want.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.360]   So it's not going to be a trip where you can go for leisurely walks in the evening or something.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.040]   You will be stopped.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.800]   Yeah, and one of the things you said earlier that made me want to share, you know, you
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   mentioned that, you know, you travel doesn't have to be expensive, especially when you
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   were younger.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.120]   You know, we traveled for seven months for about seven thousand dollars back a few years
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   out of college.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.880]   And so I think the another important point is the slower you travel, sometimes the less
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.160]   it costs.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.360]   And so I know you're a fan of slower travel, really getting into a place which actually
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.440]   led you to kind of within Nomad Mania, create a list of countries that that was not just
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.180]   countries, but regions kind of helping people realize that because you got out of the airport
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.120]   in Frankfurt, maybe you haven't actually seen Germany.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.160]   And you know, if you as listening to this as an American think, wow, if someone wants
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.200]   to check America off the list, well, they could just go to New York and they've seen
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   America.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.800]   And actually, it's a lot more than that.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.040]   So you talk a little bit about the process you got to actually create a different list
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.320]   of places to visit than what is kind of more standard, just a list of countries.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.620]   Well, you know, counting countries is now a thing.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.000]   And there's a lot of travelers out there who are aiming to visit every country.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.040]   But in my perspective, this is really not enough, because indeed, if you just land somewhere
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.300]   and see the capital, say, have you really experienced the country?
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.560]   When I tell people I live in England, they're like, oh, London, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   And I'm like, wait a minute.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.360]   I don't live in London.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.800]   Somehow, people, the minute you say England, they immediately think you live next to the
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.160]   Big Ben or something.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   So I think that's a very good starting point.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.120]   There's a lot more to countries, whether they're big or they're small, but especially the big
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.080]   ones than the capital or the major cities, say.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   So in Nomadmania, the initial idea was to divide the world in a rational way where you
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.920]   get the most out of a country and you can really judge who has seen stuff rather than
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.360]   who has just ticked places off or countries off.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:07.160]   And that's why we've got a list of 1,301 regions and compare that to 193 countries.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.200]   So it's about six times or seven times the number of actual countries, because we believe
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.880]   in dividing the world in that way.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:22.040]   And in terms of slow travel, we recently launched a list of slow travel where we look at how
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.920]   long someone has spent in a place.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.520]   And that way, they kind of get rewarded for being slow and indeed slow.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.760]   First of all, by being a slow traveler, you understand the country so much better.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.880]   Your chances of meeting locals or even learning a little bit of the language increase.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.820]   So I think when I was younger, I was in a hurry.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:53.640]   But one of the joys of getting older is learning to take life a little bit slower.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   And now I think I'm embracing this idea of traveling slower, not because of the cost
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   so much, but more because of the joys of it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.920]   In preparation of this, I thought, oh, I'll go through and check off my travels.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.340]   I know of the essential regions, I feel like I've done well, but of the broad regions,
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.760]   I think I'm way far behind.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.360]   And in a way, I appreciated the fact that it created a number almost so big that it's
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.480]   more about inspiring me to try new places than to try and complete the world, if you
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.600]   will, which actually I liked.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.040]   It looks like I'm at 169 and a lot more to go.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.480]   So that was a bit of a humbling experience in a good way and kind of reminded me that
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.800]   there are certain countries where maybe I haven't actually seen a lot of the country,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.120]   even though I've been to the country a few times, because you could spend a week somewhere
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.240]   and you still don't hit it.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.000]   So it just kind of even just filling out the process kind of inspired me to maybe push
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.400]   the way we travel a little bit.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.540]   I do think that seven days may be enough for a country like Liechtenstein or maybe some
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.560]   of the Caribbean islands.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:11.000]   But I mean, if you look at, say, China or the U.S., I mean, seven days, really, is that
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.280]   is that enough to say you can grasp the U.S.?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.220]   I mean, the U.S. is so different.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.120]   I mean, there is a lot of homogeneity in terms of some things.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.640]   You know, every city has its McDonald's as you drive in and, you know, all those things.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.200]   But but, you know, the regions of the states are so fascinatingly different.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.240]   And I don't think I know them well at all.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.760]   I'm in fact planning on a long trip to the States early next year.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:47.080]   So I think seven days is really not a number where you can be proud of yourself for some
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.040]   countries, especially the bigger ones.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.760]   And it looks like you still have by my count, is it 17 regions left?
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   Yes.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.020]   On the main list, I have 17 left here.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.220]   And is there do you see it as a goal to to check them off, especially because you kind
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.680]   of helped coin them or how how do you view this last 17 and and what's holding you back?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.040]   Well, you know what?
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.800]   I think now that I'm almost at the end, I've kind of run out of steam.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.120]   I'm not really that motivated to reach the end.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   And I think if I do, it'll be like, oh, now what?
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   You know what?
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   What next?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.280]   What what other lists can I concoct?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   I'm happy to have a few that a few of the 17 are really easy.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.040]   I mean, I've got I've got a couple of regions in Peru, which if I wanted to, I could just
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.000]   do do any time.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.760]   It's not that they're particularly challenging.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.400]   Some of the others are really hard, objectively to get to.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.840]   One of them is Gaza, which is now in the news.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.720]   And I'm quite sure nobody's going to be visiting that that area for the foreseeable future.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.560]   So, you know, I don't really see it as a goal in itself.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.480]   I see it more as a as an inspiration and as a number.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.240]   You know, I think the idea here is to try to do the best you can for yourself.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.960]   It's not about competing with other people or other travelers.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.440]   It's making sure that you have those regions out there.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.560]   Each region has its page with what you can see, what you can do, and they can be a way
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.440]   for you to plan travels and to think of, oh, yeah, why don't I go and do this, this and
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.160]   this in Peru, say, rather than just the capital?
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.120]   You know, it gives ideas for more travel.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:42.280]   I think eventually, maybe by the time I'm 70, I will finish the list if I can.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.760]   But that means I still have another 19 years to go.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.300]   It's going to be one region a year, maybe on average.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.040]   And for anyone listening who feels maybe a little overwhelmed, let's talk a little bit
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.880]   about, you know, the benefits of travel you've seen probably through your community, through
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.100]   your own travels, through the people you've met.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.620]   I would I would imagine quite a lot of benefits that people accrue from putting themselves
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.240]   in new experiences and traveling the world.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.160]   How would you kind of describe that benefit?
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.880]   Well, I think the best thing about travel is that you learn very much about yourself.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.640]   First of all, I think there's nothing quite like travel to put you out of your comfort
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.040]   zone in situations where, you know, you wouldn't normally find yourself.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.600]   And then you realize how you react to them, what kind of behaviors you have, which you
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.680]   might have never known because you never needed to deal with certain situations.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.720]   So I think the benefit of travel, first and foremost, is learning who you are, because
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.080]   is where we grow up and if we never really explore further, I think we may never really
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.560]   know who we are.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.840]   Often we may be conditioned by other people or, you know, we may aim to please the community
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   to be, you know, who they expect us to be.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.360]   I think in travel, and especially if you're traveling alone and independently, you learn
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.480]   a lot about yourself.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:18.320]   I think the other thing, the other benefit for me has been an increase in my optimism.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:26.040]   I think by nature, I'm a little bit of a pessimist about the world, but I've had such great experiences
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.960]   when traveling.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:34.480]   And I have almost never had negative ones in terms of locals, you know, mean spirited
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.920]   behavior, theft, are very rarely if ever had problems.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:47.600]   And on the contrary, I've only been exposed to kindness, selflessness, people being very
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.880]   curious about me in a healthy way, helpful people.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:58.200]   So I think this has helped me be more optimistic about the planet and the people on the planet.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.360]   And, you know, I genuinely now believe that human beings are not really that bad after
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.440]   all.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.600]   Even though sometimes when you live in a huge metropolis, you might forget that.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.400]   And then, of course, well, the obvious one is that, you know, you experience so many
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:23.600]   different things, so many changes in scenery and weather that you by nature become adaptable.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.480]   And also you're never really bored because, you know, there's there's never really anything
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.740]   to be bored about with all these constant changes.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.640]   And we were exposed to so much that, you know, we just have this new perspective on the world
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.040]   and it kind of changed them.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   And he said, I'd always been able to feel something about travel, but couldn't articulate
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   it.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.160]   And the thought being experienced by my children, I could really like viscerally see the difference
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.080]   of the way their perspectives opened and, you know, their perspective on the world changed.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.200]   And it was really cool.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.120]   So I am excited.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.720]   I think our kids at one and three are probably a little too young to see that perspective
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.160]   shift.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.400]   But it's still something we strive to do a little bit of now and are excited about doing
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.440]   a lot of in the future.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.660]   Yeah, I'm sure they're going to love it.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.200]   There is there is a downside with that.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.480]   And the downside is exactly that when you come back, you often don't feel you belong
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   anymore.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.440]   You know, you kind of can't really relate because you've you've experienced something
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.840]   so radically different.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:36.160]   I find with many of my friends from Greece where I grew up that, you know, we're still
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.360]   friends because of old times sake, but we don't really have that much in common anymore.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.440]   We just have totally different perspectives on life and on on everything, whatever you
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.480]   do in life, there's always going to be a little bit of a downside.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.280]   So I don't see it as negative, necessarily.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.920]   That's possibly the price you have to pay.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.160]   And you mentioned solo travel.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.480]   Are you're all your travels by yourself.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.160]   Do you take friends, family, partner, anyone like that ever?
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.600]   When I was doing all the countries, I traveled exclusively solo.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.200]   I enjoyed it that way.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.000]   And also I'm an only child.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.320]   So I think we only children, we have a particular way of enjoying our own company.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.520]   It's not something strange for us.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.820]   I think people who have siblings don't always understand this.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:33.880]   So for me, that was fine in sort of the last decade or so, partially because of nomad mania,
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:41.160]   I have branched out into group trips, occasionally organizing trips with other nomad manians,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.480]   especially to really obscure places, or if the trips are really expensive, in order to
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.700]   share the costs.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.500]   So gradually, I've discovered the joys of traveling with other people recently.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.440]   Just about a month ago, I was in Mauritania with a small group of eight people.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.560]   We did the iron ore train, which is kind of a bit of a classic now in the community where
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.720]   you spend the night on top of iron ore, literally.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   And that is a really unique experience of travel because you get onto the train during
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.320]   day, daylight, and it's quite hot because it's the desert.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.280]   But then at night, it becomes really cold.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.600]   And during the 18 hours of the trip, you need to kind of adapt to all these temperature
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   changes and landscape changes.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.280]   And that is best experienced in a group.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.400]   There are trips like that, or North Korea for that matter, where having a group is very
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.880]   grounding because everything around you is so bizarre.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.600]   So at least you can experience it, and then it's a bonding experience for the rest of
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   your lives.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   You're like, oh, we did North Korea together.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.760]   So yeah, yeah, lately, I have done more trips in groups, but I think deep down, I still
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.960]   am a solo traveler.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.680]   And when you say bizarre, for anyone who's unfamiliar, that means?
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.960]   Well, people often ask me which country should they visit, or, you know, which of all the
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.000]   countries should they go to?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   And I always say North Korea, because there's no other country like it.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.080]   It's really like being on another planet.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.000]   Well, first of all, you can't have a mobile phone.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.880]   You're not really connected to the outside world at all.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.440]   So it's like going into this bizarre place, which is not connected with the outside, which
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.760]   is still living in the 1950s.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.320]   And the whole rhetoric is about the 1950s and the Korean War.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.840]   And then you're always surrounded by these minders who take you around.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.080]   And it's just endless propaganda about the 1950s.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   It's just, it's very hard to explain it.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   It's just weird.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.280]   I think you only realize how weird it is when you leave North Korea.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.560]   What happened the first time I went, when we left, and we were on the train coming back
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.200]   into China, and everyone on the group was looking at China, and there were neon lights
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.660]   and, you know, advertisements and ordinary things.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.400]   And we were looking at these as if we had never seen them before.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.400]   We were like, "Oh, neon lights.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   What is this?"
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:28.080]   It takes five days of North Korea to kind of get into this warped sense of reality where
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.520]   everything else, you know, is suddenly not really known to you anymore.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.280]   It's really, really strange.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.080]   So I mean, if anyone can go, they should.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.720]   And I wouldn't say it's dangerous, but it's just out of this world.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.360]   You've talked about a lot of dangerous destinations in other circles.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   You visited a lot of places people call dangerous, Somalia, Libya.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.640]   You know, I'd maybe put Syria on that list, except I've also been there.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.240]   So I at least have my own experiences.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   Think about opening people's minds up to some of those places.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.480]   And what would you tell people that they have to benefit from considering them?
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.920]   And how much danger is there really?
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   Well, first of all, I don't think anyone should force themselves to do something that they
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.480]   feel is uncomfortable.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.160]   You know, if they don't want to do it, they shouldn't be doing it.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.360]   But I think if people do want to do it, but at the same time are thinking of the dangers,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.440]   they should ask people who've been.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.960]   That's probably the best advice, you know, and people who've been recently, because the
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.000]   situations often change there.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.880]   I think they can be the best source of up to date information, what the reality really
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.400]   is on the ground.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:51.880]   I have never really been to a place where I felt I was in danger, like at a particular
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   time.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.580]   But I think in many, in many cases, the danger is not, it's just to be at the wrong place
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.040]   at the wrong time.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.200]   And to be very honest, I'm going to be doing this trip to the States, and I'm beginning
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   to be scared of going to Walmart, you know, to a random Walmart somewhere, I'm like, well,
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.800]   is that dangerous?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   And I'm dead serious, you know, I think that may be just as dangerous, if not more dangerous
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.160]   than going to Mogadishu in a very different way.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.560]   But you know, if you're at the wrong place at the wrong time, then, you know, danger
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.800]   can stalk.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:32.500]   I don't think most of the world is dangerous unless it is an active war zone, of course,
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:39.260]   in which case you just don't go, I would never go to a place where there are hostilities.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:45.400]   Having said that, I was in Ukraine just a few weeks ago, but not at the front, obviously,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.960]   I was in parts of the countries which are quote, unquote, safe.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   Okay.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.940]   And, you know, you've alluded to the fact that you haven't seen many real world kind
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.540]   of dangerous situations, but I'll push you only because the first email we had mentioned
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.640]   that there might be some, you know, what would you classify as kind of a dangerous situation
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.000]   you have been in?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.680]   Well, I was once arrested in Yemen, and the people doing the arresting were the police,
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.720]   the sort of good guys.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:22.680]   So I guess that that meant that I was quote, unquote, safe, maybe, but that situation was
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.320]   dangerous in the sense that you never really know what their intentions are.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   You know, do they want a bribe or do they want to really mess you up?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.280]   And you never really know the context, because I don't speak Arabic, of course.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:44.960]   So that was, I would say, a dangerous situation where with possibly different handling or
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.360]   had it been different people, I could have got into a lot of trouble.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.440]   I don't think I would have died.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.840]   But you know, I could have ended up with a serious jail term or anything, really, they
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.520]   could have planted drugs into my bag if they wanted to, and then accused me of something.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.640]   You never really know.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:12.280]   But again, my faith in people overall being okay, was proved even in that situation.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.820]   And what advice would you give to someone in those situations?
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.920]   Like what were you telling yourself in that moment?
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.520]   Well, I was trying to be calm.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.420]   I think in general, if you're faced with a dangerous situation, losing it is not going
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.920]   to help you.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.200]   You know, you've got to try to be as calm and contained as possible.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.000]   I think the best thing is to take it very matter of fact, like, okay, this is happening
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.100]   now.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.480]   Let me see how I can deal with it in as rational a way as possible.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.920]   Now, of course, if the situation is rapidly unfolding, like you're in the middle of a
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.000]   gunfire or something, there may not be much time to process that rationally.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.800]   But I do think that panicking is definitely a no no.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.560]   And I also think that becoming aggressive is also a really bad idea.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:12.160]   It's best to be as humble as possible, as likable as possible, given the situation,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.280]   and then try to think rationally of the options you've got.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.400]   Of course, every situation is different.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.080]   So you know, there isn't really a blueprint how to deal with danger.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:32.440]   But yeah, I think one of the things one learns from traveling is also being generally calmer,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.760]   you know, because if you're traveling a lot, and you're always overexcited about every
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.120]   little thing that goes wrong, then you're probably not going to live very long.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:47.800]   So I think, you know, being calm, and in general, taking things in your stride is something
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.840]   that you learn as a traveler.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.080]   And that is something that can then serve you when you are in a difficult situation.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.400]   And are you do you do anything to prepare for these?
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.760]   So let's say you were planning on going to Ukraine, which you said you recently did or,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.160]   or I know you've been to, you know, all the places, but let's Afghanistan, Somalia.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.100]   Are you planning things in advance, whether it's hiring a local fixer or someone to help
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   you out?
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.600]   Or how do you think about planning those things?
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.120]   So they do go smoothly?
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.520]   Okay, well, when I go on a trip, in general, I don't plan too much.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.380]   And I don't really read a lot.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:30.600]   But this is in general, and then there's what I call the the crisis, or the dangerous zones.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.480]   And for those I do have my own exceptional measures.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.920]   So I will read more, I will definitely try to get up to date relevant information.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.600]   So that I know if it's really wise or not to go there.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.900]   Sometimes that's not always easy to get.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:53.640]   But you know, I'll double check information, there's usually other people who've been and
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.260]   thanks to Nomad Mania, we know these people.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.820]   So this is something that helps me as well.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:05.060]   And then yes, in certain countries, I would not travel without a fixer, even though I
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.820]   know people who do.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:12.460]   But for example, in Afghanistan, when I went the first time I really did go entirely alone,
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:19.260]   I just landed in Kabul in 2003, got out of the airport, and just looked around and thought,
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:26.900]   well, now what, but I was 30 and and probably, you know, a little bit more of a daredevil
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   back then.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:35.020]   But the last time I went, it was a much more structured, much more well organized trip.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.940]   Also because I was going to more dangerous parts of Afghanistan.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.940]   So there I did have a fixer who came very recommended.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.380]   And so I knew I was in good hands in general.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.660]   And I think usually, you know, trips are all okay.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:58.660]   We in general haven't heard of situations where people got into a lot of trouble when
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:04.140]   they were going in an organized way with a reliable fixer.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.700]   So that means that, you know, if you use your common sense and do a bit of homework, you'll
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.100]   probably be okay.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.500]   And when you say okay, so a reliable fixer, how do you even go about if someone's listening
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.860]   to this thinking, no, I want to go somewhere, how would you even find that person?
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:24.660]   Well, on Nomadmania, our fixer section is curated to be up to date.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.340]   And we rely on individuals sending information about that.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:36.820]   So, you know, we have travelers who recommend these fixes and either give a good mark or
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.820]   a bad mark.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.700]   You know, we do have some people say, stay away from this guy, you know, but if someone
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.060]   is getting repeatedly good reviews, then yeah, this is something we know about.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:53.740]   There's also a page on Facebook, which is called every passport stamp.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:00.260]   And this is for sort of aficionados of, you know, country collecting, if you want to call
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.260]   it like that.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.060]   And a lot of information is exchanged there.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:10.380]   So that's a valuable resource for up to date information, especially regarding dangerous
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.380]   places.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.500]   I think one of the one of the negative things of the community is that inevitably a lot
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.860]   of the discussion is about these quirky, unusual, dangerous places.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.580]   And you know, no one ever talks about Sweden or I don't know, Costa Rica or, you know,
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.280]   places which are easy to go to and pleasant.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.660]   And I think that's a shame because, okay, Syria is fabulous, but you know, it's definitely
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   not the only country in the world.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.180]   And I certainly think people focus too much on that.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.380]   Well, then maybe I was going to save this for later, but it just came up.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.820]   So are there a few kind of underappreciated places that, you know, you want to make a
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.500]   plug for other than Sweden?
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:59.580]   Yes, I think there are countries which don't get enough attention.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.920]   And I don't know why.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.660]   Maybe they don't market themselves well.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.180]   I think Romania is a hidden gem.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.580]   And you know, people will say, oh, yes, Dracula.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.100]   But I mean, that's that's like 1% of what Romania is about or even less.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:21.860]   I think it's got wonderful natural beauty and some real gems of towns with beautiful
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.640]   colonial centers.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.780]   And you know, people don't generally consider Romania a tourist destination.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.980]   I think that that's a mistake.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.820]   Then I would personally say a country like Laos is fabulous.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.980]   So everyone goes to Thailand because of the beaches and they love it.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:45.180]   And then if you're a landlocked country, you will never be much of a tourist mecca.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:51.020]   But Laos is is sort of really authentic in every way that Thailand isn't.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.340]   So again, you know, I'm not getting a commission from the Laos Tourist Board.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.860]   I just really believe it's underappreciated.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.740]   I also love Tuvalu.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.540]   It's one of my favorites.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.760]   I don't know how many of the listeners will have ever heard of it.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.920]   It's one of the smallest countries in the world.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.660]   It's only got about 10,000 population and it's a two hour flight from Fiji and the plane
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.980]   goes twice a week from Fiji.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.820]   It is an independent country.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:29.020]   And then when the plane leaves, the runway becomes a football field or general, you know,
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.700]   court for all sports for the locals.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.340]   It's a delightful place.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.040]   It's one of the more expensive ones to get to because the flight is the lifeline and
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.600]   they can charge whatever they want for it.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:47.520]   But, you know, if there's one paradise in the world, I would say it's Tuvalu for me.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:52.280]   And it's one of these countries that may not exist for long because of global warming,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.520]   because I think the highest point of Tuvalu is something like four or eight meters above
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   sea level.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.500]   So it go while it exists before it disappeared.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.140]   I'm curious, you know, you did say you don't do a lot of planning, you know, think back
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.340]   to some of those first visits when you didn't know that country or you didn't know anyone
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.340]   there.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.740]   You know, what was your first 24 hours like to kind of get into that point that you could
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.500]   feel like a local?
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   Interesting question.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.660]   Well, look, I'm a born introvert.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.720]   I am not particularly communicative by nature.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.920]   And back in the day, I would be very afraid that there was a lot of trepidation arriving
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.560]   into a new country.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:43.400]   And I think my first task was always to figure out how safe am I really?
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.720]   What vibe do I get from what is going on around me?
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.840]   I think because I studied sociology and I've always been quite perceptive about people,
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:00.200]   I would get within a few hours of being somewhere, I would get a general impression like I can
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.560]   walk around at night on my own or, you know, I shouldn't carry money with me because it
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.640]   looks like it may be dodgy or things like that.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.160]   And then accordingly, I would adapt my style.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   Then I remember I would roll my money into a sort of little pack which used to contain
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.480]   sweets and I'd roll it in and have it in the place of a wallet so that, you know, I wouldn't
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.000]   have a wallet with me at all.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.280]   That was one of my tricks back then.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.620]   I have since become much more confident, though.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.800]   So now I I no longer prepare at all and I no longer have that feeling of trepidation
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.120]   that I used to have.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.840]   So I think this is what is liberating when you travel a lot.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:54.280]   And so, you know, you said you can kind of become a local quickly when you hit the ground.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.000]   Are you going straight to a market?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.140]   Are you trying to sit in a cafe?
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:04.080]   How do you engage with people and spark those conversations and where do you find them?
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.920]   Well, usually I'm going to eat my favorite food.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.160]   So in most countries in the world, not all, I have my local favorites and often you cannot
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.920]   really get them in other countries or if you can, it's not going to be as good.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.880]   So in the Netherlands, for example, the first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to go to
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.640]   the supermarket and I'm going to buy fla.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.080]   Fla is this sort of custody dessert and it only exists in Holland.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.640]   You can't maybe in Belgium, but you're not going to find it anywhere else.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.500]   And you can't take it with you because it needs a fridge.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:50.080]   So you know, Holland, it's like always fla Turkey, where I am now recording this.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.800]   I'm going to land and I'm going to go straight to a kebab place and I'm going to have my
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.560]   iskender kebab, which is yogurt with with meat.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:04.200]   It's it's divine, you know, so I kind of I'm almost conditioned to find my local treats.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.640]   I'm a big foodie.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.980]   So that is the first thing I'll do.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:16.120]   Usually in terms of locals, just by going to a local eatery, you're going to find some
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.800]   conversation, especially in countries outside Europe or the Western world.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.120]   In Europe, this is more of a problem.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:30.400]   People I think are more accustomed to keeping to themselves and it's not always easy to
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.200]   find spontaneous conversations.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.320]   In the States, that works for me because people are are very friendly.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.360]   And then when they when they hear my accent, there's always a bit of a talk about, oh,
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.240]   you're you're from England or something like that.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.920]   And that way, I always end up talking to people in the States.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.080]   But in Europe, this doesn't happen so much.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:56.120]   But nowadays in Europe, I have so many friends in the places I visit.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.960]   Usually I'm traveling to a friend or staying with a friend.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.060]   So you know that that works there.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:07.600]   So at the end of the day, there's always chances to socialize, whether I do know people there
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.960]   beforehand or I don't.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.840]   And I'm going to ask you to keep going down on that list of food a little bit because
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.720]   it may because I skipped breakfast, but also because when I travel, that's my wife sometimes
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.240]   and I try to fit four meals in a day because because food's such an exciting thing.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.760]   Are there places that, you know, if you were told there were only, you know, a dozen places
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.000]   you could go to eat, you know, your final meals, what would be on that list?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.120]   Oh, gosh, you're going to hate me for this.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:44.560]   In the States, the first place I go to is Red Lobster.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.480]   And I know that's that's really a weird one, but that's my favorite in the States.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   In Brazil, it's always feijoada, which is the national dish.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   But it's it's fabulous.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.040]   It's this meat with beans and a lot of other things.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:08.360]   It kind of comes with a lot of added things, which you yourself add into this mix of beans
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   and meat.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.880]   It's it's really good.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.760]   But they don't have that everywhere and they don't have that every day.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   It's considered a sort of special meal.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.700]   So sometimes it's hard to find.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.360]   And how would you go about finding the right place for that?
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.880]   I mean, in America, finding a Red Lobster is easy, but, you know, I imagine in a in
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   a place where, you know, take Turkey, for example, also, there's there's millions of
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.640]   places you can get these these dishes.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.320]   How would you pick one or do you do not care?
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.920]   Well, in Turkey, the chances of getting bad food are very, very small.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.160]   Literally everywhere is is great.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   Well, almost.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.000]   But I would usually just risk it.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.840]   I prefer that to Googling things.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:02.680]   I will Google the nearest Red Lobster, though, but I tend to just go with the flow.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.480]   I don't like planning too much, asking in advance too much.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.400]   I think the beauty of travel is about being spontaneous.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.000]   And so if you end up going somewhere and the food is not good, does it really matter?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It'll be good tomorrow.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.040]   You know, I mean, at the end of the day, it's about taking it easy and not really expecting
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.240]   too much.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.400]   Sometimes you may be disappointed, but you shouldn't even think of it that way.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.340]   We've talked about, you know, both in food and you listed a couple of destinations.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.720]   But I feel like we maybe did a disservice to some of what you've kind of proposed with
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.960]   World Mania, Nomad Mania and on all of the regions.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.200]   So I'm curious, are there places where you think the country is already fantastic?
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.360]   People might know that, but there's a region that is underappreciated, that it's not just
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360]   the country.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.920]   You know, it could be a country that lots of travelers go to, but they're all missing
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.120]   this gem that, you know, you know about it.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.840]   And the fact that you've kind of created a list of regions instead of just countries
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   kind of highlights.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.080]   So there are there under underappreciated regions in, you know, actually appreciated
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.400]   countries that that you'd want to highlight?
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Absolutely.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.720]   Yes, there really are.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.440]   Let me start with Canada.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:28.440]   I recently visited Canada in the summer and I deliberately spent time in places I knew
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.780]   less.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:37.240]   So I saw Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and those are, I would say, probably off the beaten
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.920]   track unless you're Canadian.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.640]   And those those are lovely provinces.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.800]   Nova Scotia is extremely historical.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.720]   It's got a lot of worthwhile sites, both related to fishing, you know, and they've got a lot
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.400]   of culture with that.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:04.480]   But also they've got a few incredible World Heritage sites relating to the history of
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.640]   Canada and how immigration happened and the French speakers versus the English speakers
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.420]   and all that history.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.380]   Some really lovely small villages.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.720]   So I had such a great time and I didn't expect to, to be honest.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:25.260]   So I think the message here is that you can be surprised even when you travel a lot.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   So that's Canada.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:36.200]   In places like Brazil, people usually head to Rio, Sao Paolo, maybe they go to Salvador,
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.560]   which has become a bit popular.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.600]   But for example, I really like the southernmost province a lot, Rio Grande do Sul.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.040]   And the main town there is Porto Alegre.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.000]   The culture there is something between Brazilian and Argentinian.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.320]   It's called gaucho.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.220]   It's sort of like, a bit like the wild west of Brazil, much more of a Western kind of
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.840]   attitude.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.440]   And that is a great province.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:09.540]   And again, I don't think people who visit Brazil would necessarily consider that as
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.440]   an area to go to.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.660]   So that is certainly one.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.800]   Then if we go further south to Argentina, again, people will usually go to Buenos Aires
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.140]   and maybe they'll travel all the way south to see the glaciers and Ushuaia, which is
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:32.020]   the southernmost major town, but they'll be missing on areas further north of Buenos Aires.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.720]   You have places like Salta.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:41.300]   And that is an extremely interesting colonial city, a lot to see and do.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.900]   Also Cordoba, extremely interesting.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:50.320]   It's the second biggest town of Argentina, but surprisingly little tourism.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:57.120]   So I think these are just examples of places where many regions are underappreciated, haven't
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.260]   quite made the, you know, the main tourist sites.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:09.740]   Even with places like France, I recently visited La Rochelle, which is on the Atlantic coast.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.860]   And that area of France, I would say, is generally undervisited.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:20.500]   You have Poitiers, a fantastic town, great architecture, cobblestone roads, authentically
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   French.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:28.000]   But I don't know how many people would really opt to go to that sort of central belt toward
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.900]   the Atlantic.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.260]   People would probably go to Paris or maybe Nice, you know, those areas.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:40.120]   So definitely, I think for people who've already traveled, there are a lot of opportunities
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.820]   to go further and to see so much more.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.480]   It's just a matter of wanting to.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.860]   I've talked to someone the other day who said their favorite trip to every country is their
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:55.460]   second trip because it forces them to skip all the main stuff.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.820]   You know, now we've been to Paris enough times that we're not going to see any tourist destinations.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.660]   We're just kind of like, if we're in Paris, we get to just go do anything.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:11.220]   Yeah, well, I feel now when I revisit places, it's almost like visiting an old friend.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:17.860]   Often I I remember the first visit and I remember myself then, and especially if there's been
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.380]   a long time frame since the first visit.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.060]   You know, it's like going back to the me back then.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.060]   And I always end up thinking, oh, I was so young, I was so inexperienced.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.840]   What did I know back then?
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.660]   And look at me now.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.660]   It's true.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:39.280]   I was in Paris relatively recently, and I found myself so much more relaxed now, really
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:46.020]   just enjoying the vibe rather than feeling I've got to go there and I've got to see that.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:52.060]   So I do think for sure that second, third, fourth visits have a certain value.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.820]   And you can probably understand more about a place than the first time when you're a
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.800]   total newbie and you're struggling to see the sites rather than to perhaps experience
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.720]   the place as a whole.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.100]   Now that you have this optimism that you say you've discovered through travel, are there
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.580]   places that disappointed you?
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:18.220]   There were there were, but usually not because of the people, but mainly because I had, for
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:24.660]   example, very high expectations initially because of other people and what I had heard.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.380]   And then my own experience didn't quite match that.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.340]   But I think there the fault is not the place itself, but more the preconceived ideas I
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.920]   might have had based on some high expectations.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:45.540]   For example, that happened with me in Bhutan, which many people rate extremely highly as
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:53.060]   a sort of Himalayan paradise, very pristine, very authentic.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:57.460]   In my experience there, the first time I went was a total disappointment.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.860]   I thought, well, why am I here in this overpriced place?
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.220]   I didn't feel that much was authentic.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.940]   I felt it was way too structured.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.700]   So I was disappointed.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.420]   And it was because of the expectations.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.860]   Now, the second time I went, when I went to the eastern part of Bhutan, the place redeemed
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:21.580]   itself, because having had the first disappointment, the second time I wasn't expecting much, I
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.860]   thought, oh, well, I'm going to go to Bhutan again, but, you know, I'm not expecting anything.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:32.420]   And then that eastern part of the country was indeed much more authentic, off the beaten
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.100]   track, really friendly locals.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.060]   So yeah, I was then happier again.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.980]   I mean, I guess it goes back to your advice of the lower you think about it in advance,
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.580]   the more everything can surprise you and not let you down.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.340]   And I share your opinion about people there.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.900]   I can't think of very many places, if any, in the world where people aren't nice, kind
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.380]   and friendly and excited to meet you, talk to you and tell you about their country.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.980]   And if you just ask them, you know, what's fantastic about Brazil or anywhere and just
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.460]   be quiet, they'll just go on and on and on.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:11.780]   So it's been it's been a joy to be able to travel some, and I'm now excited to be able
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:17.460]   to to see that same joy through through our kids lens, which is something I've talked
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.300]   about with other people and gives a whole new experience.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.420]   That's the one thing I've never done.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.660]   But but I can imagine that that everything somehow becomes so much more fun.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.860]   And probably things that you as an adult wouldn't notice or wouldn't be surprised by are pointed
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:35.860]   out.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.460]   We've touched on so many different things, any parting advice for people as they think
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:46.060]   about planning their next trip or kind of immersing themselves in wherever they're going?
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:54.100]   Well, one thing I urge people to remind themselves is that when you're a traveler, you're not
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:59.780]   going to a place just to take things from the place you are going and you're going to
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.720]   give things to the place.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:09.580]   And I'm not talking about money, you know, your presence there and you in a way represent
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.660]   your country, your place of origin.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:21.560]   So I urge people, first of all, to look up the history of their own town, think how they
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:28.220]   would answer questions such as what makes your town interesting or what is there in
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.020]   your town that I would enjoy.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:36.860]   And remember that in a way you are an ambassador of your country and your place of origin.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:42.420]   And always remember that, especially when things get rough or if you're disappointed
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.060]   or something doesn't go up to plan.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.380]   Remember that you are not only taking from the place you're visiting, you're there to
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.460]   give back.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:57.860]   And what you should be giving is good energy, positivity, and as much happiness as possible
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.460]   because the world is a difficult place.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:05.580]   So if we can help make it a little bit better, and especially when we're traveling, then
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.740]   we should be.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   This has been fantastic.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.500]   I now want to go plan all kinds of travels.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.280]   So where can people stay on top of all of your travels and everything you're up to?
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.380]   Sign up to nomadmania.com, fill in your profile.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:26.240]   We have a weekly newsletter and through that we communicate with our travelers.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.200]   So you'll get all the news of Nomadmania.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:36.820]   In terms of my personal travels, I am, as I said, an introvert, so I don't really advertise
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   much.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.380]   I do have an Instagram profile.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.300]   It's Harry Nomad.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.540]   So that's 10 letters, Harry Nomad.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.580]   But I don't really update it.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.160]   I'm definitely not a blogger or anything like that.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.360]   I'll just, you know, put up a photo once in a while.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.500]   So I'm not one of these people who's necessarily out there.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:05.700]   But because of that, I've tried to create a community for people to belong into.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:11.660]   So, you know, do register if you like what you see and be part of who we are.
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.660]   Awesome.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.660]   Well, I'm there.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.080]   If anyone registers, you'll see me as well.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.980]   Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.700]   Thank you, Chris.
