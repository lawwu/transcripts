[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode we're going to talk about
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.080]   the not-so-obvious reasons why people want to achieve financial independence and retire early.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.880]   So the fire movement is hot, no doubt. With the bull market since 2009, many people in America
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.960]   and around the world have gotten wealthy by owning stocks, real estate, and other assets.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.520]   And as a result of our massive increase in wealth during a relatively short time period,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.680]   many people are warming up to the fire movement, where they retire in their 30s,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.000]   40s, or 50s to live a pretty good life supported by their investments. And that's my definition of
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.440]   being fire, by the way, to have enough investment income to cover your best life's living expenses.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   So some people go the lean fire route by living relatively frugally. Jacob from Early Retirement
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.000]   Extreme, who helped start the fire movement in 2007, at least the modern day fire movement,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.680]   did that while living in a trailer and living off less than $10,000 a year. And he did that for
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.800]   several years until he decided it was no longer good for him, so he actually went back to work
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.280]   as a quant trader at a big money management firm in around 2010 or 2011. And then other folks are
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.160]   trying to pursue the fat fire route because of their desire to live it up, or because they want
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   to stay and raise a family in a high cost of living area. And that's me and my family. We're
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.720]   still about $50,000 short in passive income to feel completely independent financially. Now,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.360]   I know we're maybe a little bit too conservative or we're a little too aggressive, but hey,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   that's what happens when you have kids. Therefore, our fire journey continues.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.800]   So I thought instead of glorifying financial independence and those who are financially
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.920]   independent, let's have a more difficult conversation. Let's talk about why some people
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.600]   want to pursue financial independence. And the reasons aren't actually as nice as you would think.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.120]   So not all is sunshine and summerized swords in the land of fire. In fact, I would argue that
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.320]   most fire folks are just simply maladjusted misfits who've never been able to fit in.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.320]   So here are 10 not so obvious reasons why people want to achieve fire. One, can't find the right
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.480]   job. Look, nobody quits a job they love, but only truly fortunate people can find such jobs. Most
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.520]   of us are not smart enough. We're not talented enough. We're not connected enough or attractive
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.160]   enough to work at a dream job. Instead, we toil around doing something we dislike or we're just
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   disengaged in simply for the money aching to escape reality. Look, I really enjoyed my finance
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.240]   job for the first like, I don't know, eight to nine years. It was pretty exciting traveling the
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.440]   world, going to Asia, visiting new companies, taking private companies public. But after a
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   while it started getting boring. And then I had to deal with office politics. Then I got passed
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.200]   over for a promotion and a raise. It just didn't feel good. But if I loved my job, if they paid me
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.400]   commensurately with what I was doing, if they respected me as to the level that I thought I
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.280]   deserved, I probably would just continue to stay. And if I could work like, I don't know, 25 hours
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.560]   a week, of course I'd stay. So one, that's the main thing. People just can't find the right job.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.480]   That's why they want to retire early. Two, it's an easier way out. Instead of grinding for decades
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.240]   at a job we hate, it's easier to just give up and quit. Why keep on going as a cancer research
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   scientist after not coming remotely close to finding a cure after 15 years? 20 years? 25 years?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.720]   I mean, how much have we spent on cancer research? And it just doesn't seem like we're making any
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.400]   progress. I don't know what's up with that. That would be kind of demoralizing after a while.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   You know, we might even love our jobs, like I said just now, you know, for the beginning
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   years. But after years of no recognition, that love wears out. So quitting, way easier.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.640]   Three, the desire for instant gratification. We're in a now, now, now society. Instead of putting in
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.120]   our dues to get into the corner office, we want to be the big boss right now. I blame social media,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.200]   the internet, right? Everybody's posting how they're just instant successes. We
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.720]   hear about people's successes much more frequently now. And people are getting richer and wealthier
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.080]   or quicker because of technology. And that just creates a lot of anxiety for us. And it creates
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.040]   a lot of desire to just make it real quick. But as you know, it often takes 10 years or
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.120]   10,000 hours to make true progress. Four, an excuse for being unemployed.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.400]   So look, during the last downturn, a large number of people began to write about location-independent
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.600]   lifestyles, right? Like digital nomad lifestyles that enabled them to break free from the nine to
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.680]   five grind and do what they really want. But the reality is, many of these folks just got fired.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.320]   And they just really wanted a good job and to be accepted by society. But instead, you know what?
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.400]   They made lemonade. So props to them for trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You saw
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   the graduate school applications for business school, for example, surged by 30 to 50% year
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.240]   over year for at least two years during the last financial crisis. And that was an interesting
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.760]   dynamic because that means, ironically, that the people graduated like in, I don't know, 2010, 11,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   12, were actually the people probably who weren't able to hold on to their jobs during the financial
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.360]   crisis. Something to think about. Next, five, an inability to get along with others.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.880]   When you have a difficult time conforming to the rules and being told what to do,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.960]   it's much harder to stay employed, let alone be happily employed. I think fire seekers tend not
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.480]   to be very good at collaboration. Most are also introverts and are very awkward socially. I've
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.120]   been to several conferences. And you know, people are nice and all that, but they're not.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:08.960]   They're just not extroverted. They don't have a charisma that I notice working in day to day
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.560]   life. It's just a little bit of different type of personality or skill set. I don't know. Those
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   with excellent social skills, I've noticed, derive energy from being part of a group. I think that's
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.400]   by definition what being an extrovert is. And the desire for independence from other people
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.600]   simply isn't top of mind. Instead of wanting to read a book for four hours on a Saturday evening,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   they'll want to go out and hang out with folks. Six, there's a realization that time is precious.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   With a median life expectancy hovering around 80 years old, you only have 15 years of retirement
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   life to enjoy if you retire at 65. And if you go through some kind of mishap, or you see friends
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:58.080]   dying, or your parents just miserable, you just kind of become more aware. You have a heightened
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.160]   awareness of time. And therefore, you do everything possible to make sure you're financially stable
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.720]   sooner rather than later. When I was 13, my friend who was 15 died in a car accident.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.480]   And that incident really, really is the catalyst for the reason why I wanted to retire early,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.480]   because it was like a hedge. Just in case, you know, something were to happen to me,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.080]   I want to retire early so I can live my life to the fullest. And it's kind of sad, right?
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.680]   And don't think that I didn't do some cool stuff while I was working. But I just really wanted to
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.920]   get rid of work altogether to be free as soon as possible. Seven, you're tired of making other
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.800]   people richer, right? Uber went public, the CEO is going to make $50 million. He has a $17 million
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.200]   house. Funny, he bought the house from a guy I used to play tennis with. And Uber drivers are
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.120]   making like minimum wage or close to minimum wage. You know, I gave over 500 rides back in 2016,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.880]   I believe. And it was an interesting experience. But it was rough after a while. So I just quit.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.440]   So I think people realize that kind of the workplace dynamics and pay structure is really
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.760]   out of whack. You know, when your CEO is making 1000 times or more than the average employee,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.560]   I mean, I think that's messed up. Do you really need to pay that person that much?
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:27.440]   I could bet you whatever that many of us could just assume the CEO role position at like a large
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.720]   Fortune 500 company, and nothing really would happen. The company would go on about its business
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   as it would because there's a big team out there. All right, eight, declining physical and mental
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.800]   health. That's similar to the realization that time is precious. You know, roughly 1 billion
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.520]   people in the world or 15% have some sort of disability. And for some their disability will
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   get worse over time. As a result, more people are feeling the necessity to live their best lives now.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.360]   And I really want to highlight this point about over 1 billion people in the world have a
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.640]   disability. This is the largest minority group in the world that I don't think gets enough
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.320]   recognition, we need to pay more attention to those who have disabilities, and to be more
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.520]   accommodating and to be more understanding. Because when you have a disability, it's oftentimes no
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.600]   part of your fault of your own, you just are born with it. So let's just be more empathetic and
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.240]   aware of this folks. Nine young children. Man, I really I really didn't realize this until after
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.280]   I became a father in 2017. But I'm glad I realized this now. Well, I'm glad I thought to realize this
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.080]   before I had a son. You know, it's bad enough if you already dislike your job. But life gets even
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.520]   worse if you have to leave the people you care about the most behind and pay strangers to take
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.400]   care of your kids. So you can work in a place you despise, right? That that is just horrible.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.000]   That's a horrible situation. So the desire to fire before kids actually is kind of selfish in
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.400]   comparison. Parental guilt grows internally, especially when you observe some households
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.520]   with a stay at home parent, you know, everything is relative. If everybody, you know, had two
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.000]   working spouses, and you know, drop their kids off to a nanny all day, you know, that'd be one
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.880]   thing, but it's not really the case. And they only grow up once. And then pretty soon they're
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.040]   off to school, you know, at age three for preschool or two, and then kindergarten for sure, at age five
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.520]   or six, if you're following the education laws, United States. And then finally, fire FOMO,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   fire FOMO, fear of missing out. The more people who have achieved fire and write about fire,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.800]   the more people will become aware of this alternative lifestyle. Big media coverage
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.560]   about fire has exploded, folks. I get pinged at least once a week by someone from the local
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:00.400]   newspaper or, you know, a national syndication news. I even just got a email and a call from
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.840]   someone in GQ London, who wants to cover the fire lifestyle. So that might be interesting.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.000]   But the more you see people do it, the more you naturally want to do it. A lot of people,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.640]   they just don't really know what they want until they hear someone do it. And they think, oh,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.880]   that sounds pretty good to me. It's kind of like why staging a house is so effective,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.960]   because a lot of people don't have that imagination when they see the staging.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.360]   They're like, oh, that makes sense. That's a good, good idea. So what was once thought possible only
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:37.680]   for the rich now seems possible for any working soldier with the right financial framework and
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:45.040]   mindset. So there's one final idiosyncrasy of fire that I didn't really realize until right now.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.920]   So as I strive to fulfill my goal of firing a second time around at the end of this year, 2019,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   or definitely by 2020, I've come to the realization I've been constantly chasing a
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   moving financial target. In 2012, at the age of 34, my goal was to achieve $100,000 in retirement
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.720]   income within three years post work. And then after my wife left her job in 2015,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.240]   I increased our retirement income goal to 200,000. Then after our son was born in 2017,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:23.040]   our retirement income goal jumped to 300,000. So that's why we're $50,000 short or thereabouts.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.560]   So does this mean if we are blessed, praise be with a second child, our retirement income target
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.520]   would now jump to 400,000? I mean, if so, that's crazy. I'm never going to be able to relax and
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:41.840]   smell the roses because generating 400,000 in non 401k and non IRA income is a Herculean task.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.480]   And I can't even pick up my boy sometimes without feeling soreness in my back.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:53.280]   What the heck am I going to do? So this desire to build an ever greater financial buffer and fire
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   is one of the biggest inconsistencies and peculiarities I've experienced since leaving
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.760]   corporate America. Maybe wanting more is just a part of the human condition. Or maybe this desire
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:14.160]   to provide is is the inherent part of the primary breadwinner's desire to provide and that's me.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.040]   Or perhaps I'm just simply too afraid to let my family down because I just can't imagine
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   having my wife have to go back to work, especially if we have a second kid.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.280]   And I can't imagine myself having to be forced to go back to work, which is why my investments
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.400]   are quite diverse and conservative. So this is something interesting to know. Once you get to
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.440]   financial independence, and once you get the guts to leave your day job and live off your retirement
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.760]   income, you might not be satisfied with what you have over time if your life changes. And I think
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   that biggest x factor is providing for kids and taking care of your aging parents. So that's about
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:14:00.160]   it, folks. Just be aware that not everything is as amazing as it seems. You know, life is complicated.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.800]   Nothing is ever straight in line. There are always little twists and turns that you're probably not
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.880]   going to be aware of until you experience it for yourself. This is why I'm trying to
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.920]   give you guys as real of a perspective as possible. Now, do I regret leaving work at 34?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.640]   I don't regret it. I don't regret it. I think I would have regretted it if I left at 40 and if I
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.200]   never had my son, because I had him really late when I was 39 and almost 40. So I don't regret it.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   And I don't think you will regret living a fire lifestyle too if you can save aggressively,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.120]   invest properly, and figure out some alternative income streams. There's not a day that goes by
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.960]   that I'm not thankful for having Financial Samurai and having this community to interact with.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.680]   I mean, it gives me something intellectually to do every single morning. And then I get to spend
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.080]   time with my family and, you know, go exercise and just do random life things. There's really
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.000]   only one life to live. So you just want to make sure you're living it purposefully,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.240]   as purposeful as possible, and really try to plan ahead and don't don't put up with crap.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.360]   If you're not happy, because I think you're going to look back. And if you didn't stand up for
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.680]   yourself, or if you had to put up with crap longer than you thought you you'll regret that inaction.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.560]   Take action. Keep on listening. Keep on learning. And I wish you guys good luck. Thanks.
