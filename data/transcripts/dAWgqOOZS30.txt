[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   [music]
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.640]   Pastor John, in light of our previous podcasts, and especially episodes 19 and 21,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.440]   there's a question about whether or not we can glorify God in our desire to enjoy Him,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.840]   even when we do not feel the joy.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.040]   Or do I bring glory to God only when I experience the joy?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.640]   In other words, maybe this is the best way to ask the question,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.240]   when you say God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in Him,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.640]   would it be more accurate to say that God is most glorified in me
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.840]   when I look to be most satisfied in Him? Does that make sense?
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840]   Yeah, it totally makes sense, and the answer is no,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240]   but it's way more complicated than that.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.840]   So let me back up and say yes to the first part.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:51.040]   The first part, I think, was, can I glorify God in my desire to enjoy Him,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.840]   even when I don't feel joy? Now, the answer to that is yes.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.440]   But here's the reason it doesn't contradict Christian hedonism.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.640]   There are levels of worship. There are levels in our emotions
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.840]   of how we honor God with them. The top level is we're just all there, right?
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.440]   We are white-hot for God. We're free. We're unhindered.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440]   We're rooted in the truth, and our emotions are free,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.040]   and we're able to sing and obey and bless, and we're just all there,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.640]   and we love Him, and we're totally serving Him.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   And clearly, God is honored when that's the case,
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840]   and our emotions are all there, and we're enjoying Him.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   Down a level where we really live in and out of that
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.240]   is when we lack that kind of intensity, which we do most of the time, I would say.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   Sorrow for the fact that we don't feel that way honors God.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.440]   Sorrow and regret that I'm not there is a way of honoring God,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:09.040]   but that sorrow is an echo of the joy, the seed of which is still in us.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   In other words, we have tasted and seen that the Lord is good.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.640]   That taste has become temporarily dull.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.040]   It's not having its effect on the tongue of our soul.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.240]   We know it. The only reason we feel any regret,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   the only reason we desire for more is that we've tasted it,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   and the remnant is there in us.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.240]   And so I think when I say there needs to be, there should be joy,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   I mean that kind of leftover of what was there before
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.040]   that is enough to make us regret that it's not there,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.440]   and long for it to be there, and pray that it be there,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.640]   that's joy too, and that honors God too.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240]   And then there are seasons, this would be the third level way down,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.440]   is we're so numb that we scarcely have any memory.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.840]   We can't even function. This is depression in its worst.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.440]   And I think God is honored there if we wait for Him,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.640]   and don't curse Him, and don't turn aside to idols.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.440]   If we're just waiting, because that ability to wait for Him,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   feeling virtually nothing, feeling numb in our soul,
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.240]   is rooted in something that God has done in us,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   and is real and authentic.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.040]   So that's my yes to the first question,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   but my no to the last question, namely,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.240]   shouldn't we revise the mantra,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   "God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him,"
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.040]   and rather say, "God is most glorified in us
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.440]   when we look to be most satisfied in Him," is no.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   Because I'm saying, yes, God is glorified
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   when we look to Him to be most satisfied in Him,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840]   but no, not most satisfied.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   In other words, the word "most" there is not to deny what they're affirming.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.840]   I'm affirming with them that looking to Him to be satisfied in Him
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.640]   honors Him, because we've tasted that satisfaction,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   and a seed of it remains in us.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   But I am saying, don't ever, ever stop there.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.840]   God wants us to be hot, not lukewarm.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   And so God is more glorified by a person
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   who sees enough of Christ's beauty
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.240]   that his whole soul is engaged.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   And therefore, to say, "God is most glorified
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.440]   when we look to Him to produce that kind of love,"
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.840]   rather than experiencing that kind of love,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   would, I think, be an undermining of the very commandment itself.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.040]   So we glorify God in sorrow,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.440]   and we glorify God in waiting in the dark seasons,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.640]   but God is most glorified in us
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.240]   when we experience wholesale mind, body, soul joy.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.440]   Yes, and I assume that that's the case
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.840]   because God does away with depression in heaven.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   If He were most glorified by our being--
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.240]   hanging on by our fingernails while we're in a season of darkness,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.640]   then I think heaven would be a season of darkness,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.440]   and we'd all be hanging on by our fingernails in heaven
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.640]   because that's the way God gets most glory for eternity.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.240]   But that's not.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.840]   Now, if somebody wants to really press on this and say,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   "All of the universe and all of history
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.040]   is the way God gets the most glory,"
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   namely, when the totality of everybody's experience
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.840]   is folded in and the tapestry is seen as a whole,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.640]   then I'm going to say, "Okay, if that's what you mean, yes."
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.040]   But that's not what we're talking about.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   We're talking about where are we all going?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.840]   Where are we going so that God gets most glory?
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.240]   Not the totality of the tapestry,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   but rather where are we going?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   And where we're going is into an experience of perfection
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.240]   where God will, at that moment, be most glorified in us,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.040]   and that will be a moment of total satisfaction in Him.
