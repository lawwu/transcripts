[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   Hello, and welcome to the Everyday Educator, a podcast where we explore the beauty, challenges,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.960]   and calling of classical Christian homeschooling through classical conversations. I'm your
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.260]   host, Kelly Wilt, and today's episode is for the parents who are standing on the edge
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.260]   of a big decision, the ones who might feel the tug to homeschool but wonder, am I really
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.500]   ready for this? And if you've ever wrestled with doubts, questions, or fears about starting
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.360]   this journey, you, my friend, are definitely not alone. In today's conversation, I'm sitting
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.100]   down with two moms who have been in your shoes. Lynn and Deedee, thank you so much for being
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.560]   my guest here today. Can you take a moment to introduce yourselves to our listeners, and
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.520]   Lynn, we'll start with you. Hello, my name is Lynn Patti. I have been homeschooling for
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.140]   13 years. Eight of those have been with CC, with classical conversations. My children,
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.120]   I have five children, and they go from seven to 17. My husband is a software developer, so
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.700]   he works at home, we homeschool at home, and our house is definitely very busy. It's like
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.060]   Grand Central Station. And I am just very, very passionate about the subject, about getting
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.780]   moms engaged with that conversation about homeschool, where to start, what to do. I love this stuff.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.600]   So yeah, Deedee, go ahead. Okay. Hi, everyone. My name is Deedee, and I have four kids from 10
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.760]   years old to 17 years old to 17 years old. My husband works at the bank, and we have been in
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.780]   Charlotte for about 12 years now. I used to come from corporate America background, so we lived in
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.300]   California, Florida, and currently Charlotte for my job moving around. So homeschooling now has really
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.400]   been an opportunity to just feel settled as a family and kind of reclaim my sense of motherhood,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.480]   honestly. So I do enjoy talking about this as well, because it's easier than you think to start.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.060]   I like that. I like that intro to what we're going to talk about today. And, you know, during this
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.360]   podcast today, we're going to talk about what, quote unquote, readiness really looks like and how to
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.340]   prepare for homeschooling, both practically and spiritually, and how God's grace fills all of the
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.040]   gaps that we might feel so deeply. If you've ever asked yourself, am I enough? Is this enough? This
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.840]   podcast today is for you. So if you're watching, grab your coffee or your laundry basket, because we've all
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   been there, and settle in. And let's talk about having the courage to begin even before you feel
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.920]   completely ready. So ladies, I'm going to start with this question. And Lynn, I'm going to direct this to you
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.720]   first. What first sparked your interest in homeschooling? And how did you know that homeschooling
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   was the right choice for your family? Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, we were living in Los Angeles at the
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.500]   time. It was 2012. And I had come from a public, I was an educator and in public schools. I was actually
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.420]   a music teacher. But I was like, let's go tour the local school where my daughter, Emma would go.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.520]   And we went and I was definitely like, Oh, I don't think this is good. You know, and then it's like,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.240]   well, there's no way we can do private school because that's just out of our budget. And so my friend who
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.540]   had moved up to Washington State, she's like, you know, we're going to do this thing called classical
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.700]   conversations. And I was like, you know what, kindergarten isn't even required in the state
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.000]   of California. Like you don't even have to like, put your kid down as a homeschooler in kindergarten.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.500]   So I was like, I'll just do that. I'll just do what my friend Emily did. And that was it. Like,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.280]   that was literally it. The other thing that was interesting is that the school where she would
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.540]   have gone for public school, their kindergarten program was like an hour and 45 minutes or
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.820]   something like that. So I had a two year old and a six month old, I was like, I'm gonna literally get
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.460]   her ready for school, take her there, come home, turn around. I can't put a baby down for a nap. I
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.340]   can't do, you know, the morning nap or whatever. And I'll have to go back. And I was like, I'll just
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.260]   homeschool. It's just easier. I love that. I love that. Devi, what first sparked your interest
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.260]   in homeschooling for your family? Well, I would say it was primarily the idea that I could reclaim my
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.120]   family, my family time. So I was working corporate America when that idea first came across. It was
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.480]   actually at a Bible study and this mom probably wearing a jumper. I mean, that was love. It was like,
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.200]   you should consider homeschooling. And I was like, what? No, never. And I think that was just the
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.060]   first seed that was planted. And after the years of working like 70 hour work weeks and yes, in
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.180]   California, everything's like 45 minutes an hour. Like it was crazy, but I didn't have the option of
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.060]   homeschooling at that time as early in my career. And I was like, okay, I've got to do this. But honestly,
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.300]   I think that time really prepared my heart to desire it more and to just sink into the gift that
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.840]   it is. So what sparked my interest is I want to have more time with my family, but also I think
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.620]   we're just created to want to be with our kids, right? I feel like it's God's design for a mother to
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.320]   want to be with her kids. And homeschooling was a great opportunity to do that.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.880]   I love that. And I, I, my story resonates with you, with both of yours in that I had this desire
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.620]   for something different for my family. I had seen different educational options because I'm a former
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.320]   public school kindergarten teacher. And so I looked at them and thought, Oh, is this really what I want?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.660]   And I think it was driven by the same desire that you're expressing, Didi, where I looked at the amount
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.500]   of time that my kindergartners were with me during the day. And I was, I was a little jealous for that
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.140]   time with my own children. I agree with you that God creates us with that desire to want to be there
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.040]   and speak into the lives of our children. But I have to say as a kindergarten teacher, I was a little
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.900]   fearful about bringing that experience into our home. So I'm curious, did you guys experience any
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.520]   doubts or fears before you started homeschooling? And what steps did you take to overcome them? So
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.300]   Didi, what about you? Any doubts or fears?
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:01.500]   What helped me was a neighbor homeschooled and she kept telling me over and over, it's not a permanent
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.800]   decision. And I would say the fear was that if I do this, there's no going back, you know, like I'm in
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.140]   this black hole of homeschoolers that I'll never come out the same. And, you know, that's actually a
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:21.780]   wonderful thing. But it, I was so fearful of, I'll never get the charter school that I was into. I'll
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.760]   never like all the things that I've worked for, to get my kids into the, you know, magnet school,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.280]   they were in a STEM school. I'll never be able to go back to that. And it was, it was a lot of just kind
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.040]   of letting that go and trusting that if, if God is opening this door, he can open the next one at the
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.400]   right time. And so really faith was a huge part of it. And my neighbor just encouraging me, my neighbor,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.640]   Nikki, she was just like, it's not permanent. You don't have to do this forever. And I think that just took
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.720]   the pressure off. So that was super helpful. I love that. Just the thought of a, of a neighbor
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.320]   who's speaking truth into you, just shows the value of good community and surrounding your good
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.640]   community. Lynn, what about you? What about you? Were there any doubts and fears and what did you do to
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.180]   overcome those? Yeah. I feel like there were doubts and fears like before homeschool and after,
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.560]   you know, like, yes, agreed after you start, it's like, Whoa, I didn't even know I should be afraid
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:29.420]   of that. Um, no, I'm just kidding. Oh, well, I'm not kidding. But anyway, yeah, I was, I was scared.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:37.440]   I think I, I struggled with, um, being fearful of what people thought of me. Um, I, I do, I do think
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.200]   that I'm a little bit rebellious, but then I really do. I'm like, Ooh, what are they going to think?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.700]   You know, what is this person, this family member, this, whatever, um, that was certainly in there.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.420]   Um, I doubted my ability to, to just to educate my daughter, you know, and I think what Dee said about
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:01.400]   how it's not a permanent decision, um, is really important because, you know, we aren't given 13
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:08.080]   years and, and, and, you know, say, Oh, you have to do all of this for 13 years. I mean, you might,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:16.980]   but really it's today, right? It's just today. And, um, yeah, I think before I homeschooled or at the
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:24.080]   very beginning, I just had very little vision. Um, I just hadn't sat down to be like, what is the vision
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.980]   for this? But in the end, I think that that is how like God really wanted it to be for us. Um,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.440]   that I wasn't going to set out this, you know, big, huge thing TM. It was just going to be today
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:43.180]   and just get through today. And then if you are adding babies and adding moves or building businesses
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.540]   or what else, all of that stuff really only have today because a lot of those things become very
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:57.640]   uncertain. Sleep is very uncertain. Um, so yeah, I, I had a lot of fears, but, um, I didn't know it would
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:04.340]   last so long. I really didn't like when DD was saying, um, that's like a happy surprise that I'm
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:14.100]   still here heading into year 14 and, um, we're still doing it, but, um, I definitely, I, I feel
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.560]   like I overcame those fears or the Lord helped me overcome those fears with community. It was a huge,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:28.340]   huge puzzle piece. Um, and the times that my fear or doubting was allayed was directly related to the
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.940]   amount of time I was spending in the word and prayer and community. Um, and my husband and I being, um,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.380]   really intentional about our time together. Uh, I can't say enough about that. I feel like
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.980]   I haven't heard a lot of people talk about that, but, um, yeah, just getting his, cause he does have
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:53.180]   vision. Um, and I'm not sure he was like 100% on board when we started, but he was like, Oh yeah,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.460]   do your thing, babe. You know, like whatever. Um, and then as he got more on board, his vision,
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:06.200]   I really relied on that or really rely on it even today. Yeah. I love that. Go ahead.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.660]   I was just going to say, I love what you said there about vision. I feel like that's such a good word
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.260]   because I love the scripture. That's like, for lack of vision, people perish. And that's something
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.720]   that I didn't know I needed honestly. And I was so caught up and like, but it has to be like this.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   It has to be school at home. I didn't realize the freedom I had to cast a vision for my family
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   and my friend Diana. So kind of walking closer to making that decision. My friend Diana gave me this
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:44.820]   book called teaching from rest and it gave me this vision for relationship, which is what the deeper
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.240]   thing I was wanting. So it just kind of came together. And yes, my husband was very much like,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:57.520]   so we're, we're doing this. And that was huge. It was huge to have that support and that vision,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:05.740]   that he had as well. I agree. I agree. I think looking back now, having a spouse who could
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.860]   understand the reasons why I was drawn to homeschooling and who was there to say, all right,
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:20.320]   let's do this thing together. That was key for me. I do think, thinking back on my story and where God
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.460]   brought me from before homeschooling, one of my fears was that, and I think one of you already
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.380]   alluded to this, that I wouldn't be able to replicate a school atmosphere in our home.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:39.300]   And now that's laughable to me because I think that's not what it's about. It's not about creating
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:48.400]   a school at home. It's about making life educational and fun. And having those experiences together,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   not necessarily bound to, you know, a desk sitting in a room, but that the classroom, our classroom is
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   the world. And so I think that was one of the things. So unfortunately, that information did not
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   come to me until later, like what Lynn was describing, how, you know, the farther you get in,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:15.300]   the more questions you have and the more realizations you have. And so I did at first try to prepare our home
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:22.080]   for homeschooling by making it as much like that classroom environment that I knew. I made the mistake
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:29.920]   of reverting to my comfortable paradigm and bring that environment home. But I'm curious, as you guys
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.700]   began homeschooling, did you have something similar or how did you prepare your home for, you know, and your
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:45.540]   schedule, quite frankly, for homeschooling? Because when we came into homeschooling, I had a baby. I had a squirrely
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:52.940]   four-year-old boy and a squirrely six-year-old boy who were all, everyone was full of energy and perhaps me not so much
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:14:00.360]   because they took all my energy. But we had to definitely do some schedule shifting and we had to think about life in new
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:09.080]   ways. So I'm curious, I'm curious, Dede, what, what was life like? What was home like? How did you prepare for
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.740]   homeschooling once you guys made that decision? And then Lynn, I'm curious to hear your thoughts as well.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:23.580]   Well, yeah, we, I felt like we always homeschooled in a way and that's kind of, I guess, the advice or
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:29.340]   encouragement I would like to give to moms, you're already doing this. You might also be sending your
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:35.320]   child to traditional school, but I don't know of a mom that's not teaching their children the ABCs or
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:42.180]   manners or how to be kind to your siblings, you know, so you just get more of that. And what you were
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.360]   saying, Kelly, about the idea of bringing school home, that's definitely what I had in mind. But honestly,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:54.180]   the best conversations have been in between math and English and those spontaneous moments where we're
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.100]   just talking and learning so much and making connections about all of the subjects. We're not
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.240]   just focused, zeroed in on how to diagram the sentence. And we do that, but then it just, it kind of rounds
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.980]   out into this whole, like school, the world is our homeschool, so to speak. So the way I prepared
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:19.460]   is I just kept doing what I was doing. We were memorizing scripture. I remember we went to the
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.800]   Billy Graham library when we first moved to North Carolina and it gave us this bookmark, the ABCs of
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.740]   the Bible. And at the time I was still taking my kids to traditional school. My oldest had just gotten
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:39.200]   into, um, actually my second was in a STEM academy and I was like, okay, we're going to just say this on the
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.760]   way to school. And my kids still remember that like, oh yeah, we did do that. And that just grew
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.000]   and grew and grew until that was primarily, you know, what we did at home. But, um, I feel like
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.120]   God just put on my heart, what I was already doing was enough. It was a good foundation. And then finding
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.340]   CC obviously was, was helpful because I feel like I kind of did a couple of things. I did like the
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.900]   unschooling. I was like, we're just going to do it. I started with five in a row. I was like,
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.400]   everybody tries it. And that's all we need. But at the time, all of mine were in elementary,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.320]   so it kind of worked well. But then I thought I am very all over the place. I'm a little scattered.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.120]   So finding the classical conversations curriculum was great. Cause it was like, no, we can just
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.100]   follow this, put my mind at rest. And it was wonderful. I don't know if that answers your
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.500]   question. I feel like I was all over the place. It does. Lynn, what about you? What about you?
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.700]   How did you guys prepare your life, your home, your schedule once you decided, okay, we're all in,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:47.560]   this is the thing we're going to do it. Yeah. I remember, you know, transforming our dining room
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.540]   and we had some built-in bookshelves. So those ended up being where all of our materials went.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:59.920]   You know, talking to my husband about, he's got to get over to his studio, but by a certain time,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.640]   because I want to start at a certain time, which now that I'm again, starting year 14,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:11.260]   it's just so hilarious because I'm like, we, our schedule is like, you know, with all the kids and
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:18.080]   all the needs. But, um, I did, I absolutely, I, I resonate with the wanting to bring quote unquote
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:25.640]   traditional school home. That absolutely was a thing. Um, I can remember early on, um, Emma was,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.600]   I had asked her, she's, she was six and she, um, was supposed to empty the dishwasher and she took
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.960]   the plates and the forks and the knives and the spoons, and maybe even a cup. And she laid them
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:45.600]   out on the floor and made this really big caterpillar. And I remember this very like Jekyll and Hyde moment
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.200]   where I was like, but your job was to empty the dishwasher. And then this other side, which I think
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.760]   is my homeschool persona was like, Oh my gosh, this is amazing. She's so creative, like blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.280]   So like the reason I bring that up is because I think, I don't know if it was that incident or
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.760]   another, but my husband was like, well, that was her school for today. And you know, that idea creeping
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.680]   in that there's just so much of every day that is school, which is what Didi was talking about too.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:23.440]   Um, and then, uh, being in the car is a big one, even for homeschoolers, when we are like supposed to
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.080]   be having these conversations in our school rooms, in our whatever, but then it's in the car where a
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.280]   kid asks about, you know, the pineal gland or something. And then you just go from there or the
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.160]   phases of matter. These are just from yesterday. Um, you know, stuff like that. It just, it just goes.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   So to prepare, I think, I just think about that first time homeschooler mom. Yeah, you got to prepare.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.080]   And if it means that you're going to make a desk or going to make a table or going to make it look
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.880]   like school, you know what, go for it because you got to go through to get there. You know,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:09.040]   you have to do those things to figure out what is my style. What is my vibe for lack of a better word?
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.920]   Yeah, absolutely. I totally agree with that. I think, you know, looking, looking back, I didn't know
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:21.420]   what I needed for our individual family until we had begun walking the homeschooling path and it took
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:29.640]   time. And one thing that I wish that I could speak to that Kelly from 20 years ago. Wow. Is that I wish
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.820]   that I had given more grace to myself to discover what it was that I needed to do in order to provide
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.160]   the best learning environment for our family. And I felt like almost like what Didi was saying,
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.500]   like it had to be like the magic switch that we did forever. And however we began,
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.820]   that was how we were going to finish. And now I look back and think, Oh, Kelly, you know, I wish,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.900]   I wish that I'd had, and I know we all have similar regrets, right? Now that we've walked to this path
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.960]   for a while, how we wish we could go back and say certain things to ourselves and, you know,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.560]   communicate like have grace. It will work out, you know, just start walking and align yourself with
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.460]   good community, align yourself with great curriculum. And most importantly, align yourself with God's
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:24.100]   calling, um, align yourself with him and, um, allow him to speak to you and walk it out friends. I mean,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:30.440]   really that is, that is the thing. I'm glad that at the beginning, um, I was willing to take the steps,
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.600]   but there was, there were fears associated with that, that we wouldn't be enough that, um, I would
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.060]   do something wrong. And now I look back and think, Oh, I wish that I had more grace for myself. I wish
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.040]   that I had more grace for my family. Like what you were describing when, um, where there were teachable
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.160]   moments that God afforded us. And maybe I stole the joy of my child because I was in this, like,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.320]   Oh, we have to accomplish learning objectives. Yeah. That's right. And now I'm like, Oh, you know what?
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.180]   The grace of God was sufficient even for those moments. And even in those times where, man,
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:11.300]   I love some gaps because I just didn't know the Lord has been kind to fill every single one of those
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.880]   for his glory. So I think we've kind of hit on another part of the homeschooling experience that
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:25.040]   kind of needs to be spoken about, and that is our families. So how did family dynamics shift for both of
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.020]   you once you began homeschooling and what helped you during that time to be able to ease the transition
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:37.660]   from life before homeschooling into this brave new world that you had chosen to enter with your family?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.940]   So Lynn, I'm curious your thoughts about that. What did you guys do during that transition? You've
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.300]   already told us that you set up an environment, but what about with your family?
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.100]   Yeah. I, uh, these issues pop up real quick when you start, but, um, for me, one of the things,
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:22:00.620]   and I'm going to get a little bit like brass tacks here, um, is the house, the cleanliness of the house
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:07.300]   that became a real issue. Um, I had little littles and, you know, I know some people are like,
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.720]   we, we are going to teach our kids to clean the house when they're four years old. And yes,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.340]   of course, but I'm sorry, they just don't do a great job when they're four. Um, so, uh, we got
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.060]   a cleaning lady. That was a big one. Um, we budgeted for it and we are Dave Ramsey people over here. So
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:30.360]   it came at a cost. It absolutely did. And we gave up other things, but I knew if I didn't have someone
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:37.820]   helping me with like the nuts and bolts, laundry, cleaning, whatever that I would, I, I found that my
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:43.480]   pattern was to sacrifice the homeschool to clean because when the kids are little, they do play
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:50.600]   and they play really, really well. And so it could be nine, 10, 11, 12, one, and I'm just doing all of
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.360]   the doing. Um, and I was like, if we're going to be intentional about this at all, I'm going to have
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:03.160]   to take that off my plate. So I did get a cleaning lady. Um, you know, I had to switch from, I thought I
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.480]   was an extrovert all these years, but when you're with the kids all of this time, I'm actually like,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.840]   I really needed some space. So we also did like, um, I don't know if it was like one afternoon a week
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   or something while the baby was sleeping, I would go out, um, by myself. I can remember sleeping in my
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.340]   van in the Trader Joe's parking lot for two hours or like whatever. Oh, that was you before. Yeah,
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:37.120]   exactly. Um, this was before the phone was such a draw, like to scroll or whatever. So I really did
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.780]   sleep. I really just, um, needed that. Uh, I can remember getting pedicures was a big deal. I would
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.280]   like, you know, not once a week, but like once a month. And, and that was like, and I would sleep
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:57.880]   during those two. Ha ha. Um, anyway, uh, yeah, I think that, uh, date nights, I've already kind of
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.660]   said this before we budgeted for that, found a great sitter to work with. Um, that was so important.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:11.060]   I felt like my husband needed a space where he just had me like, just like really had my focused
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.940]   attention. Um, because he was building a business, which means we were building a business together.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.840]   Um, so that was part of it. But then I also needed to say, you know, Hey, what do you think about this
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.040]   kid or that kid? And we still do that to this day. Date nights are a big deal. We just don't need a
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:33.800]   babysitter anymore. Cause we got like three built-in ones, which is awesome. Um, so, uh, yeah, I think
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:42.340]   so. Didi, how about you? Yeah, I, I would say what changed was, was really my attitude about it. So
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.740]   my kids, my older kids were like, Oh, mommy, can you please homeschool us? Because the neighbor was
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:55.480]   homeschooled that I was referring to earlier. And I was like, what? No, you know why? Because you think
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:03.120]   it's going to be easier and it will not be, I will not make it easier for you. So, and also my husband's
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   from Nigeria. So we have that cultural, you know, background school is so important. Traditional
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:16.900]   school, that structure, that classroom setting, that respecting your elders and teachers. It's,
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.740]   it is kind of life school too, right? So the things, the soft skills that they learn in that environment
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:28.500]   are so important. And I was like, I will not homeschool you. I repeat, I will not do this for you.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:38.200]   And then after feeling like I could do this for a year, I could try it. I saw that my kids were just
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.140]   wanting it so much. They were ready to do the work. They would wake up, they would read the books. We
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.480]   started with a boxcar children and this is a summer. We started like just in the summer to try it out.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.960]   And they wanted to do all the experiments that this other curriculum had laid out for us
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.620]   on account of the books. And I just remember to this day, like very simple things that you could
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:06.480]   do at home became our classroom. And it was just like kind of walking into what God had already laid
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:14.200]   out before me. Right. So it was more of a heart issue for me and just the attitude of I can do this well
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.820]   and I can, I can love Lord, I can love my kids. And it just, I don't know, it just unfolded.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:29.120]   I feel like the, the way that I wanted to prepare was not necessarily the best way. Like that idea of
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.500]   the, you're climbing a ladder, but it's against the wrong wall. And I kept thinking, no, I have to have
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:41.540]   all this curriculum color coded and, and the cleaning and everything, you know, just in order. But I think
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.160]   God just said, there's another way and, um, help me understand that. So really it was an attitude.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.880]   It was a heart adjustment. And that was, that was huge.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:57.940]   Hey everyone. We want to interrupt this show to tell you more about this semester's sponsor,
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:04.160]   Judson college. Judson college is an amazing fit for a CC student because they really do focus in
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.880]   on our three uniques classical Christian and community. Listen to their mission statement.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.260]   They say equipping students to give their lives for the cause of Christ in the church,
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:22.640]   among the nations, and in every aspect of society. Let me tell you a little bit about what they mean
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.940]   when they say every aspect of society. I know sometimes we think of a Christian college and we
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.360]   think, okay, you're just teaching me to go into vocational ministry. Well, guess what?
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.480]   We spoke with a representative from Judson college and he shared with us that it's more
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:41.520]   than just official ministry. They believe that every believer is equipped and needs to be equipped
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:48.020]   for ministry, wherever their feet land. So whether that means the marketplace or someone's church,
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.920]   Judson college has a wide variety of degrees for students to choose from,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:58.280]   including 25 majors, as well as five years, bachelor's to master's programs. And each of these programs are
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:04.040]   taught by exceptional faculty who are experts in their field and passionate about investing in the
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.860]   lives of their students. They want their students to leave equipped theologically and professionally
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:14.700]   for whatever career God wants them to pursue. To find out more about what Judson college has to offer,
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:20.960]   visit judsoncollege.com forward slash distinctives. And again, thank you to Judson college for sponsoring
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.440]   this semester of the everyday educator. Let's get back to the show.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:33.220]   Right. Right. I remember, um, struggling with feelings of guilt. Um, whenever we first started
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.780]   homeschooling, because I am a raging extrovert by nature. And I experienced something similar to you,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:45.860]   Lynn, where I just needed to sit and look at a wall. And I felt badly about that because I needed to
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:52.120]   decompress from a day with active, you know, wiggly squirrely children all day long who needed me, um,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:58.880]   so much. And I think Didi, if I had been wise, like what you're describing, and I had my heart posture
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   needed to be adjusted. Um, because I think I was being, I was being led around by the tyranny of the urgent.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:15.140]   And I did not allow my days to be spirit field filled. I had a rigid schedule and I was like,
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:25.120]   oh my goodness, we're math from eight to, um, eight 59. And then we have Bible. And I just look back and
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:31.560]   I'm like, oh, you know, I wish that I wish that in preparing for homeschooling, I'd had a better
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.240]   understanding of what life school looks like. And the fact that I can do these things and I can make
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:44.000]   my environment perfect for what I thought would perfect would look like. But the reality is you've
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.100]   got to start with your heart and then have to take steps to allow yourself grace to be that parent that
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.200]   your children need. And I agree with you, Lynn, like for me, like the house, like that's a big deal
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:03.420]   because suddenly, you know, you're not going out, you're in, right. And so you're looking at things
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:09.600]   and sometimes things can try to be more important than people in our lives. And we have to cast that
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.180]   down. So I really applaud both of you, the wisdom that you exercise to have the right heart posture
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:21.240]   and to provide the right learning environment so that you weren't distracted by things that maybe were not
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:28.320]   the most important thing at that particular moment. Um, I'm, I'm curious, Dede, you mentioned the box
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:34.920]   card children, one of my favorite series and a huge part. I know as I look around, like there were stacks
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:41.240]   of books, the cabinet behind me is full of books, my children have books in their rooms. And as a former
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:48.020]   classroom teacher, I really, before we discovered classical conversations, felt a tremendous amount of
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:55.520]   overwhelm because there are so many options available to us as homeschoolers. Um, you know, and we do
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.600]   sometimes feel that invisible pressure to find the magic bullet that we'll use forever and ever that
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:11.300]   will make all of our children, you know, surgeon, surgeon, president. Um, and I'm curious, um, for both of you,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:17.480]   you know, looking back, what advice would you give to parents who maybe feel similarly to how I did?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:24.120]   They feel a little overwhelmed by all of the curriculum options that are available. I'm curious,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:30.880]   Lynn, what your thoughts are about that. Yeah, I think, um, you know, if you talk to anybody about
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.200]   homeschool for just a minute, you probably will get to curriculum pretty quickly. But then when I have in
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:43.600]   mind this, this prototype mom, who's just dipping her toe and just like, wait, is this right for my family?
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.460]   I feel like curriculum wouldn't necessarily be her first thing. I mean, maybe, yeah. What worksheets do
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:58.260]   I use or something? But, um, you know, when I dove in, um, it was like, I had to, I had to kind of get my
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.980]   hands on it for a while before I was like, Ooh, now I want to talk about curriculum and what goes.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.920]   But what, one thing that I had a friend and this wasn't even at the beginning. So now as a friend,
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:14.480]   I will tell everyone, you know, to really sit down and create some kind of a philosophy of homeschool,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:21.400]   you know, what, what, what do I want for these kids? And, and maybe even if you are a researcher,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:28.620]   even if you're not to look into the different, um, styles of homeschool, because that will inform,
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:36.700]   you know, how you, um, run your homeschool. And I do think, um, you know, our philosophy as an example,
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.760]   when the kids were really little, our philosophy was developing lifelong learners who love adventure
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.280]   and who give generously. Um, and this is all under the umbrella of, um, the gospel, you know,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:55.720]   obviously, maybe not, obviously I should say that, um, you know, having that philosophy can drive your
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:02.060]   curriculum choices. Then you have to sit with the kid that's in front of you and say, is this working
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:08.940]   for them? Because we are not teaching curriculum. We're teaching children. And I say that as an avid CC
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.720]   mom and an avid, whatever homeschool mom, but we are teaching those little souls, those little
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.660]   immortal souls that sit in front of us every day, that's who we're teaching. And I have had many years
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:26.600]   where I start off earnestly in August with a plan and a curriculum and blah, blah, blah. And then by
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:33.860]   November we're, we're changing it all up. So, um, you know, I think curriculum is, is long and deep and
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:41.600]   wide and we could get there, but just on the, on the front end of it, I would say that developing your
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.620]   philosophy of homeschool, why you're doing it and you know, what, what, um, outcome you want from even
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:53.740]   just the first few months or the year or whatever, that's where you have to start. I agree. I agree.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.500]   And if you're listening to this podcast and you're looking for a great place to begin,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.800]   the scribblers at home curriculum actually takes you through the steps to create and craft a vision
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.380]   statement for your family so that you can think more deeply about your why, because I'm going to tell
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.780]   you right now, friends, that if you don't firmly latch onto that, why it's really easy to make a
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:20.340]   decision to just forego, um, what you've been called to do. And so it is, I agree with you, Lynn,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.760]   it's so important to understand your family's why so that you have a target. You're not shooting an
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.120]   arrow and then drawing a bullseye around it, but you have a target for why, um, you're making the
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.620]   decisions that you are. Um, Dede, I'm curious, you've already alluded to this a little bit, but, um,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:42.860]   there is a lot of preparation for homeschooling that is invisible. And I know the theme of practicum
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:48.600]   this season is seeing the unseen. So I'm curious if you would allude a little bit more about
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.560]   spiritually, how did you prepare for your calling to homeschool? Um, were there steps that you took
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:02.380]   with your husband or individually that you felt prepared you well, um, or at least prepared you?
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.760]   I'll say that because we've all learned things after the fact, um, as well, or beginning homeschooling
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:16.360]   with your family. Yeah, I would say it's abiding in the word. I think it's understanding that no matter
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:23.020]   what you're doing, you are teaching your children. If I'm spending my morning on YouTube, looking for
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.500]   the perfect block schedule for my kids, I'm teaching my kids that you need to go to YouTube and find the
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:36.860]   perfect schedule for yourself. Instead of putting up my Bible, reading the word, letting it wash over me,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.120]   maybe pausing at a verse and saying, Oh, that's interesting. While I'm at the table and my kids are
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.520]   eating breakfast and saying, Oh, that's, that's interesting. And then speaking about it, you know, all of
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:57.380]   those things are teaching our children. So I feel like just abiding in the word and prayer was the most
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:03.920]   important part of preparing me spiritually. I think the Lord gave me this verse in Ephesians 5 16 that says, um,
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:10.320]   something to the effect of redeeming the time for the days are evil. And it sounds kind of like looming,
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.100]   you know, I'm like the days are evil. We will homeschool, you know, it's like
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:24.360]   my vigilante over here, but it was more, it was more about, you know what, let's, let's see what we can
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.980]   do to actually love the Lord and love family and his purpose for us through homeschool. And so I love what
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   you said to Lynn about the, why is so important. If you have that, why, if you care, the curriculum
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:43.860]   will follow all those things will happen. And even when you're not bound to the curriculum,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.340]   right. When you're just sitting in between subjects or it's lunchtime, what you do with yourself,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:55.500]   that's still teaching your kids is important. So if you have a worship song, you want to play that
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:04.240]   matters. Um, so I just, I think in preparation, it was, I just had that verse, um, kind of ready
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.200]   on my heart and ready to share. And then just continuing to look for ways to be with my kids
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.560]   and see where they are spiritually as well. So I feel like to start, you just have to be with your kids.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.820]   You, you have to sit with your kids. It's the time that you invest in them. And I had a friend
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.880]   who had homeschooled many years before me. And she said, it's not about choosing the right curriculum
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.020]   or finding the right books. Like you were saying, Kelly, it's not a silver bullet. It's that you use
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:38.280]   the books you have. And that really struck me because I was always searching, always looking for the next
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.820]   great curriculum that was shiny with the stickers. And you go to all these fairs and you're like,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:49.400]   no, that one is better. Just use the things you have, use the tool you have. We have the Lord,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.880]   we have our children, we have our husband, right? Supporting us. So when you use that,
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.640]   I feel like you do feel more equipped to do the tasks that you're called to do.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.740]   Yeah. When I started, I, I'm just thinking about what you said, Didi. I don't think I really
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:11.660]   understood God's word and the truth of Christianity. I don't know if I really understood how important
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:17.580]   that was in our homeschool. I feel like the last two to three years as my older ones are getting older
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:23.580]   and like, you can start to see them, you know, as adults in the real world, which is like a whole
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:31.140]   other thing. But I'm like, there's only one thing that matters. Like, it's really true. Like all of those
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.800]   mamas, you know, who were old when I was young and they would say, it's really the only thing that
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:44.080]   matters. I don't know if I had ears to hear that at the time, but man, I do now. And I just, if there's
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:51.240]   anything that I could say today, it would be that, you know, that the truth of Christianity, that God's
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:58.600]   word is actually the most important foundation for these kids. Yeah. You know, what's amazing about
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:05.720]   that is that they see us growing as well, right? They can look back and say, I remember when mom was
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:14.380]   so into this one curriculum and so on edge about this and our test scores. And then, you know, it just
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:20.460]   became about really good conversation about who God is and they feel the difference in their bodies and
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:25.740]   they take that with them. And so it is an all around school. Like we're all becoming educated. We're all
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:31.580]   growing and that's the fruit of homeschooling and in community because your testimony, what you're
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:39.140]   sharing encourages me that it's still happening wherever we are today. Right? Like even now there's,
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.660]   there's something, there's a place God is still taking us and taking these families that are listening.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.500]   They might not know exactly where, but that's okay. You'll get there.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:54.060]   Absolutely. Absolutely. I think we've already alluded to this a little bit and the fact that
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:00.860]   God's word sustains us, um, that as believers, we homeschool because that is the main thing
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:07.300]   and keeping the main thing can be difficult and sometimes overwhelming, um, even discouraging.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:12.640]   So I'm curious, you know, a lot of the people who are listening to this, this conversation might
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.740]   think like, Oh, there are going to be so many mountaintop moments as homeschoolers. And there
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:23.840]   are, but there are also some valleys that we experienced. And I'm curious, um, if both of you
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.820]   would speak to that a little bit, have there been moments where perhaps you were discouraged because
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:34.340]   you were doing the right things and you were doing them well, but you got weary, or there was something
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:41.400]   that maybe was a setback for you during those times. Um, and maybe both can allude as much as
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.200]   you're comfortable with, um, how did your faith sustain you? How did your walk with the Lord sustain
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:54.800]   you through those times? Um, and Lynn, you can go ahead and lead off with that. Um, yeah, I mean,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:01.940]   the answer is yes. Discouragement is like, it's just part of the, part of the plan. And so, yeah,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:07.680]   I mean, there's been health things, business, uh, disappointments, there's been, um, financial
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.980]   strain. Um, there was a brief period where I sent my kids to a private Christian school
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:19.760]   because I was burnt out, burnt out, burn out is a real thing. Um, all of the things, all
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.200]   of the things, um, and you ask, you know, how did my faith sustain me? I don't know if I could
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.940]   tell you how it sustained me. I just know that it did. And that, um, I was thinking about
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:37.240]   like, I was thinking about that whole concept where we're putting God in the center of, of
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:44.660]   all of the education. Right. And so my faith is, it's not an ingredient in how to make a great
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:52.260]   homeschool cake. It's like, it's like the house where you're making the cake. It's like the world,
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:59.120]   like it's so much bigger than an ingredient. And I think when I first started, I thought that faith
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.600]   was an ingredient. I thought that the Bible reading the Bible of my kid was a box to check or something,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.280]   which don't get me wrong. Sometimes it is. They got to check a box. Okay, fine.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:15.220]   But that's because we're building the discipline. But now looking back to those early years is like
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:22.580]   faith was everything. It was everything. Um, and, um, I think, I, I don't know if we could put a little
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:28.020]   bit of a finer point on the idea that faith isn't necessarily the curriculum that we're teaching our
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:34.240]   kids, but it is that overarching thing. Um, because I know if I were listening to this and I was a mom,
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:40.240]   like, Oh, I want to homeschool those little old ladies who sit and they say, it's all about Jesus,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:48.500]   this is my heart, you know, well, it is, but it, it, it also is about like, well, what the heck do I do?
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:55.600]   You know? Um, uh, we can speak to that, but I know that, right. You know, for this, um, what's germane
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:02.440]   to this point is that faith is really everything. It really is. I love the idea of, you know, it being
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:09.640]   the house, like it is, it is, it is where and how we do what we do. What about you, Dede?
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.900]   So, yeah, I will echo what Lynn said. Yes. The times of discouragement are there and they're still
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:23.420]   here. Um, and how did my faith sustain me again, similar to Lynn? I, I don't really know how,
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:30.320]   I don't even know that I knew it was happening when it was. It's just the fact that I, I got through
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:36.820]   another day. Yes. And I, I wasn't going to bed like, wow, my faith really got me through today.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:43.860]   It was like, it was like, Oh my goodness. Are we ever going to make it? And then you turn around
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:49.740]   and you're like, Oh wow, this actually, these things were okay. Like the gaps that I thought were so big
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:56.960]   and so wide and that I thought I needed to fill. God was filling that God was doing that. And you look
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.820]   around and you have people that have also poured into your kids because of community homeschooling
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:07.380]   and community. I can't say that enough. God designed us for community. And so that's where
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:13.640]   I feel like my faith, I was carried because other people saw the fruit that my kids were bearing and would
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.600]   say, Hey, your son did a good job with this. Or your daughter, you know, really stepped up in this
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.540]   way. And I was like, Oh, they did. Okay. So, so it's okay. And I think those are the moments that
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:31.360]   really encouraged me to keep going because you really can't fill all the gaps. You just can't,
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.700]   it's impossible, but it's a reminder to rely on God even more because that it is the house. It's where
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.480]   we live. That's right. That's right. I love that. I love that. I'll carry that metaphor with me
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.880]   throughout the rest of the day. Absolutely. Um, you know, I look back on the beginning of our
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:56.340]   family's homeschool journey and I think about the person I was, um, at that place that although I had
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:04.560]   a formal education to be an educator, um, there were ways that I still felt woefully inept, um,
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:12.000]   because I was used to educating solo in a classroom, um, by 25 little people who were all
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.440]   the same ages. And, you know, at the end of the day, guess what guys, they went home and then I would
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:25.220]   go home and then I could breathe and relax. And so, you know, coming into homeschooling and realizing
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:30.920]   that, you know, they're with me all the time and they're not, they're not going away.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:41.140]   But also a mega adjustment for me. So when, when we began homeschooling, um, I was grateful
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:47.480]   for the blessing of community because, um, you know, there were other individuals who could speak
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:53.400]   truth into my life, who can maybe keep an eye on my children for five minutes so that I could have a
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:59.240]   conversation with a friend or go to the bathroom. That's right. Most importantly, go to the bathroom,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:06.280]   get a snack, breathe, talk in complete sentences, all those things. Um, I am curious when you guys
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.980]   first began, um, and I already know the answer to this because one thing that I have not told you
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:16.140]   listeners is that both of these dear ladies are my friends, my personal friends and directors in the
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:22.560]   community in which I participate. So we know each other pretty well. Um, initially when you started this
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.100]   process, did you guys seek out a homeschooling community, recognizing that you needed that
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:34.880]   support? And I'm curious how the supportive community continues to shape your journey as
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.080]   homeschoolers now, because you've both already said you have younger children, but you also have older
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:45.680]   children. And I know for me personally, we're at the end. It makes me teary. We're at the end of our
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.940]   homeschooling journey as a family, at least with our three children that God has given to us. Now
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.640]   there may be opportunities to homeschool grandchildren down the line. So we'll cross that bridge when we
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:04.180]   come to it. But, um, you know, I'm curious, like how has community shaped your journey? Um, Dede,
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.800]   when you first came into homeschooling, did you immediately navigate toward a community or did you
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:16.000]   try to go it alone or how did that work out for you? I'm curious. Well, I initially started in the
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.820]   summertime with our, um, you know, just the books that we were reading. So we started with the boxcar
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.980]   children and the curriculum I used said, here's how you can pull out a science lesson from that.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:31.280]   But I will speak to the idea of community can just be one person. Community can be that neighbor friend
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:37.420]   that I had said, you can do this because I had relationship with her already. And so community
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.760]   doesn't have to be this big group of people that maybe you don't really know. It can be that one
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.300]   person who has walked alongside you and says, I know you, I know your kids. I see what you're doing.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:54.520]   You can do this. And it also helped being able to just watch her homeschool and step into her room
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.180]   every once in a while and say, Oh, you guys are doing math. Here's what it looks like. I wasn't
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:05.940]   necessarily seeking out community. Let's say it just kind of found me. And I think, again, that's the Lord
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:11.420]   leading me to this because I didn't even know what, you know, like whoever's listening. This is great
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:19.040]   that you're listening to this. I just, you know, I was like, Oh, okay. You can do this or that. And
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   they just, I feel like it just found me. And then ultimately classical conversations was that broader
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:31.900]   community. But even within the broader community, I found relationship like with you guys. And when I was
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:38.600]   weary and I was low, I could just reach out and say, okay, how do we do this? Or how are you doing?
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:45.520]   And then encourage each other. And I think it's also interesting to how God will allow someone to
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.860]   come across your path that also has a need. So when we're feeling depleted and low, there's someone that
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:56.300]   needs advice or a word. And you're like, you know what, you could do this, this, this. And suddenly you're
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:02.780]   not so low, right? Like it's just the way that we can see others as well that have needs. We all have
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.540]   needs. So I don't know if that answers your question, but yeah.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:13.420]   It does. What about you, Lynn? Were you naturally drawn to community at first or did you start this
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:18.540]   alone? I'm just curious because we're all three in community together now. And I know we've had
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.860]   conversations about community and the value of it. So I'm curious what your experience was.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:30.460]   Yeah. I can remember when my oldest was four, four months, four months old. My, um, I think it was
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:35.720]   through a sermon I heard or something. I was like, I'm starting a mom's group. So we had a mom's group
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:42.260]   from the time she was four months old. And that really informed my sort of like collection of knowledge
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:48.300]   about community. Um, it was not homeschool. It was just getting through that first year of life.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.960]   A lot of talking about birth stories. That's part of that first year of life is processing through
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:50:01.000]   that, which is wonderful. Um, and then, um, so community to answer the question first and foremost
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.920]   is always been a part of my motherhood journey. Um, and then, so when my friend Emily said, well,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.220]   we're up here, she, she lives in a different state, but we're doing CC. And I was like, Oh,
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:19.800]   I'll just do that. Um, it was, I think as I look back on natural outcropping of what I had already
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:25.180]   been doing that, obviously I'm going to need to meet with some ladies once a week. Like that's just
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:31.880]   part of my rhythm and routine. Um, I will say that we did CC for five years, the first five,
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.260]   and then we moved and, um, we didn't move far, but we moved far enough that I couldn't continue
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:46.840]   attending that community. And where we moved to, uh, there was no space for, they had four or five
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:53.860]   communities and they were chock full. And so I could not be a part of community. And so then it
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:51:00.320]   got taken away from me. And then I realized like, it was like oxygen. I was like, this is really
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:06.760]   difficult to do this without community. And I will say just the way that timeline works there, um,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:13.720]   that not being in community for me led me to, um, that fall where I, I did send my kids to Christian
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:20.380]   school, which is, it's totally fine. I understand, but I just know that, um, the burnout of having no
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:27.960]   one around feeling alone, I'm in a new town. Um, it was enough to, to kind of, to get me really low.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:35.640]   So, um, you know, after the, the Christian school stuff, it was COVID. So then it was like, well,
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:42.240]   obviously nobody's in community right now. I mean, family became community, family was community.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:50.260]   Um, and so when the opportunity arose in 2021 for us to be a part of a community, I jumped on it all
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:57.900]   10 toes, like let's go. Um, because I knew that that would, would be life sustaining. And then moving
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:04.060]   to North Carolina again, I was like the first calls that I made when I knew we were coming here were to
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:10.380]   find a community. Absolutely. Absolutely. I would say if you are a parent who is standing on the edge,
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:16.320]   the precipice of homeschooling and you're thinking, you know, what are, what are the first steps that I
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:21.600]   need to take? I think that both of these ladies have, have alluded to the fact that you need to be in
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:30.260]   relationship, um, with either with your community of one, as Didi said, so, so lovely. We all begin with
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:37.020]   a community of one. There's one person perhaps who shares with you or encourages you, but then also
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:43.440]   getting to a place where you recognize the need to come into community and be surrounded by others who
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:49.260]   perhaps have the same mission or have the same goals. I would strongly encourage you to seek out
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:56.460]   a practicum near you this summer. Um, you know, I know that practicum is a great time where you can
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:01.600]   get together and you can sit across the table and have conversations with others who are contemplating
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.960]   the same things and where you can feel a camaraderie. Um, just like I feel with both of these wonderful
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.860]   friends. Um, just knowing that you can have conversations about these things, what God's calling
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:19.900]   you to what this looks like when it's fleshed out in your own home. So definitely go to classical
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:27.780]   conversations.com and do a search on the events tab that's on that page and see if you can locate a
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:33.940]   local practicum to attend so that you can begin to taste the first fruits of community, um, with others
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:39.580]   who are similarly called. So as we start to wind down this podcast, um, we could, we could probably
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:45.900]   record two or three hours, just a conversation together. Um, and you know, we are, we, we have
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.660]   talked about several things. We've talked about the importance of being connected, um, you know,
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:58.980]   spiritually to the one capital O who has called us to this, the importance of being connected to
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:05.500]   community, the importance of preparing yourself physically, mentally, spiritually, for what God has
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:11.740]   called you to. And I'm curious, um, both of you, um, I know personally have a rebellious streak.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:19.340]   So I would love to, um, as we wind down this podcast, talk about what does being ready for
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:27.480]   homeschooling really mean? And I say being ready in air quotes and what are myths about readiness now that
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:34.580]   you're farther down this journey that you'd like to debunk. Um, and I'm going to lead off by saying
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:44.840]   that you will never be feel a hundred percent percent ready. And that is God's gift in your life.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:53.680]   Um, because I think looking back, if I had felt 100% ready, what need did I have for God to sustain me
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:03.120]   daily? Um, don't negate his work, your reliance on him by feeling like you are self-sustaining and that
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:08.280]   you're self-sufficient and have all of the answers because homeschooling, what you will quickly
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:14.380]   discover is a walk of refinement. You begin thinking it's a refining for your children,
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:20.460]   but then somewhere along the way, you also discover that it's a refining for you as you redeem your own
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:28.320]   education academically and spiritually. So I'm curious, Didi, is there a myth you'd like to debunk
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:37.820]   about readiness? Wow. Um, I guess it sounds so simple. I almost want to say it. You just,
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:45.980]   you just have to care. You just have to, it's a heart decision, honestly. Like I know I've said that
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   before, but if you care about your kids, the fact that you're listening to this, whoever's listening to
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:56:00.140]   this, you're ready because you want to know more. You want to understand that's what it takes. Cause
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:05.800]   that will continue to lead you to the right curriculum and the right community and all those
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:11.760]   things because you care about how your kids are being educated. So I feel like maybe the myth I'd
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:19.280]   like to debunk is that you have to have everything set up beforehand. Um, that is a myth. You do learn as
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:24.380]   you go as with everything. I mean, if you were to take an archery class, you don't have to know how
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:30.760]   to do it before you start, you show up. So you just show up with your kids, you show up with your heart
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:38.340]   in the right place with the Lord and you will homeschool your kids. So I love that. I love that.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:45.560]   All right. Then another myth to debunk. Yeah. I mean, I can't echo enough. You'll never be ready.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:52.600]   You'll never be enough. It's all, all the things like, um, but I think that there is value in saying,
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:59.320]   um, that, you know, when, when the babies were little, right. They would be like in, in some new
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:04.060]   stage. Right. And I would be like, Oh, well, she usually takes a nap between dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:09.680]   Or she usually really likes this food or whatever. And I figured out so quickly that we just aren't
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.540]   going to do that anymore. We're just not going to say what she usually does because that'll be the day
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:20.160]   where she doesn't. And, and if I have some preconceived notion about what she's supposed to
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:26.960]   do or usually. So, I mean, roll that into homeschooling your kids. It's just like what you might think
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.980]   it's going to happen. It won't what you think your schedule is going to be. It won't. And so that idea
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:37.880]   of just like holding your hands open to what the Lord wants to do. And I agree with you. You can't be
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:42.620]   a hundred percent ready. I don't even know I'm going to be 50% ready, you know? Um, cause you
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:49.460]   really do just need that space for flex for, you know, that kind of thing. And one thing, I don't
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.300]   know if this is a good place to say it, but I think I misunderstood timing. I think I misunderstood
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:58:02.540]   with a kindergarten student that, um, how much time would be like the school part. Um, and I think I
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:07.940]   had preconceived notions that it was hours and hours because that's what my idea of school would
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:13.120]   be. I, I send them away. Well in California, not for kindergarten, but first grade it's all day. And
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.460]   you know, that I, I feel like that's one of the things I tell people. It's like,
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:22.040]   you spend 45 minutes with your kindergartner, like that's it. And they're like, wait, what,
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:28.600]   you know? And, and I was that same way. And so, you know, are you ready to do 45 minutes a day with
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:34.560]   your kindergartner? I mean, that's a lot less of a commitment than six hours of school, you know?
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:40.040]   And, and by the way, if you do try to do two, three, four, five, six hours with your first grader,
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:47.880]   everyone's going to cry. Everyone. Um, so just, yeah, it's really the pressure there. When you
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.160]   talk about the, having grace with yourself, like that's, that was a great thing to learn is like,
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:58.120]   it's real easy to check the school box. If it's 45 minutes, when you start, when they're little.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:06.260]   Absolutely. Absolutely. Wise advice. I want to thank both of you for joining me today. And as we get
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:11.440]   ready to say our goodbyes to you, listener, um, I have one more question for both Lynn
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:18.180]   and for Didi. I'm curious. And we've, we've already talked a little bit about if we had a time machine
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:24.080]   to go back in time and talk to that version of ourselves who was in the place. Some of our listeners
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:30.860]   are contemplating this decision. If you can, if you can get in a time machine and go back and tell
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:39.580]   yourself one thing now with your years of experience, what's the one thing you would tell your considering
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:48.140]   homeschooling self? Yeah. I would repeat what my neighbor said. Just try it. Hmm. It doesn't have
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:55.100]   to be permanent. Just try it. And that was the biggest gift. So that's what I would say.
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.940]   So good. What about you, Lynn? What would you tell yourself?
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:07.420]   I would tell myself that having them home with me is more valuable than, um, any other thing that I
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.460]   could be doing with them, like sending them to school or sending them to preschool or whatever it is,
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:21.180]   just having them home and doing no school is even more valuable. Um, that time together,
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:27.860]   when Didi talked about reclaiming her family time and stuff, uh, that just is, it's very true. Um,
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:34.820]   that the first step into homeschool is just gathering your kids and having them close to you. Yeah.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.940]   Thank you both for joining me today for the everyday educator and listener. We want to thank you as well
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:48.060]   for joining us. And if you're still wondering whether you are ready, ready to homeschool,
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:56.540]   God does not always call the equipped. He equips those he, he has called. And we've already spoken
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:03.360]   about this at length today, but remember readiness is not about having it all figured out. It's just not
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.300]   because I will say as a 20 year homeschooler, veteran of homeschooling, I still don't have it
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:15.380]   all figured out, but I do rely on him for the grace that I need. It's about willing, being willing to
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:21.540]   trust, learn and grow every day alongside your children. So Didi and Lynn, I'm going to thank
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.820]   you both for sharing your heart with our listeners today. And we hope today's conversation gave you some
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:32.740]   encouragement, practical insight, and a reminder that you, my friend are not alone in this journey.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:38.400]   So if this episode was a blessing to you, would you take a moment to share it with a friend who might
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.880]   also need some encouragement along their homeschooling journey until next time, keep learning, keep
