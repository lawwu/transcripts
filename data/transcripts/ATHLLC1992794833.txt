[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.220]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.600]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.840]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here today because we're
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.920]   going to do something different.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.440]   Last month, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by my friend, Mesh Lakhani,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.280]   who turned that interview into an episode of his amazing podcast, Founder Stories.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000]   As I listened to it, I realized I hadn't had a chance to share my
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.600]   journey on All The Hacks yet.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.340]   So since he and the team at Lola Media did such an amazing job with that show, I
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.280]   wanted to air the whole story here.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.200]   In many ways, my personal story is really the story of All The Hacks.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.060]   So if you're curious about my background, where the love for travel and deals came
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.800]   from, and how this show came to be, you'll really enjoy this episode.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.280]   And please shoot me an email or a DM to let me know what you think, because this
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.160]   is something new for me and the show.

[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.280]   all know that Amy and I welcomed our second daughter into the world this week.

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.600]   us. But I just wanted to share the news with all of you before jumping into the
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.280]   interview. So without further ado, please enjoy this episode of All The Hacks and
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.240]   Founder Stories.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.000]   A founder's journey has its highs and lows.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640]   It's not a linear path.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.920]   Every founder is also a regular person filled with high hopes and big dreams.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   That middle part of their story, before they reach the top, is where we can catch
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.800]   them at their fullest potential.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   What we learn of their past gives us a glimpse into their future.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.960]   This is Founder Stories.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.680]   Our founder today may sound familiar to those of you who listen to his podcast.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Chris Hutchins is a money optimizer who has spent a lifetime building products.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.280]   He inspired his friends and family by traveling the world on a shoestring
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.440]   budget. He never thought his tricks for getting the most bang for his buck would
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.800]   lead him to be a popular podcast host.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.840]   His goal? Make your money go farther than you thought possible.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   This is the story of All The Hacks.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins. I love building products.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.760]   I host a podcast about optimizing your life called All The Hacks.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.320]   Technically, I grew up in St.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.920]   Louis, but we moved by the time I was four.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.200]   So my memories are just really the pictures and the videos that I saw as a child.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.960]   So my life growing up really was, you know, kind of outside of D.C.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.120]   in the suburbs. It was kind of like your typical suburban American childhood.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480]   You know, I went to school on a yellow school bus.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.560]   We had a playground in the backyard.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.880]   It's been good life to the best.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.520]   I knew it. My parents, because they worked at home, they had computers at home and
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.320]   not everyone had computers at home in the late 80s, early 90s.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.200]   But my parents did. And boy, like as soon as my dad got a second computer,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.440]   the old computer went downstairs and I was I was down the rabbit hole.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.680]   Yeah, dad, 28.8 modems are out.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640]   Can we please upgrade? Can we please upgrade?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.560]   Dialing into BBS's, goofing off on Prodigy, then AOL.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   Yeah, I remember when we first got an ISDN line, it was like, you know, 128k.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   I was like, wow, we're speeding along the Internet now.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   And I made weird presentations for school where I would project a PowerPoint
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.400]   onto a TV and like record it on video and make like video presentations.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.800]   So I was definitely a nerd.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.840]   And then I also loved punk rock music, hardcore shows, skateboarding, BMX.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.360]   My friend down the street and I would make skate videos all the time
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.480]   where we'd like clip ourselves and then like we put other pros from other videos
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.240]   and it'd be like pro doing something awesome, us doing something just like not
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.160]   awesome, but we felt really cool about it.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.840]   I always ask my parents, I was like, was I an entrepreneur from a kid?
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   And they tell me some stories that, you know, I maybe forgot.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.040]   And then there's definitely stories I remember.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.080]   So I remember I really wanted to go to concerts for free.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.760]   I've kind of always been an optimizer trying to get the best deals.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   And so I was like, gosh, how do I go to these concerts?
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.200]   Like the Vans Warped Tour.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.560]   Like I was like, I want to go to this, but I want to pay for it.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   So I remember making like a magazine, like a seven page magazine about punk rock.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.960]   And I would like bring a copy to some local concert or a promoter and be like,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.200]   Hey, I've got this magazine.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.800]   Can I get into the show for free?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   And so I was always trying to creatively find ways to achieve outcomes that maybe
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.160]   weren't businesses per se, but that there was that entrepreneurial spirit in there.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.280]   But it never crossed my mind that this could be something I would
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.720]   ever do professionally.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.480]   It was just like a huge passion of mine.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.040]   When I was in middle school, I had the luxury of my parents being home all the
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.760]   time, but I also had the challenge that they were working all the time.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.520]   And so a lot of my friends maybe had one parent that didn't work or a parent that
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.800]   came home and were done with work at 5pm.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.360]   But my parents owned companies and they were really busy.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.040]   And so I was like, I want to go to boarding school.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.120]   And I begged my parents to send me to boarding school for high school because I
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.280]   wanted the freedom to kind of go anywhere.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.320]   I was like, I can take the bus.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.440]   I can take the Metro.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.920]   I can go do whatever I want.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.800]   I could get to my friends because they live on the campus.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.760]   I loved going to boarding school.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.720]   Every time I asked them, they're like, what did you do wrong?
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.120]   And I'm like, no, no, it was amazing.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.280]   The high school I went to, and this was in early 2000s, I think I started in 1999.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.200]   Every kid had a laptop and everything was online.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   You were like, if a teacher emailed you an assignment and you didn't get that
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.600]   email, like you're failing the assignment.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.560]   That was kind of new at that age for a school to do that.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.000]   And it was super old school.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.680]   Like all the computers still needed ethernet.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.960]   So every single desk and every single classroom had an ethernet plug and you
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.280]   had to like plug your laptop in and you had to charge it because the battery
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.120]   only lasted like 45 minutes.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.360]   We actually had a class where you could become a Microsoft certified network
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.640]   administrator that took that class.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.920]   And we had a network.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.080]   And I remember in high school, we wanted to like share games and
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.600]   movies that we'd all downloaded.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   And so we created like a network that you could log into.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.560]   That was our network, right?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.360]   Like there was the school network you could log into.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.400]   And then me and these three, four guys created our own network that you could
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.840]   log into and share stuff.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.000]   In high school, this friend of mine sent me this email and was like, "Hey, I met
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.560]   these guys that are selling dial-up internet service.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.960]   You can sell it for them and make a lot of money.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.000]   Do you want to learn about it?"
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.600]   Sure.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.520]   So I go to this meeting and they're pitching this thing that they're like,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.880]   "Yeah, we sell dial-up internet service."
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.920]   But like, that's not the cool thing.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.200]   The more reps you sign up under you to sell dial-up internet service,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.240]   the more money you make.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.520]   This is a total pyramid scheme.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.680]   So instead of walking away, I was like, "Gosh, what should I do?"
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.840]   I like called up Fox 5 in DC and was like, "I need to talk to the
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.360]   investigative reports team.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   I've got something for you."
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.160]   And we ended up bringing a, like an undercover camera.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.920]   I had like a camera on a button on my shirt and we hid another camera in a room.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.200]   And I had a fake brother or cousin.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   I can't remember who I was.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.800]   I emailed them.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.400]   I was like, "Hey, I don't know how I feel about the pitch, but my brother's obsessed.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.760]   You guys got to come talk to him."
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.360]   And we did like an undercover sting operation where we exposed the pyramid
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.160]   scheme and all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.040]   And ultimately, that company never existed.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.400]   I guess a theme in my life was if something can't be done, let's just try it anyways.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   Boarding school had really prepared me to not have to deal with all of the stress
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.840]   that comes from living away for the first time when you go to college,
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.080]   figuring out what that's like.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.720]   And so when I got to college, I was like, "Let's do all the things."
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.120]   And so I remember a lot of the kids I went to high school with were always
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.240]   posting online and this is like early days of Facebook where like the only
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.640]   thing you do is post what you're doing.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.680]   And so people were like, "Oh, I'm at this concert."
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.240]   And I was like, "How are you going to this concert?"
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.760]   They're like, "Oh, our school put on a concert."
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.640]   And I was like, "What do you mean your school?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.000]   My school doesn't put on concerts.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   And if we do, there's certainly nothing anyone wants to go to
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.960]   or they're not that exciting."
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.160]   So I was like, "Hmm, I wonder how you can do that."
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   And I was in student body government at the time.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.560]   I was like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.960]   Anyone can rent the stadium, like the basketball stadium at school.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.920]   Anyone could get permits to reserve the parking lots."
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.760]   So I was like, "Oh, what if I just put on a concert?"
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.560]   I talked to a friend of mine who was like way more into music than I was,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.040]   at least more mainstream music.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.560]   "Dude, what's the band that we should do a concert for?"
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.920]   And he's like, "I got this band and they're going to be huge.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.800]   They're called The Fray."
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.400]   I have no idea what that means.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.720]   And he's like, "They're really good.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.440]   I'm going to go on a limb and trust you because I have no idea what this band is."
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   But thanks to my trusty friend, Kevin, that we booked The Fray.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   And then we went to the school and we're like, "We need to rent the stadium.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.520]   Can you guys sell tickets for us?"
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   So we ended up selling tickets.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.680]   We ended up putting on this concert, but we didn't hire a production company.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.440]   We did for lights and sound, but not for making the whole event work.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   VIP backstage passes were things that I printed on my printer in my room.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.760]   And I bought a laminator to laminate them.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.360]   And when we had to make a green room, we literally took couches from our apartment.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.080]   We went to Walmart to buy the stuff people asked for in their riders.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.520]   It was the most amateur experience you could imagine, but it all went off.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.440]   And I think we probably made like five grand, which in college was the most
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.560]   amazing amount of money ever split between three or four people.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.000]   And it's a theme in my life that I guess sometimes gets you into trouble, but
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.120]   oftentimes leads to exciting things.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.120]   I've asked in almost every company I've worked at, "Let's go meet with the CEO.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.920]   Let's go meet with the person running this team."
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.600]   And I've been told sometimes, "Oh, you can't do that."
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.280]   I'm like, "Why not?
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.080]   I'm just going to try."
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   So in college, I was like, "I'm just going to go schedule a meeting with
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.880]   the Dean of the business school."
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.600]   And I didn't know until later that he's on a bunch of boards, knows a lot of
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.560]   companies, the deans of colleges and the people who run the school,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.400]   they're pretty connected.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.240]   So I was just like, "Well, I'm going to go meet with them."
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.880]   It wasn't a thing that most people were doing, but it turned out to be the only
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.920]   reason I got a job after I graduated.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   That might be actually one of the best college indirect advice I've ever heard.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.880]   Try to make a relationship with the Dean, introduce yourself when you get there.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.040]   That is the first, I'm 37 years old.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.200]   That's the first time I'm like, "Oh, that would have been actually smart.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.120]   I should have done that."
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   I never really knew what I was going to do after college.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.520]   You know, what ultimately happened was I went home over Thanksgiving and I
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.280]   connected with a bunch of friends that I went to middle school and high school
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.000]   with, and they all had jobs.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.680]   And I was like, "What do you mean you have a job?"
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.200]   And they're like, "This is when all the companies hire.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.400]   Like, if you want a job at top companies, it's gone."
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.040]   And so I went back to school after Thanksgiving, before Christmas, and I
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.680]   went to the Dean and I said, "Hey, I need a job in management consulting or
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.480]   investment banking.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.160]   Can you help me?"
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.920]   He came back.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.800]   He said, "I know a guy who works at one management consulting firm and I sit on
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.720]   the board of this company.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.520]   And there's another guy on the board that works at an investment bank."
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   He's like, "I'm going to introduce you to two of them."
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.040]   Sure enough, I hear from the management consulting firm, "Yeah.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.800]   You missed the boat.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.480]   The cycle to get a job after graduation is over.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.280]   But if you want to interview, you can interview for the next cycle."
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   And I was like, "Great.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.360]   Let's do it.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.000]   Bring me in."
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.480]   So I came in, I interviewed there.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.560]   And then the investment bank said, "We don't hire people out of college, but we
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.240]   have an internship that you could do.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.840]   And if it works out, maybe it turns into a job, but probably not."
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.880]   Fortunately, at the end of the internship, they offered me to stay on.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.400]   But it wasn't stay on, you're now on the same ranks as all of the associates.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.720]   It was like stay on as a full-time intern kind of thing.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.960]   But instead of having a class of 20, where I had 19 other people to help out with all
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.240]   the work they wanted the interns to do, it was just me.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.400]   My breaking point was a week where I didn't see my wife awake.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.000]   At the time, girlfriend, I didn't see her awake for five days straight.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.120]   And I went to management consulting.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.960]   I guess I thought it would be a lot different, but it was pretty similar.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.680]   Maybe swapping out Excel for PowerPoint.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.640]   In management consulting, it's all about slides.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.360]   In investment banking, it's all about spreadsheets.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:40.440]   But my experience in management consulting was one where I really understood what an
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.040]   entrepreneurial spirit is and how it can be crushed.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.200]   It's a job that provides you a ton of access to interesting problems and really smart
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.760]   people, but it's not a place in most firms or the firm I was at where if you have an
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.520]   idea that could be really interesting at a more senior level, that you could do that.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.160]   Science has shown that being charitable can actually have a huge impact on your
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.840]   happiness, which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.240]   They're a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give, and they
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   have a mission I think we can all get behind, helping people be more generous more
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.840]   often. Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving because they offer an account that
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.320]   makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.680]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week or
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   month, and all your contributions are tax-deductible, except you don't actually
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.880]   have to know exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.640]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now and invest that money
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.000]   into stocks or even crypto so it can grow tax-free and let you have more impact in
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.960]   the future. Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than one and a
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.320]   half million charities, schools, or faith-based organizations in a matter of
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.080]   seconds. So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:08.120]   today, and for a limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:15.520]   to the charity of your choice. Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.800]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day, and
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.040]   that's thanks to Viore, and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.720]   episode. They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile. Everything is
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.960]   designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all, and it's so
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.800]   freaking comfortable, you will want to wear it all the time. Seriously, I am
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.280]   pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now, unless
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.840]   you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean. And it's not
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.000]   just for men. My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am. My favorite is the Sunday
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.960]   Performance Joggers. I think I have three pairs, and they are probably the most
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   comfortable pants I've ever owned. Their products can be used for just about any
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.440]   activity, whether it's running, training, or yoga. They're also great for lounging,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.280]   running around town, or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out. Honestly, I
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.560]   think Viore is an investment in your happiness, and for all the Hacks
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.000]   listeners, they are offering 20% off your first purchase, as well as free shipping

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.800]   comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet. Then one weekend, I heard
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.320]   about an event called Startup Weekend that a guy named Andrew Hyde started, and
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.840]   everything for the rest of my life changed in like a flash. And that was in
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.400]   October 2007. So despite living in New York City at the time, I knew the
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.240]   financial crisis was happening, but it didn't really hit me until a year later.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.520]   But Startup Weekend was crazy. I drove up to Boston. This event had happened in
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.480]   Boulder. I don't even know how I heard about it. And I drove up to Boston. I
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.240]   didn't even have a place to stay. I was like, "I'll sleep on the couch. It
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.480]   doesn't matter. This sounds cool." And the idea was get together engineers,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.440]   designers, product people, just anyone. And in the weekend, let's start some
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.720]   companies. So I joined this team and we built a product called Desk Happy. And it
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:25.280]   was a Windows app that every some odd number of hours would remind you to
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.800]   stretch or stand up or do anything. It reminds me of like the Apple Watch
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.360]   pause to breathe kind of thing. But back in 2007, and it didn't go anywhere.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.080]   Like 250 people used it. And I'm fairly certain that they were all the
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.200]   friends and family of the people that were in the room. But I realized, "Wow, in
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.720]   48 hours, we built a company that makes a product online that people could
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.560]   buy if it were actually good. And obviously, we didn't spend that much
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.280]   time on it." This is crazy. This is a job. What I'm doing right now, helping build a
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.400]   product is a thing I could do for a living. I was like, "What am I doing with
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.920]   management consulting?" Andrew was like, "Oh, I'm doing another one in San
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.600]   Francisco." I was like, "I'll be there." And while we were there, I ended up
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.680]   meeting some really fascinating people. And I was like, "I gotta do this." I came
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.920]   home and I was like, "Amy, you don't even love living in New York. How would you
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:19.520]   feel about moving to San Francisco?" So Amy, my wife, who is incredible and has
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.240]   supported me through, I don't know, like 10 different jobs and experiences. And we
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.280]   met sophomore year in college.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.680]   Hello, I'm Amy.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.400]   We didn't get married for a while. I think in our minds, it was like, "We just
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.280]   have so much going on. We don't know where we're going to live." We were very
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.800]   practical about it saying like, "Look, we need to make sure that we're living in a
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.840]   place that we both want to live for a long time." She grew up in Colorado. I
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600]   grew up in DC. In New York, we're like, "We don't want to live in New York
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   forever." And San Francisco ultimately ended up being that. She felt like New
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.080]   York wasn't the place for the long term. And the company I worked for only had
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.200]   offices in Chicago, New York, Boston, San Francisco, and LA. We came up with
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.640]   reasons that the other cities didn't work. And she didn't love her job at the
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.600]   time. So we were like, "Great, let's move. And at least I'll be able to keep my
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.000]   job." And then we were like, "Okay, we should probably find an apartment." And
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.680]   then like, a week later, I get this message to come to the office and have a
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.880]   meeting with a person I've never met before, who ultimately laid me off. This
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.160]   was October 2008 by now. It had been a year of startup weekends, trying to
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.640]   figure out how to move, moving out. It didn't all happen in a week. But we were
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.920]   in the middle of the financial crisis. This was a major situation. I was like,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.720]   "Look, I moved to San Francisco to go work in tech. I didn't move here to work
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.320]   in manager consulting forever." So I was ready to leave. We're trying to figure
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.800]   out what to do. I have no job. No one's gonna hire you between Thanksgiving and
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.320]   Christmas. Companies are closed. Also, no one's gonna hire you because the entire
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:49.440]   economy is crashing. It was definitely a blessing in disguise because I ended up
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.880]   getting to find all the crazy cool stuff that ended up following. But I was
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.400]   kind of pissed. It's like, "You just let me go right in the middle of the
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.560]   holidays." And one of the things that I ended up doing was going to South by
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.000]   Southwest. I went to this event at South by Southwest called Bar Camp. The idea
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.600]   was you create this conference and people just make up topics on the fly.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   They were kind of mostly technology-related. People are like
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.920]   creating events, but there's no organizer. Flashback to the days that we put on a
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.880]   concert in college on our own. It was like we put on a conference on your own. You
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.720]   just say when whoever shows up writes on a sticky pad, "This is a topic I could
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.960]   lead a discussion about or teach people about." You create a schedule on the fly
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.400]   of what the day is. And it occurred to me that there are so many people that are
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.120]   unemployed right now and I'm one of them. Options are find a job, start a company,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.640]   start freelancing. And I knew nothing about any of those things. It's like, "What
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.440]   if we just put on an event? Let's call it Laid Off Camp." And next thing you know, I
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.000]   put on an event with the help of a lot of other people, with hundreds of people
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.160]   showing up, with the media from all over the country. Being laid off can feel
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.800]   pretty lonely, sitting at home searching the internet for jobs, worrying about the
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:09.080]   future. It's called Laid Off Camp and it feels a little like camp. It's very find-a-job 2.0, I guess.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.680]   Maybe it's the idea of camp, even if it is for laid-off people. It's taking place
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.420]   at a club in downtown San Francisco, so there's white leather couches and
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.880]   music. It just like really captured the spirit of where the economy was in a way
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.720]   that I never anticipated. And it was totally open-source. So I actually
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.880]   created a website that was a wiki. I said, "If you live in another city and want to
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.080]   do this, here's the email I sent to sponsors. Here's the schedule. Here's how
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.600]   I organized it." And there ended up being 20 of them around the country. And it was
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.040]   very temporal. The economy kind of recovered, people got jobs, and it kind of
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.960]   just withered away. And Laid Off Camp is no more, which is totally fine. But it was
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.520]   an awesome chance to meet lots of people. And it was a huge opportunity to kind of
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.800]   grow in a city that I had only been in for a very short period of time, but very
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   quickly wanted to try to immerse myself in. So after that, you would think the
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.960]   story would most logically be, "I met these companies. I started working for
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.320]   them. And I had all these fun jobs, but it's a little different." So a company
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.240]   said, "Hey, you put this event on. We want to put on an event to engage our users
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.360]   and our clients. Could you help us put on a series of events?" And I was like,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.280]   "Cool." So I worked with this company outright. Another company came to me and
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.400]   said, "Hey, we're trying to do a... I think it was like a Series C fundraise,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.880]   which now it's probably like a Series F." One of their investors said, "Hey, can you
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.920]   put together some financials of what's going on in your business?" And they had
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   no experience doing that. And they were like, "Hey, you used to work at an
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.560]   investment bank. Can you help us?" So I was working with this company called
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.920]   User Voice to put together their financials and their projections in
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.760]   their pitch deck for their fundraising. I didn't love freelance work because it
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.840]   was very much, you don't have the end ownership in the project. But at the
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.480]   time, in the wake of the financial crisis and not knowing where I would
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.560]   work, it was great to have an income. It all comes to an end. However, any
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   freelance gig usually has an ending. And so I was, I guess, unfortunate and
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.280]   fortunate that they were all coming to an end at the same time. So normally, you
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.440]   try to stagger these things out. So if you have 3 clients and you go to 2, you
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.480]   can get a third. Well, I went from 3 to 0 in like a month. But I knew it was
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.640]   coming. And so a month out, I asked my wife, I said, "Hey, if I'm gonna have no
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.600]   job for a month, should we take a trip?" I put a lot of the expenses from laid-off
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.320]   camp on my credit card. I'd become like an optimizer. So I'd signed up for
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.200]   different cards to get signup bonuses. So we had some miles. I was like, "Let's
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.760]   take a trip." And my wife said, "Let's do it." So we bought a map. We put it on
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.720]   the wall. And we bought push pins. And we're like, "Let's put some push pins in
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.600]   the countries that we're excited to visit." There were so many pins. We were
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.360]   like, "How are we ever going to do this?" Cluster them together. We're like, "Oh,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.400]   if we want to go to these 2 countries, that's a 2-week trip. We want to go to
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.160]   these 2 countries, that's a 2-week trip." As I was doing all this research on
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.280]   which countries to go to, I found people that were like, effectively, they quit
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.400]   their job. They did a gap year. They became nomads. They went on these
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.440]   extended trips. And I was like, "That's interesting." And if you look at any
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.480]   trip that you've been on, the main cost of a trip is usually getting there. The
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.880]   flights are the big cost. The lodging would be the second biggest. We realized,
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.320]   "Wow, if we could stay with interesting people around the world, and we could
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.920]   travel slowly, meaning take a bus between 2 countries for $1 instead of a
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.040]   flight for $300, the trip wouldn't actually cost that much more. And we could
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   sublet our apartment." And all of a sudden, we realized, "We're taking a long
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.480]   trip." And so we decided, "Let's quit. Let's take a trip." So we ended up
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:42.400]   flying one way to South Africa. And over the course of 8 months, we trekked up
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.640]   Africa, through the Middle East, and through Southeast Asia and India. We
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.160]   probably spent I think $7,000 each for an 8-month trip around the world. If you
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.600]   do the math and you take $7,000 and you divide it by 8 months... We're talking
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.080]   about $30 a day. So that's food, that's activities, that's transportation. So we
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:09.240]   were finding crazy ways to take a 52-hour train ride from Zambia to Tanzania.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.760]   I've always been a person that's looking for the best deal. And I try to go back
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   to figure out where that started. My dad definitely played the points and miles
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.480]   game. And we would take trips as a kid in business class using his miles to Europe.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.000]   So I always knew that existed. I was always trying to figure out, "What's a
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.160]   way to get what I want without having to spend money?" And in college, that was
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.920]   opening up credit cards for bonuses, to be able to take trips for free. And on
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.400]   this trip around the world is where it kind of... It was just like a daily
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.640]   occurrence because we had no money. We had money to go on this trip. But if we
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.880]   spent it all, we had to go home early. We knew we had enough miles to get a one-way
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.800]   ticket back home from anywhere in the world. So we knew at some point we would
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.160]   go home. But the more optimal we could be, the longer we could go. And so we were
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.040]   couchsurfing almost the whole trip. We found people on a Lonely Planet forum on
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.360]   the internet who also wanted to travel around Namibia and Botswana. And we
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.800]   rented a car. We bought a used tent and some sleeping bags. And the 4 of us, my
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.200]   still-not-yet wife and girlfriend, and 2 guys from Sweden shared a
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.260]   3-person tent and rented a Toyota Yaris and drove around Southern Africa
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.440]   and a few countries. And so we were always trying to be super optimal. I came
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.920]   back and everyone was like, "How did you do that?" Every person you talk to when you
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.080]   say, "I took 8 months. I went around the world. I saw these amazing things and I
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.440]   spent $7,000." They're like, "I want to do that." After that trip, it was just like my
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.760]   identity. I remember one of the things I did right as we were leaving. Submissions
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.040]   were due to speak at South by Southwest. And I was like, "Gosh, the next step
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.800]   for me is to build a network in a more elevated sense in this tech
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.680]   community." Because I knew whenever I came back, I want to work in tech. I want to
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.000]   work at a startup. So I was like, "Man, if I could speak at South by Southwest, that'd
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.280]   be really cool." So I submitted this talk about what it's like to be unemployed
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.160]   and start things. It was called Fun Employment in the Wake of the Crisis or
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.680]   something like that. So I was in Turkey and we were literally sitting in a
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.400]   guest house carved into the side of the mountains of Cappadocia. But they had
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.680]   internet and I logged on. It was like, "Your talk was approved." And I was like,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.200]   "What? Really?" I thought it was a big long shot. But I was like, "I'm gonna be a
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.360]   speaker at South by Southwest. This is next level." We have 4 or 5 months
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.920]   left, but March is when it ends. And we were like, "The end is Singapore. You
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.320]   get to Singapore." So we were like, "Great. I'm gonna book a flight from Singapore to
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.680]   Austin. And I'm gonna go to South by Southwest straight from the trip." And I
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.720]   now have this new mission, which is I am going to work for whatever I can find to
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.880]   be the hottest startup there is. I want to work for a name brand, amazing
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.440]   startup. That is my mission. South by Southwest is my opportunity to find it.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.840]   All these founders and investors are here. This is what my new life is.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   I was convinced that I found it. I found this company called Simple Geo right
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   after the iPhone 3GS came out. So we all had mobile phones and they had GPS, but
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   nobody really knew what to do with it. And their whole idea was "We're gonna
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.080]   build software that enables developers to use location in their products." I had
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.880]   met casually one of the founders. I wasn't sure how to do this. So I made
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.520]   this presentation that was all about the industry and what's happening and the
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.600]   opportunities. And I had one person I knew well enough who was an investor in
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.280]   the company. I was like, "Can you send this to the founders and let them know? I
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.320]   would love to talk to them." At the time, I thought this is a long shot. I now
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.240]   realized that if a person is that excited to work for you, just hire them.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.800]   So I worked full time at this company in business development. But ultimately,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   the startup didn't work. Around the same time, I had connected with a couple
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.520]   people who had started and worked early at a company called Digg, which was
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.080]   like Reddit before Reddit. They were starting a new company. It was so early.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.640]   This was pre-really starting. And they were like, "Hey, do you want to come
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.760]   join our founding team? And we're going to build this incubator to build
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.520]   products." And I was like, "Gosh. Yeah, of course."
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.880]   By the time I was joining Milk, I felt like I had a good sense of the
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.600]   community and the products and the companies in that aspect. But I had no
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.640]   clue really how to build a consumer product. SimpleGeo was building an API
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.120]   dev product, but they were not building something for consumers. So now it's
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.840]   this whole new world of, "Well, I got to do customer research. I've got to
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.240]   figure out how things work." And so Milk was my chance to learn how to build
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.520]   consumer products. So I came in and I don't even know what my job was at the
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:39.680]   time. I was in charge of HR, payroll, BD, partnerships. I was learning
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.080]   everything. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to give
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.200]   benefits for a company. I don't know how to do any of this, but I was like, "I'm
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.720]   going to learn and I'm going to ask everyone I can for advice." And
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.480]   throughout that experience, I was like, "Wow. I feel like I accelerated my
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.920]   ability to hold my own in the tech community and found a home, at least
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.320]   a... I think I found a home of building products was really cool."
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.800]   But we were trying to figure out how to make the model work. We built a
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.480]   product that was pretty cool. And we were in this crossroads of, "Do we try
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.880]   something new? We're an incubator. Do we double down on the thing we built,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.080]   which we didn't have enough conviction to do? Or do we take all the skills of
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.960]   what we learned and apply them at a bigger company?"
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.440]   We had the opportunity to do that at Google. And so we sold the company to
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.360]   Google. Going through that negotiation, I was frantically trying to make sure
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.000]   all the pieces were in the right place and organizing all the diligence
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.360]   information. And when we landed at Google --and this is so silly-- was that
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.160]   finally, people who didn't work in tech had some sense of what I do.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.600]   Like, "I'm working at this startup that you've never heard of." "Oh, okay."
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.040]   You go to family reunions, people don't believe that you even have a job.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.840]   They're like, "What are you doing?" And now I'm like, "I work at Google."
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.000]   And they're like, "I know Google. I search for things with it." It relates.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.280]   So I go to Google. And through the interview, they're like, "You are a
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.400]   product manager." I didn't know where I would get placed through these
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.640]   interviews. I said, "You're a product manager."
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.000]   So I tried my hand at product. It was a frustrating experience because I was
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.720]   working on Google+, which was a project that, at the time, had about 100 product
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.520]   managers and 1000 total people working on it.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.120]   And my running joke has always been that at any given point in time, there were
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.560]   more people working on Google+ than using it. We were trying to figure out if
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.080]   there was a better place at Google that we could spend our time.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.880]   And I had raised $250,000 for milk from Google Ventures.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   So I went to the team that we raised money from and I said, "Hey, you guys all
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.600]   work at Google. You probably know this org better than we do. We've only been
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.680]   here a few months. Where should we work?"
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.880]   And then they came back and they're like, "Actually, you and Kevin have very
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.240]   distinct skill sets. Kevin's been a very successful seed investor.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.720]   And you're at every event in the mix with everyone. And that's not something
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.480]   we'd really been doing. We'd been really focused on a different style of
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.280]   investing. Why don't you come and do seed investing here?"
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.040]   We moved over to Google Ventures. And for the first time in my life, I had a
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.560]   job that lasted for more than one year.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.760]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.480]   reality is that I am definitely not. So I love having an easy way to get my
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.560]   daily nutritional insurance, which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.240]   Greens. And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.520]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.000]   And I've kept it in my daily routine for months. Every morning, I mix it up
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.320]   with some cold water, add a few ice cubes. It tastes so good when it's cold.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.240]   And I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   feeling I absolutely love. I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.160]   vitamins, minerals, and superfoods, and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.320]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.200]   one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.480]   with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:11.000]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens. Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.240]   to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.480]   insurance. Getting the crew together isn't as easy
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.960]   as it used to be. I get it. Life comes at you fast. But trust me,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.920]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.840]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.520]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.840]   have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.200]   the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.280]   you got through another week. With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.760]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.600]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.320]   leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.160]   across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.840]   were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.760]   delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.280]   local liquor store. So whatever the occasion, download the
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.040]   Drizly app or go to drizly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   today. Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.560]   I just want to thank you, Kwik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.840]   Your support is what keeps this show going. To get

[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.200]   capital, right? I'm about to pick startups and I'm reflecting on my ability to do
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.360]   that, having, you know, joined a startup that
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.280]   didn't work, joined another startup that didn't work but fortunately got acquired.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.760]   Meanwhile, if we rewind to coming back from the trip around the world,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.200]   the talk I gave at South By was with a friend of mine named Matt Van Horn,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.720]   who at the time also worked at Digg. He had a friend that I think was a friend
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.360]   from college or maybe from childhood that was starting this company called
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.320]   Zimride. They basically replaced that message
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.520]   board that we had in college, if you're old enough to remember, where you were
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.920]   like, "Hey, for Thanksgiving, I'm driving here. Does
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.720]   anyone want to get a ride?" And we didn't have some cool app to do
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.080]   it with. And so they were long-distance ride-sharing. It was
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.880]   replacing like going on Craigslist and being like, "Who wants to drive to LA
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.080]   this weekend and split gas?" And for some reason, I was like, "I'm not
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.600]   that interested in this company." But they were also hiring people in
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.880]   sales. And so I told my wife, I was like, "Hey, you should meet this company."
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.080]   And we'd just gotten back from this trip. She didn't have a job. She ended up
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.600]   loving the team and joining as one of the first... I think
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.080]   she was number five on the team at Zimride.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.400]   And the irony in all this is my mission coming back from this trip
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.760]   was to pick the hottest startup in Silicon Valley. And I met the guys at
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.160]   Zimride. I was like, "This is not the hottest startup.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.280]   I'm going for SimpleGeo. SimpleGeo is the one."
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.160]   So for those who don't know, Zimride became Lyft.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.680]   My wife ended up working at Lyft for 10 years, getting arguably
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.840]   an even more advanced and accelerated learning experience than I did
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.760]   watching a company go from 5 people to a public company.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.400]   And then now here I am going into Venture Capital, where my job is to pick
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.160]   which company will be successful. And yeah, I'm working at Google Ventures.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.760]   And I was there for 3 years.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.520]   Boy, it was the most fascinating thing in the world to be able to sit in on
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.440]   these pitches of late-stage companies, hear the questions that smart people
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.800]   that I worked with were asking. And I thought, "Wow, this is finally my
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.600]   opportunity to work at a company for more than one year."
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.360]   This all ties into money in a weird way. I'm still wildly frugal at this
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.120]   point in my life and now as well. But all of that, I think,
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.760]   stems from the fact that I keep having jobs that I never truly knew that I
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.160]   could do forever. One year into Venture Capital, I'm really
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.840]   enjoying it. Maybe I can spend money now because I know that there will be
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.040]   money coming in the future. My worry my whole life was I could never
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   find a thing I love doing. And if I couldn't,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.240]   I didn't want to do something I didn't love, so I wouldn't have money.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.320]   So I was aggressively pursuing financial independence, trying to save every
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.240]   dollar I could because I didn't know that there was a thing I could do that
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   made me happy that generated an income. But 2 or 3 years in, I think, "Gosh,
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.080]   this is fun, but I just don't know if this is for me forever."
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.960]   It wasn't that Venture Capital wasn't fun or it wasn't learning,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.960]   but I think I had this thing inside me that I don't anymore think is true.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.120]   But at the time, I thought, "How can I go invest and help these companies
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   if I've never actually done it myself?" I've never been the CEO of a company.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.400]   I've never seen it through. Inside, I was like, "I can't do this
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.000]   forever. I can't move out of seed and do later stage investing if I haven't
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.120]   been there and done that." A problem that I noticed everyone
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.680]   having and they're coming to me. They know that I'm obsessed with personal
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.320]   finance. So everyone's asking me what to do with money. They're like, "Hey,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.960]   we're getting married. What do we do? Do we combine our finances? Hey,
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.280]   what do we do with our savings? We actually have money. Hey, we're thinking
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.480]   about buying a house. Should we do that? How much house can we afford?"
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.720]   And I'm like, "God, people don't know what to do with their money."
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.280]   And the more I learned, nobody knows what to do with their money.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   So I was trying to figure out what could solve that problem.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.800]   And I heard about this practice that exists called financial planning,
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.920]   which was different from managing your investments. It's about creating this
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.040]   comprehensive plan. And I was like, "Wow, this is interesting. I wonder
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.000]   if that process of going through a financial planning process would solve
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.280]   all these problems these people keep coming to me with about money."
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.720]   Everyone should have a financial plan. Everyone's dressed out with money.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.160]   Everyone should have a financial plan. How do we solve that? And I connected
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.520]   with the friend from middle school, who we built dungeon games on our
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.560]   computers. We'd been talking about this. And every time someone had questions,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.440]   he was my like, "Okay, let me think about that and get back to you."
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.560]   So he decided to move to California.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.440]   He lived in our spare bedroom. And we were like, "Let's start this company.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.840]   If it works, and if we can raise a Series A."
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.560]   He's like, "I'll talk to my wife and we'll move to California.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.800]   But if we can't, I'll just go back."
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.680]   And so ultimately, we left. I told Google Ventures, "I got to work on this more."
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.600]   Thankfully, my wife was now at a much later stage lift,
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.160]   had a much more stable income, and could support effectively going all-in on,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.640]   "Let's do a startup. Let's found it. Let's be the CEO. Let's be the one in charge."
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.760]   Step one, we had to see if the product works. So we just made a product.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.240]   We created a registered investment advisor. We went through the regulatory filings.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.880]   We started helping people to prove that this worked
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.640]   and collecting enough data that ultimately, we were able to raise money.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.720]   And so we pitched investors.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.840]   The way seed investing often worked, at least at the time,
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.760]   was that there were a lot of funds that didn't want to leave.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.120]   So people were like, "I'm kind of interested, but I'll get back to you."
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.800]   And all it took was a lead. And if you didn't have a lead, everything fell apart.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.200]   So we dug in. I remember my co-founder and I sitting at my dining room table
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.800]   where we were working, saying like, "Gosh, if this doesn't work by next week,
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.080]   I think we wrap it up, call it done."
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.360]   And then an hour later, I finally get the call from first round.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.320]   They're like, "We want a lead."
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:14.040]   And so fast forward, a fun process that now that you have a lead and it's a good lead,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.160]   everyone else is like, "Oh yeah, I'm totally in. I know I did. I said I wasn't sure,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.280]   but now I'm in."
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.680]   And so now we were like, "Oh, how do we put this around together? How much is it?
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.640]   How do we fit everyone in?"
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.320]   And we went down a totally different path. Co-founder decided, "Okay, we're going to move
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.560]   out." His wife, he and his wife moved out. They still live out here in Palo Alto.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.600]   He's now working at Stanford. And so we have a round.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.560]   And we're like, "We're off to the race. We got to hire people. We got to get an office."
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   And we scaled up a team. We continued building a product. We launched.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.920]   We had a waitlist that was longer than we could handle.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.120]   But in raw numbers was hundreds of people. And we had proven hundreds of people were
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.400]   willing to pay us. We had a paid waitlist to use our product.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.680]   But when we finally had the capacity to take people off the waitlist,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.400]   they all said, "I'm not ready yet."
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.520]   And we're like, "Oh, do you want your money back?"
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.200]   And they're like, "No, no, no. Keep the $50. I want to do it. I just want to do it right now."
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:09.400]   The lesson we learned brutally over the next year was that everyone wants financial planning,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.040]   but nobody wants to do it right now. To scale customer acquisition beyond that
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.440]   group of 1,000 people that really wanted it now, there was latent demand of people like,
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.120]   "I just want this and at a lower price. It's amazing." We just couldn't scale it.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.040]   $4 million still in the bank. We realized human-powered financial planning
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.000]   is not a product that you can lead with. If you want to do it at scale, it has to be
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.200]   a complementary product to something that has an urgency of using now.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:43.000]   And I was also thinking at the time with my co-founder that maybe we don't need humans.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.640]   Maybe you could implement all this in software. We still would have the problem that if people
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.160]   aren't ready for it now, but we are starting to come to the conclusion that maybe that would be
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.920]   possible. We weren't sure. And around the same time, I had a conversation with Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.440]   who was running Wealthfront. And he said, "Look, we have this vision for self-driving money.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.720]   We want to automate all of the financial planning and everything.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.600]   We'd love people to come help work on that." And we're like, "This is a great opportunity."
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   And I've spent the last 2.5 years working on all kinds of other personal finance products
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.440]   at Wealthfront, trying to ultimately solve the same problem, which is to help people
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.680]   make growing their wealth easier. Meanwhile, while all this is happening,
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.280]   I still haven't convinced myself that I found a job I can work at forever. Because the startup
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.920]   was not working. Now I'm at Wealthfront. And so I still have this thing in my core, which is
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.160]   you still need to keep optimizing to save money. But I still want to do crazy fun stuff.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:47.000]   And so I'm constantly exploring ways to optimize every aspect of my life.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.920]   And that just dominates every conversation I'm having. And it's just become my passion.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.160]   What I spend my time on, on the nights, on the weekends, what I'm sharing with friends,
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.080]   and what I've become known for. I have friends that are now like, "You're my travel agent."
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.160]   And I actually got my travel agent license so that I could be actually a travel agent
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.800]   and book trips for them. The crazy thing that happened is, as we all know, there's the pandemic.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.680]   And in some ways, I think people during the pandemic had more time to sit at home and do
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.480]   things like think about their finances because they weren't out doing other things. And I kept
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.280]   getting all these questions. And I was like, "Man, there's all these people asking me questions."
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.720]   And it's so unscalable to have one-off conversations. Before, it would be like
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.560]   a dinner party with 6 people. It felt a little better. And so Kevin from Milk, my old co-founder,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:37.160]   ended up saying, "You got to start a podcast." And I thought, "Yeah, let's do it."
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.800]   I actually joined him on his show to talk about money hacks. At one point, he said,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.160]   "Hey, tell me about your new podcast." And I was like, "Well, I haven't started it yet."
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.520]   And he's like, "Yeah, yeah. We'll cut this part out. You just need to record an answer
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.440]   to your new podcast and send it to me by Friday." And so I went home and I was like, "Okay. What's
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.400]   this podcast about? What's the theme? What's the trailer? What's the music?" And put it all together.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.520]   And it's just blown past my wildest imagination because it turns out there are a lot of people
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   out there that want to optimize their life. They want to do it while spending less money.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.080]   They want to travel around the world and they want to do it in first class, if possible.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.160]   So what are all the hacks to figure out ways to do that? To save money when you're shopping online
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:21.960]   in the holidays, to invest smarter, to use crypto to your advantage. All of this stuff is stuff we
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:27.720]   cover in the podcast. And now I spend a lot of my time, mostly on my nights and weekends, just
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.480]   digging into all the hacks, talking to the most interesting people I can.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.600]   And that's my avenue for sharing all of these things with the world. We all start a newsletter.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.480]   So if you don't like to listen... Well, I guess if you don't like to listen,
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.160]   I don't know why you're here right now. But we have a newsletter that compliments it pretty well.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.680]   Now, can I turn it into a real business that finally fuels the burning desire to have
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.840]   something sustainable that I love? Maybe. I'm finally feeling like maybe I can start
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   spending a little money. But keep in mind, for me, that's like I can finally order an
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.960]   extra appetizer. Spending a little bit more money for me is not as crazy as it is for some people,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.400]   but I'm working on it. And I did a great episode with Ramit Sethi about this, where he's like,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.160]   "Look, you got to learn how to live your own rich life. Everyone has a different version of it.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.480]   You can find your version and you can create rules that allow you to have a little bit
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.080]   better relationship with money." We talked a lot about my girlfriend, my girlfriend,
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.880]   my girlfriend, right? And the fun story to throw back to our wedding was...
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:27.720]   I remember when we were getting married, I had seen a video from someone I knew,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.320]   but didn't know that well, who had a lot of money's wedding. And they posted online. I was
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.560]   like, "Wow, that was a really impressive video." Like, "Gosh, if you could capture your wedding
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   in that way, it would be wonderful." So at the end of the video, there's a little tag for who
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.480]   made it. I reach out and I'm like, "I would love to do a wedding video." I should have known that
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   when they don't post their prices online, it means they're probably a lot. So ultimately, I'm like,
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.920]   "Oh, wow." It was over $10,000 for someone to make a wedding video, but I really wanted to do it.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.320]   I got to talking to this woman who's now become a friend of mine. She was living in LA, but she was
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.880]   from Colorado. Amy, my wife was from Colorado. And we went to school there. We were just having
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.560]   good, fun conversations. And it came up that we were going on our honeymoon to the Seychelles.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.000]   I thought for our honeymoon, let's go to the wildest, craziest place we could go.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.120]   And let's, of course, do it on points. We ended up taking this honeymoon that cost...
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   Just the flights alone were $20,000. The hotels were probably another $10,000, $15,000. We did
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.000]   all for free. If you use a credit card that earns two points, and those points are worth two cents,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.240]   then you're effectively getting 4% cash back. We were getting a crazy value from being able to fly
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:39.160]   first class around the world. We ended up doing it in some of the best airlines with private
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.360]   suites and everything. But it was all points. I was telling this woman, Julie, who ran this
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:49.080]   production company about this trip we were taking. And she was like, "You're literally
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.320]   describing my dream vacation." And I was like, "What if we just send you on that vacation also,
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.320]   and you do the wedding for free?" And she was like, "I got to talk to my husband."
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.360]   And she came back. She was like, "We're in." Delta had this crazy promotion where if you send
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.520]   people miles, they would double them. They charge money to send people points, but not nearly enough
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.840]   that it mattered if they were going to double it. So we had all the points ready to book this flight.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.560]   I transferred them from my account to my wife's account. And instantly, we had twice as many.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.520]   For $1,000, we doubled the Delta miles that we needed to go on this trip. And I was like, "Boom,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:30.600]   I just got our wedding video." I had this extra 240,000 points sitting here that we then used to
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:35.720]   send them. And they had an amazing time. And the trip probably would have cost them $20,000.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.240]   So for them, they got a trip worth more than the wedding video. For me, I got a wedding video that
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:46.280]   we'll have for the rest of our lives for the $1,000 it cost to double my Delta miles.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:51.800]   Those kinds of optimizations, those kinds of ways to enrich your life and upgrade your life
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:59.480]   are exactly what I live and thrive for and love sharing every week on Wednesdays at 2am.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:12.520]   I just want to jump in and say thank you so much for listening this week.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.680]   If you enjoyed hearing my story, or honestly, even if you didn't, please let me know.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:22.760]   DM me or email me, chris@allthehacks.com. We'll be back with another interview next week.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.640]   And if you enjoyed this style of interview, you can check out more from Founder Stories.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:36.360]   See you next week.
