[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Now I would like to call your attention this morning to what we have already read together
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:16.640]   in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Luke from verse 46 to verse 55, which
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.640]   we refer to familiarly as the Magnificat, because of the words which Mary uttered at
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   the very beginning of her expression of thanksgiving and of praise, "My soul doth magnify the Lord,"
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.600]   and so on until we come to the end in verse 55.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.160]   Now this statement, this bursting forth of Mary into worship and praise and adoration,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   which as I say we call the Magnificat, is something which is worthy of our most careful
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.720]   consideration.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.440]   There is perhaps no better way of approaching this whole season of the year and the coming
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:17.640]   of Christmas than to do so in terms of a consideration of this particular message.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.600]   Indeed, I think we can say that there is no better test of our understanding of the meaning
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.240]   of the incarnation, everything we think of and celebrate during these years, than our
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.400]   reaction to this song of Mary's.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   Because as I want to try to show you, here in this short compass, in a very extraordinary
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.200]   manner, she brings us face to face with some of the very central matters in connection
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   with our salvation.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.320]   Now, there are many things which are of great interest with which we cannot stay this morning.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.680]   I merely note them in passing.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.840]   It is very interesting, for instance, to notice the stages through which Mary herself passed
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   in connection with this momentous event which was to take place.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.160]   You noticed how when, first of all, the Archangel Gabriel went to her and made his announcement,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.440]   Mary was incredulous.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.840]   She was skeptical.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   She stumbled.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.240]   The thing, of course, was so staggering, so unusual, so amazing, that she could not receive
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.480]   it.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040]   She makes her protestation.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.240]   Indeed, she virtually suggests to the angel that what he is saying is quite impossible.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   But the angel reminds her that with God nothing shall be impossible.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   She must not think in those terms and in those categories.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.960]   She must realize here that she is in a different realm, that he is no ordinary human emissary,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.680]   nor the bearer of a message from any earthly or human power, but that he is the messenger
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.600]   of God.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.160]   And then we notice that as a result of this, Mary goes to this second stage in which she
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   says "Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be ye unto me according to thy word."
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.400]   A most interesting process, this, so typical and characteristic of the way in which the
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   gospel tends to come to all of us.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.880]   At first it seems impossible.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.440]   But then we feel rebuked for that and we say "Well, I don't understand it, but I'll
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   submit."
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   That's what Mary did.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400]   She still doesn't understand.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.640]   "All right," she seems to say, "I hear what you've said to me and I know that what you
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.880]   say is right concerning God, that with God nothing is impossible.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.280]   I therefore leave myself in God's hands."
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   Still not understanding, but ready to wait and to listen and to follow.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   The most important step.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   But then, you remember, she went and visited her cousin Elizabeth.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.880]   And as a result of what happened to Elizabeth, and especially as a result of what Elizabeth
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   said to her, Mary bursts forth into this great song, this great hymn of praise.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.480]   Elizabeth turned to Mary and said, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.920]   of thy womb.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.560]   For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.960]   womb for joy.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.280]   And blessed is she that believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.600]   were told her from the Lord."
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.680]   And that seems to have been the thing used by the Holy Spirit to bring Mary to her real
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.480]   understanding because the moment Elizabeth said that to her, we read, "And Mary said,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:20.840]   My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour."
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:31.640]   Well now, it is thus we see that God used the very words of Elizabeth to confirm to
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.280]   Mary the announcement that had already been made by the archangel.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.800]   And as the result of this, she pours forth her heart in this extraordinary praise and
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.480]   adoration to God.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   And it is to that that I want to call your attention.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.520]   Now let us look at some of the characteristics of these words uttered by Mary.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.280]   First let us obviously notice the depth of feeling, the depth of feeling with which she
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.520]   spoke, which is conveyed, of course, in these words.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.720]   She says, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour."
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.680]   Now she chooses to refer to her soul and her spirit.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.000]   This is a very interesting point, a very interesting theological point.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.800]   She draws a distinction between her soul and her spirit.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.760]   Again, we must not stay with this this morning, and we must not build too much upon it.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.800]   But at any rate, I think we are reminded here as elsewhere in Scripture that whether the
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.360]   soul and spirit are essentially one or not, there is a distinction between them.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.720]   The soul in general passes for the rational powers.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.040]   When the expression "soul" is used in this way in contradistinction to "spirit,"
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.440]   it is meant to refer to the intellect and to the feelings, the way in which we correspond
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.200]   with one another and have fellowship and relationship with one another.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.560]   The soul is essentially the rational part of man.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   What is the spirit then?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.920]   Well, the spirit rather represents the perception.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.520]   There is a difference between ability and understanding.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.220]   There is a difference between knowledge and perception.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:41.700]   The spirit is a higher faculty, a higher aspect of this position which we all have.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.740]   It includes the capacity for worship.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.580]   The soul, in other words, is that which links us to all that is round and about us, to man
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.060]   and to animals, to history and to the world and all we can see.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.100]   That's the soul.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.940]   But the spirit is that part, if you like, even of the soul, if you want to argue that
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.860]   there are only two parts in men and not three parts.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.260]   Nevertheless, you must say that there is this compartment, as it were, of the soul which
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:20.660]   enables one to appreciate the unseen and the spiritual, the higher, everything that is
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.460]   greatest and uttermost in men.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.020]   Well now then, Mary uses the two expressions "my soul" and "my spirit," by which
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:38.100]   she means this, that she is moved in the very depth and center of her being.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.420]   She is not merely pleased in a general sense and on the surface.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.860]   It's not merely something of general interest to her.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:56.300]   She has got a realization of something that she says has touched her in the very center
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.020]   and the most vital part of her personality.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.620]   Now this is why all this is so important.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.780]   That is the effect, you see, of the good news of salvation upon the soul.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.460]   This is the effect to which it has always led when people have rarely understood what
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.380]   it's all about.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.900]   In other words, we come back to a theme we were dealing with recently in the fifth chapter
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.300]   of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:30.940]   There is all the difference between mere singing and making melody in our hearts.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.540]   The heart, you see, includes, as it were, this same thing, the soul and spirit, the
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.660]   very center of men's whole personality.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:46.500]   And it is there that this response to the gospel really comes forth.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   That's where it emanates.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   That's where it has its origin.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:57.780]   And thus we find Mary, obviously, stirred to the very depths of her soul.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:06.340]   And the result is that she speaks with a sense of dignity and of greatness.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:13.460]   She is aware of something profound, and you can't read through what she said without
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:22.060]   sensing her sense of awe and of wonder, of worship and of amazement.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.780]   My soul, my spirit.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.860]   This she seems to be saying is the most amazing thing I've ever known.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.500]   I am beyond and beside myself.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.420]   My soul and my spirit.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   Very well.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.540]   There, then, I say is the first thing that emerges and the first thing, therefore, by
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.940]   which we test ourselves.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.180]   You but read the New Testament to see that all men who truly have understood the gospel
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.340]   have said something similar.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.940]   You read even the psalmist looking forward to it.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.140]   He says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.980]   Bless his holy name."
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.500]   I could quote hymns to you.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:16.580]   I could quote statements to you of the saints throughout the centuries.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.340]   They're all saying the same thing.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.180]   And of course it must be true.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.140]   If we do really understand what happened when the Son of God left the courts of heaven and
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.700]   came into this world in this way and manner, if we do grasp something of its eternal significance,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:38.220]   of its profundity, its amazing character, how can it fail to move us, especially in
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.660]   our souls and in our spirits?
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.660]   That's the test.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:52.700]   And here, you see, we are again reminded of how this season can be so abused, even in
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.220]   the church.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.820]   While men talk about themselves and one another and about a Christmas spirit.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   No, no.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.820]   This is the dimension.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.820]   This is it.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.060]   It's not just a good feeling of goodwill and a friendliness and a happiness.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.260]   It is something, if we really get hold of it, that moves us in the soul and in the spirit.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.940]   Well, let me go to a second point.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:20.540]   There is the depth of the feeling, but look for a moment at the manifestation of this
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.900]   feeling.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.180]   Then two words come out.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.220]   The first is the element of adoration.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.700]   My soul doth magnify the Lord.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.380]   Now, this is an extraordinary expression.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.540]   It means to make great and to make glorious.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.700]   But says someone, what a foolish term.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   How can one magnify God?
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:50.020]   How can a human being, a creature, one who is but a created being, how can one magnify,
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.180]   make great, multiply, as it were, the Lord God Almighty?
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.860]   Well, of course, in an ultimate sense it can't be done.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.780]   And Mary realized that, as all the psalmists who use the term realized it.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.660]   And yet there is a sense in which it's very true.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:14.160]   Because while we cannot do anything as such to God in his greatness and in his majesty,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.260]   we can help other people to see it.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.500]   We can, as it were, act as a kind of lens that makes him greater in the eyes and in
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.220]   the estimate and in the sight of people.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.100]   And that is what Mary was trying to express.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:36.700]   It is as if she was saying, how can I make known what I have seen of the greatness and
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.180]   of the glory of God?
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.420]   That's what she's expressing.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.140]   I want everybody to know this.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.720]   I want everybody to see it.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.820]   My soul doth magnify the Lord.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.660]   I'm thinking, I'm clutching at every expression that I can get hold of in order to express
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.980]   something of his greatness and something of his glory.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.940]   That's what she's expressing.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:08.740]   It is then, I say, a very profound way of giving expression to this depth of desire
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:16.620]   that God might be known and might be seen, that what he is might be brought in a large
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.140]   way and painted on an enormous canvas that the whole world may see it and look at it
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.280]   and bow before him in adoration and in praise.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.860]   My soul doth magnify the Lord.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.060]   Well, here we are again.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.540]   I'm simply taking these words this morning and holding them before you in order that
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.940]   we may examine ourselves in the light of them.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.700]   Do our souls magnify the Lord?
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.540]   Is this our innermost desire?
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.180]   The psalmist has expressed it, you know.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.780]   The psalmist has said, "Oh, come," he says, "and magnify the Lord with me."
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.020]   Let's do it together, he says.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.300]   Let everybody join in.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.540]   Let us make his name great.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.220]   Let us hold it before the nations and the peoples.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.940]   The other expression is "rejoice."
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:18.260]   My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.820]   Now, the word "rejoice" isn't quite good enough.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   It isn't quite strong enough.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.020]   The word really means to exalt it.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.700]   If you like, it means to make your boast of it.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.020]   This is the thing in which I exult.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.580]   The world is always exulting in various things.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.780]   Men exult in themselves.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.660]   They make their proud boast of themselves.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   They praise themselves.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:49.140]   "Oh," says Mary, "my spirit exults in God."
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.980]   Here is the theme of my rejoicing.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.500]   In God my Saviour.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.280]   Well, let's go on to the next step to see the full significance of this.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.580]   What is the cause of this feeling within her?
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.740]   Here we come to what I want to emphasize particularly this morning.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.980]   Why is Mary magnifying the Lord?
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.220]   Why does her spirit exult in God her Saviour?
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.380]   She really supplies us with the answer.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.340]   It is not primarily because of what had happened to her.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:30.180]   She does mention that it comes in, but that is a mere incident in her hymn of praise.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.340]   What is the cause of her exultation and of her adoration, of her praise?
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:46.500]   Well, it is because God himself is who and what he is, and because of what he is doing
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.060]   with respect to the world.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.420]   Mary's eye, in other words, is not upon herself.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:17:00.660]   You see how certain parts of the Church have so abused and made an utter travesty of this.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.540]   Mary is full of humility.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.940]   She refers to herself as what she was, "the lowest state of thine handmaiden."
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:15.900]   There is nothing here about the Mother of God and about the Queen of Heaven.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.620]   Mary is not thinking about herself.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.340]   Mary has seen something that makes her forget herself.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:30.180]   And this is the ultimate test of a true understanding of what happened when God, in the fullness
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.140]   of the times, sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.860]   Mary is rejoicing, not in the fact so much that she is to be given this great privilege.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.740]   She has been reminded by Elizabeth of what it is, and that people are going to call her
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.820]   blessed, and she repeats that, that all generations from henceforth shall call me blessed.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.320]   But that isn't the thing that really moves her.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.980]   What is the thing that makes her magnify the Lord and her spirit to exalt in God her Savior?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:06.100]   Well, it is, I say, what God is doing, this historic event, this climactic action of God
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.620]   himself.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.300]   She is humbled and grateful at the thought of the fact that she is to be given a part
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:19.660]   and a place in this, but it is the thing itself that moves her and makes her sing and worship.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:26.140]   She is filled with a sense of amazement, of worship, adoration, and utter astonishment.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.140]   Why?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.060]   Well, she sees the inner meaning of the action.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:38.620]   She has got a glimpse and a glimmering of understanding of the whole purpose of salvation,
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:45.220]   of what God is doing in bringing forth the Son of His in the world, even out of her womb.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.380]   Now that's, you see, the whole secret of this song.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:57.260]   As I say also, it is the whole secret of the whole Christian position.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:04.180]   What is it, in other words, that leads to worship and to praise, to exaltation, to adoration?
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:10.860]   And the answer is, it is always understanding.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.620]   You see, the only singing that is of any value in the sight of God is that which is based
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.860]   upon the understanding, the understanding of the truth.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.900]   That is why we must take this occasion to remind ourselves, therefore, that we must
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.140]   never go for the emotions directly.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.500]   We must never go for the will directly.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:36.340]   The emotions and the will are the result of something seen by the understanding.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.660]   That is what Elizabeth shows.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.560]   She was filled with the Holy Ghost, we are told, and she spoke forth with understanding
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.720]   enlightenment of the Spirit.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.500]   And exactly the same thing is true here of Mary.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:55.000]   And what Mary sees is not that she is to be made great because she has this privilege,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.760]   but the greatness of the God who is acting, and the greatness of the action which he is
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   taking.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.740]   So let us follow her in the expression of her feeling.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.380]   That is my fourth point, the expression of her feeling.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.060]   What does she say?
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:18.700]   Well, the main thing here, of course, is that Mary is telling us certain things about God
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.920]   as he is.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.740]   She is adoring God for being what he is.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.980]   And this is the very essence of Christian worship and of Christian praise.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:40.660]   Alas, in our weakness and frailty, we are so concerned with benefits that we forget
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.320]   the giver.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.940]   But here is adoration and worship at its very best.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.900]   Now, there are two dangers confronting us.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:55.300]   There is the danger to which I have already referred, the monstrosity of the false teaching
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.100]   and the exaggeration of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:04.600]   But let us be careful also that in a violent reaction against that, we do not underestimate
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.580]   what Mary saw and what she expressed in the Magnificat.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.620]   Let us keep to the balance of the Scripture and not be governed by prejudices.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:20.420]   And here she is, you see, expressing the very heart and soul and center of Christian praise
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.540]   and worship and adoration.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.820]   God himself, what?
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.580]   Well, first and foremost, his greatness and his glory.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:35.140]   My soul doth magnify the Lord.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.860]   There is nothing above that.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.620]   We will never rise above that.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:49.780]   To magnify the Lord, the Lord is Jehovah, and he is to be magnified and praised and
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.620]   worshipped because of that.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.620]   Who is he?
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.540]   He says, "I am that I am."
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.620]   There is the element in it also, "I am what I shall become."
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:09.580]   But the great central thing is this, that he is from eternity to eternity.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:15.060]   I am that I am, the Lord.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.900]   "Great is the Lord," says the psalmist, "and greatly to be praised."
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:32.860]   You see, my dear friends, we have not understood the meaning of Christmas unless we come there.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.580]   We do not stop in the stable and with the manger.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:45.060]   Of course we must go there, but you see, what we see there is this great God, the Lord.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.260]   And the moment you do that, you get your right perspective, you get your right way of looking
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.260]   at things.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.900]   Haven't we reached a terrible pass when it is essential to remind Christian people that
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:01.220]   they must not allow their thinking to be governed by the world at a time like this, but by the
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.460]   Scripture and its teaching?
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.480]   And this is the scriptural way.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.460]   You start with this Lord, you magnify the Lord.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.460]   Why?
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   Well, He is responsible for everything that has happened.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.740]   It is His action.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.180]   He is the one who is ultimately to be praised.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.180]   Well then take the second term, "Savior."
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:33.680]   "My soul," she says, "doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God, my Savior."
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.100]   What does the term "Savior" mean?
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.500]   Well, it is a great term used by the Bible everywhere concerning God.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   It is the one who delivers.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.260]   It is the one who keeps.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.820]   This is a wonderful summary of Old Testament history that we have in this Magnificat.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.300]   You see, what Mary is saying is this, "Oh God, my soul doth magnify Thee."
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.300]   Why?
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.100]   Well, I can see now that you are doing what you have always done.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.460]   You are always the same.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.220]   You have been doing it throughout the centuries, but now here is the climax.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.900]   And it is the climax of all that has gone before.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.040]   The Savior.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.020]   That was God's character with respect to Israel, wasn't it?
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.140]   Read your Old Testament.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.140]   What is it?
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.620]   It is a history of God ever delivering these people.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.820]   Look how He delivered them out of the captivity and the bondage of Egypt.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.820]   They would have perished there.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   It would have been the end.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.180]   Well, how did they ever come out?
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.900]   How did they ever go to the land of Canaan, the land of possession?
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.260]   It was God, the Savior, who brought them out with His strong arm.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.540]   The Savior, of course.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.820]   And so He continued to be.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.620]   How often did He deliver them from their cruel enemies?
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.900]   How often did He vanquish mighty armies when they were comparatively defenseless?
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.300]   Read the historical books and you will see God the Savior.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   Mary sees all this.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:58.060]   And then go on and see how even from the captivity of Babylon He brought back a remnant to carry
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.420]   on His purpose.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.940]   It is always God the Savior.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.940]   And thus the psalmist says very rightly, "He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.880]   nor sleep."
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.660]   Even when they were rebellious and sinful, He kept His eye upon them.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.420]   He allows things to go so far but never further.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.880]   He allows enemies to arise and conquer them but never to destroy them.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.860]   He is the Savior of His people.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.780]   He is the shepherd of the flock.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.940]   My Savior, Mary sees it.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:36.140]   And now she suddenly sees that God is doing this on an infinitely bigger scale.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.460]   God my Savior, what is this action?
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.380]   What is He doing to me, she seems to say.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.740]   Ah, this is a part of His salvation for the world.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.500]   God my Savior.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:54.380]   And then she comes and pays special attention to His power.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.720]   She is very impressed by this.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   Listen to her.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.900]   "He that is mighty" in verse 49, "He that is mighty hath done to me great things."
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.660]   And again in verse 51, "He hath showed strength with His arm.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:16.300]   He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.860]   He that is mighty.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:23.740]   Ah, it is not surprising that she emphasizes this.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:31.100]   It is this, if I may so put it, that enables God to be the Savior.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.700]   If this were not true of God, He could not be the Savior.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.480]   And this is the thing that is especially needed by the world, this thing that is especially
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.060]   needed by all of us.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.020]   Why does she magnify God for His greatness, for His power, and for His strength?
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:56.820]   Well, she contrasts it with her own weakness, and with the utter weakness and helplessness
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.340]   and hopelessness of the world.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:07.060]   The hope for the world this morning is the power of God, the strength of His arm.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.820]   He that is mighty.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.220]   He is almighty.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.860]   The angel had fortunately reminded her of that.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.860]   She had stumbled.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.540]   "How can this be, seeing that I know not a man?
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.940]   You are telling me that I am to bring forth a son, but I am a virgin, I have never known
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.940]   a man.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.940]   How can this be?
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.940]   The thing is impossible."
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   And the answer is, "With God nothing shall be impossible."
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.940]   Thank God.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.700]   He has the essence of salvation.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.220]   It is the might and strength of God.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.380]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ," says Paul.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.100]   It is the power of God, and to salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.380]   The power.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.020]   And Mary's soul magnifies the Lord because of this, and so should ours.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.780]   Look at it like this.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:00.740]   The world is as it is because it is in the grip and under the power of the devil and
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.620]   of hell.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.220]   The devil is the God of this world.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.140]   He is the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.260]   of disobedience.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.160]   And his power is a mighty power.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.700]   You go back and read your Old Testament, look at him as he tempts the greatest patriarch
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   and saint.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:26.800]   They fall before him in utter weakness and helplessness.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.660]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:40.760]   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.520]   Is there any hope for the world this morning?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.540]   Does it lie in conferences in Paris or somewhere else?
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.540]   Does it lie in the future?
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.780]   No, it doesn't.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.500]   The world goes round and round in circles.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.780]   It lacks the power to deal with the situation.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:01.000]   But thank God we are reminded this morning of one that is mighty.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.340]   He has showed strength with his arm.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.460]   He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.080]   He is the Almighty One.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.000]   He is God.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.340]   Now that is the first and primary name that is used with respect to God in the Bible.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.780]   It is the word El, and it means "the strong one."
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.220]   When God was revealing himself to the people, that is the name he used.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.520]   I am the strong one, the Almighty.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.480]   And so, you see, the Archangel Gabriel is reminding Mary of something that is crucial
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.680]   and vital in this whole situation.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:46.720]   There would be no salvation for this world were it not that God is the Mighty One, the
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.240]   Almighty.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.520]   And what he is doing there in Bethlehem is manifesting his power, the power of God, unto
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   salvation.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:02.000]   An extraordinary thing, a still more extraordinary way of doing it, but that is what he is doing.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.620]   God is putting into motion his plan.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.720]   It is working out according to his power.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.500]   Then we hurry to the next point which he makes, and that is his holiness.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.240]   Did you notice this?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:23.720]   He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.160]   I wonder whether you have ever stopped at that and asked the question, "Why does she
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   say that there?
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.680]   Why does she bring that in at all?"
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.440]   And you notice especially that she connects it with the power by means of the word "and."
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   "I magnify the Lord," she says, "not only for his power, but also for his holiness."
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   Why the holiness?
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:55.720]   Well, this again is one of the keys to the understanding of the whole purpose of salvation.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.880]   Why is there a salvation?
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.560]   Why did God ever send his only Son into this world?
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.960]   Why was there ever a cross on Calvary's hill?
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.280]   And you know, in the last analysis, this is the answer.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.000]   Because God is holy.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.480]   Because his name is holy.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   What does it mean?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.360]   Well, the Bible puts it in many ways.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.720]   "God is light," it says, "and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.960]   He is a burning fire.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.160]   That is an expression of God's holiness.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.200]   What has it got to do with salvation, says someone?
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.480]   Well, it has this to do with it.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.760]   God is not only the eternal opposite to sin.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.000]   God is eternally opposed to sin.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.400]   God hates sin.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.040]   And it is because God hates sin that there is a salvation.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Look at it like this.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   God made the world, made it perfect.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   There was nothing wrong.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   There was no blemish.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.240]   He looked at it and saw that it was good.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   But sin came in.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.360]   The devil introduced evil.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.280]   Sin has become rampant.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.400]   Evil is widespread.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.680]   And God in his holiness cannot tolerate it.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.160]   It is because God hates sin with all the intensity of his holy nature that there is a salvation.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.480]   I do not hesitate to make a statement like this.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:34.000]   I say that it is because his name is holy that he must deal with sin, that he must bring
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.520]   in redemption.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.400]   God being God cannot leave the world as it is, in sin, under the power of the devil,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   ruled by the God of this world.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   No, no.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:51.520]   That is utterly opposed to him, and he hates it, and he will get rid of it.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:58.000]   His name is holy, and because it is, he has done what he has done.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.640]   And everything God does is holy.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.000]   It is not merely powerful.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.440]   It is holy.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.840]   Did you notice, indeed, how the archangel Gabriel put it to Mary herself?
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   He said, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee."
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:20.880]   And then did you notice that amazing expression, "That holy thing that shall be born of thee."
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.520]   Everything about this salvation is holy.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.640]   Jesus Christ was perfect.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.680]   There was no sin in him.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.960]   He did not inherit Adam's nature, the sin that was in Adam's nature.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.040]   He was pure.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   He was holy.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.080]   "That holy thing that shall be born of thee."
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.880]   And right through the whole of his teaching, and in everything that he did, this element
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.640]   of holiness always comes out.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.120]   Mary is born as a babe, yes, but he is not an ordinary babe.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.520]   He is separate from sin, separate from sinners.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.840]   No sin in him.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   Holy.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.040]   Jump right to the cross.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.640]   What is happening there?
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.840]   Ah, it is the same element of holiness that I see.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.000]   It is God's hatred of sin, God punishing sin, God getting rid of sin.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.320]   Holy is his name.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:20.400]   Everything in connection with this great movement of salvation from beginning to end is characterized
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   by holiness.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.680]   But there is one other term.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.840]   Listen to it.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.040]   It is this wonderful term, mercy.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.240]   And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.080]   Once more I ask you to notice the word "and" at the beginning of that fiftieth verse.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:46.920]   And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.160]   Thank God for this "and."
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.880]   Why well for this good reason.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:01.440]   If God were only almighty and holy, there would be no hope for us at all.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.800]   If it were only true to say of God that he is the mighty one, the almighty one, that
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:13.440]   he is holy and of such a pure countenance that he cannot even look upon sin, we would
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.600]   not be meeting together like this this morning.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.640]   We would not be singing these hymns of praise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   Why?
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.400]   Well, because if God were only almighty and holy, we should all be blotted out.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.500]   The whole world would be destroyed.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.480]   There would be no salvation.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.520]   But thank God for this little "and."
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:48.320]   His mercy, great in power, glorious in holiness and in majesty.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.520]   But thank God full of mercy and full of compassion.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.920]   This is the thing that saves us.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.320]   What does mercy mean?
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.600]   Well, perhaps the best way to answer that question is to consider it in the light of
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   the word "grace."
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.680]   Grace and mercy go together, and grace comes before mercy.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   What is grace?
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:14.240]   Well, grace is love and favor toward those who do not deserve it because of their guilt.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.120]   Grace is kindness and goodness revealed to those who do not deserve it because they are
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   guilty.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.360]   That is what grace means.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360]   What is mercy?
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:33.960]   Well, mercy means love toward those who are not merely guilty, but who are miserable in
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:39.200]   their guilt, and who are miserable because they are guilty.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.800]   That is the difference between grace and mercy.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.320]   Grace is more general.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.880]   Mercy is particular.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:55.520]   His mercy, which means this, that God looks down and sees mankind in its misery, in its
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.960]   agony, in its pain.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.200]   Now, of course, as I have already reminded you, Mary is summarizing the whole history
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   of the Old Testament.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:08.240]   Do you remember what God said to Moses when he called him to deliver the children of Israel?
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:15.640]   This is how he put it, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:26.760]   and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows."
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.520]   If that does not melt us and break us, what can?
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.560]   That is mercy.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:40.600]   This great self-existent God who is from eternity to eternity, everlasting in his holiness and
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:47.680]   in his glory, the God who could exist apart from men and who does not need men.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.640]   He created men, and men in his folly fell into sin, and there he is in his misery and
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:59.080]   unhappiness and wretchedness, and this august eternal God says, "I have surely seen the
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.760]   affliction of my people.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.360]   I have looked upon it.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.520]   I have seen it.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:19.480]   I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows."
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   That is why Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.640]   That is why he came so willingly.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.280]   That is why he laid aside the signs of his glory and humbled himself and made himself
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.680]   of no reputation.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:46.760]   God had seen our misery, not only our guilt but our misery, our unhappiness, our unwretchedness,
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.080]   the state of the world as the result of sin.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   As John Milton puts it in his hymn, "He hath with a piteous eye looked upon our misery,
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:05.520]   for his mercy is ever faithful, ever sure."
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:14.200]   Mary praises God for his mercy, his compassion, for his piteous eye.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.280]   And then I merely mention it, I am not going to stay with it, his faithfulness.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:27.760]   "He hath opened his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy, as he spake to our fathers,
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.920]   to Abram and to his seed forever."
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.960]   God never forgets his promise.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   God had promised that he would visit and redeem his people, and Mary sees of a sudden that
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.800]   what is happening to her is a part of this fulfillment of the promises of God.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.880]   All the Old Testament prophets had been waiting and longing and crying out, as it were, "Oh
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.760]   come, oh come, Emmanuel, when will he come?
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.480]   God has promised him, when will he appear?"
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   She realizes that at last he is about to appear, that the holy thing that is to be born out
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:27.160]   of her womb is God's "Yea, and Amen" to all the promises that he had made, beginning
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:36.920]   in the Garden of Eden itself and continuing through prophets and seers and sages and kings
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.320]   and psalmists.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:50.000]   Even unto this very hour, God hath visited and hath redeemed his people.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:00.480]   For his mercy is ever faithful, ever sure.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.280]   That is why Mary speaks as she does.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:17.320]   That is why she says, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   my Savior, the Almighty, the Holy One, the One who hath mercy and compassion, who for
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:40.760]   his great love wherewith he loved us hath sent his only Son, not only into the world
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   but even to the death of the cross, great in might, great in mercy.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:42:03.040]   Oh, the riches of his grace, the unsearchable riches of his grace toward us, in his Son,
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.560]   our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   Have you seen it?
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.280]   Mary saw it in a flash.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.800]   She stumbled, she couldn't.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.040]   At last she sees it, the movement of God in salvation, and that's the response.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:29.880]   "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior."
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.720]   Does it come to you like that?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.000]   Well, meditate upon it.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.640]   Meditate upon it in terms of Scripture.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:44.120]   See that it ever leads you to God, who in his glory, in his majesty, has looked upon
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:55.640]   us and the world with such a piteous eye as to send his only Son into it for our redemption.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.280]   Amen.
