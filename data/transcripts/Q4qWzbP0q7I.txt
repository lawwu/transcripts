[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.400]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.420]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.600]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.760]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.520]   Today, we're talking all about emotions.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.200]   Emotions are central to our entire experience of life.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.240]   Whether or not we're happy or sad or depressed or angry
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.440]   is our life experience.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000]   And yet, I think with all the importance
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.360]   that we've placed on emotions,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.720]   very few people actually understand
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   how emotions arise in our brain and body.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.840]   And I mentioned brain and body because as you'll see today,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.500]   emotions really capture the brain-body relationship.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.520]   We cannot say that emotions arise
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.320]   just from what happens in our head.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.520]   The other thing about emotions
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.640]   is that there's no real agreement
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.800]   as to what's a good emotion or a bad emotion.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.600]   Today, we're going to talk about the biology
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.720]   of the chemicals and pathways that give rise to emotions
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.680]   in the context of food and nutrition.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280]   The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.440]   going back to Darwin and even long before Darwin.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680]   You know, this is a conversation that philosophers
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160]   and scientists have been having for hundreds,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.360]   if not thousands of years.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.000]   You know, the idea that Darwin put forth
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.100]   and that was really attractive for about the last 100 years
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.680]   was that emotions are universal
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.200]   and that some of the facial expressions
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.880]   around emotion are universal.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.560]   And other people have, you know, capitalized on that idea.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.200]   And to some extent, it's true.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.960]   I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of that
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.440]   would be when we see something or we smell something
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.280]   or we taste something that we like,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.660]   there does tend to be a postural leaning in.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.120]   We tend to inhale air at that time.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.720]   We tend to bring in more
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.440]   of whatever chemical substance is there.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.560]   So we tend to do these mmms and, you know,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.180]   and kind of lean in closer to things
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.800]   that are attractive to us.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.320]   And when we see and experience things that we don't like,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.900]   sometimes it's a mild aversion.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.640]   We just kind of lean back or look away.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.740]   Other times, it's an intense aversion of disgust.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380]   And we tend to cringe our face.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.740]   We tend to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.880]   This probably has roots in ancient biological mechanisms
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.580]   that are to prevent us from ingesting things
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.600]   that are bad for us,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.480]   chemical compounds and tastes that might be poisonous.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.780]   So much of the foundation of any discussion about emotion
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960]   has to center around this kind of push-pull
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.720]   of attraction to things or aversion from things.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.600]   Now, that's a very basic way of thinking about emotions.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   But if you think about it,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.960]   it works for a lot of different circumstances.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.120]   And in the brain,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.320]   everywhere from the deep circuits of the brain
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.480]   to the more kind of what we call higher order
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.080]   revolve centers of the brain,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.280]   we have this push-pull thing.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   We're either, in a previous episode, I talked about go,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.480]   the circuits that allow you to emphasize action.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   And then no-go circuits,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.540]   the circuits in the basal ganglia
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.320]   that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent action.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.680]   And so we can break down the discussion about emotions
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.660]   into these simpler versions of themselves.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.680]   But at the core of that, of attraction or aversion
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.040]   is an important theme that you might realize already,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.920]   but most people tend to overlook,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.320]   which is that there's an action there.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.840]   You're either moving forward
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.700]   or you're moving away from something.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.660]   The brain has a body so that the organism can move.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.400]   And the body has a brain so that the organism, you,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.200]   can move toward or away from things
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.600]   that you deem to be good or bad for you.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.240]   So there are circuits in the brain for aversion
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.100]   and for attraction toward things.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.700]   And the body is governing a lot of that.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.660]   And so immediately in this conversation,
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.820]   I want to raise an important point,
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.100]   which is about a nerve pathway
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.220]   that many, many people have heard of
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.700]   that gets discussed all the time.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.820]   And that is one of the most kind of oversold
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.940]   for the wrong reasons and undersold, unfortunately,
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.340]   for its real power, which is the vagus nerve.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.020]   So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.920]   but one way in which our brain and body are connected
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.400]   and regulates our emotional states.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.800]   So what is the vagus nerve?
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   Vagus is the 10th cranial nerve,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.840]   which basically means that the neurons,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.460]   the control center of each of those neurons in the vagus,
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.880]   lives just kind of near the neck, right?
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.520]   And a branch of the vagus goes into the brain.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.560]   The other branch goes into the periphery,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.260]   but not just the gut.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.040]   It goes into the stomach, the intestines, the heart,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   the lungs, and the immune system.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.720]   So the way to think about the vagus
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.800]   is the same way I would think about the eyes.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   The eyes are looking at colors, they're looking at motion,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.120]   they're looking how bright it is.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.960]   And each one of those things, those features,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.320]   is telling the brain something different
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.660]   so the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.360]   whether or not it's looking at somebody
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   attractive or unattractive.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.820]   The vagus nerve is also analyzing many features
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.280]   within the body and informing the brain
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.840]   of how to feel about that and what to do.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.200]   So a really good example that I think is an exciting one
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.900]   is as it relates to sugar.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.440]   So we all know that sweet things generally taste good.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   So that makes sense, right?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.160]   You eat something, it tastes sweet, you want more of it.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.560]   Well, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.680]   When you eat something sweet, within your stomach,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.560]   you have cells, neurons, that sense the presence
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   of sugary foods, independent of their taste,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.080]   and signal to the brain, so those sensors, those neurons,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.880]   send information up the vagus to your brain,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.440]   goes through a series of stations,
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.640]   and then you release dopamine, this molecule
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.560]   that makes you want more of whatever it is
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.120]   that you just ingested.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.160]   In fact, this pathway is so powerful
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.360]   that they've done experiments where they completely numb
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.380]   all the taste and feeling in somebody's mouth.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.640]   They're blindfolded, so they don't know
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.560]   what they're eating, and they're eating a food
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.720]   that's either sugary or not sugary.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.360]   And what they find is that even though
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.560]   people can't taste the sugary food,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.440]   they crave more of the food that contains sugar
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.240]   because of the sensors in the gut that sense sugar.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.260]   And what it tells us is that we have circuits in our body
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.740]   that are driving us towards certain behaviors
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.640]   and making us feel good, even though we can't perceive them.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.360]   Now, for those of you that are really interested
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.240]   in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.600]   this is a gut feeling,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.720]   except this is a chemical gut feeling.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.480]   This is a particular set of neurons
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.260]   detecting that something in your body
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.060]   has a particular feature, in this case,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.720]   the presence of sugars, and sending information
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.440]   to the brain essentially to control your behavior.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.400]   And I find this remarkable.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.360]   I mean, this should completely reframe the way
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.200]   that we think about the so-called hidden sugars in foods.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   What this means is that even if a food is very savory,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.880]   like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.680]   or even like a salad dressing,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.360]   if there's sugar snuck into that and you can't taste it,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.520]   you will still crave more of that thing
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.720]   without knowing that you crave it because it has sugar.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600]   So I find this to be a fascinating aspect of our biology.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   A lot of how we feel while we eat and after we eat
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.180]   is because of this vagus sensing of what's in our gut.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.640]   It's sending information all the time.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.400]   Is there sugar?
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.940]   Are there fats?
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.980]   Are there contaminants?
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.380]   There are a lot of information,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.700]   these so-called parallel pathways
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.940]   that are going up into our brain
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.660]   that regulate whether or not we want to eat
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.140]   more of something or not.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.580]   And there are accelerators,
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.500]   things that make us want to eat more,
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.140]   like sugar and fats, because those are nutrient dense
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.380]   and they helps generally, at least in the short term,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.940]   support the survival of animals, but also amino acids.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.260]   And this is very important.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260]   There are a lot of data,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260]   but much of what comes from the data on what people eat
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.220]   and how much they eat is from a subconscious detection
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.900]   of how many amino acids and what the array,
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.380]   meaning the constellation of amino acids is in a given food.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.300]   And it's fair to say that the sum total of these studies,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.880]   point in a direction where people will basically eat,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.540]   not until their stomach is full,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.260]   but until the brain perceives
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.100]   that they have adequate intake of amino acids.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.500]   It's amino acids, of course,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.540]   are important because they are the building blocks of sure,
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.240]   muscle and the other things in our body that need repair.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.220]   But what most people don't realize is that amino acids
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.540]   are what the neurochemicals in the brain are made from.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.020]   Now, this is vitally important, okay?
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.820]   So we've heard dopamine is this molecule
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.780]   that makes you feel good.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.000]   Dopamine release is caused by surprise, excitement,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.340]   events that you're looking forward to
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.140]   and that turn out well.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.660]   It is inhibited by events you're looking forward to
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.000]   that don't work out.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.180]   It's called reward prediction error.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.580]   Your expectation of something releases dopamine
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.940]   and the actual event releases dopamine.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.420]   And if the event related dopamine
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.660]   does not exceed the expectation or at least match it,
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.180]   there's a much higher tendency
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.940]   that you won't pursue that thing again.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.940]   Dopamine is what's going to lead us
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.700]   to want to eat more of something
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.380]   or to not want more of something
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.360]   because dopamine really is about craving.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.340]   It's about motivation and it's about desire.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.400]   And as I mentioned,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.660]   these amino acid sensors in our gut
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.000]   are detecting how many amino acids,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.520]   but they're also detecting which amino acids.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.820]   And there's a particular amino acid called L-tyrosine
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.560]   which comes from food.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.360]   It is in meats, it is in nuts,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.900]   it is also in some plant-based foods.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.900]   L-tyrosine is the precursor to a couple other molecules
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.440]   like L-DOPA, et cetera, that make dopamine.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.740]   However, the dopamine neurons that give rise
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.920]   to these feelings of good or wanting more
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.180]   or desire and motivation, those reside in the brain.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.460]   So we don't want to get too confused.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.240]   We want to respect and honor the power of the gut
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.680]   and this vagal pathway,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.300]   but it's really neurons within your brain
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.200]   that drive the pursuit and decision-making.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.160]   So what does this mean?
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.000]   Well, some people make too little dopamine.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.480]   Some people make so little dopamine
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.840]   that they need prescription dopamine.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.800]   They need L-DOPA.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.920]   People with Parkinson's take L-DOPA
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.960]   and other compounds to increase dopamine
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.440]   because Parkinson's is associated
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.680]   with deficits in movement.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.160]   Parkinson's is a depression.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.280]   It's a blunting of motivation and mood and affect,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.160]   and it's a tremor.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.840]   And then eventually in severe conditions,
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.960]   it's challenges in speaking and walking.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.040]   So some famous examples would be Muhammad Ali,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.920]   Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.880]   Like these people have Parkinson's
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.800]   and they, at least later in their life,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.580]   had challenges speaking.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.240]   Now, some people immediately ask,
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.120]   well, should I supplement L-tyrosine?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.080]   It does increase kind of mood and elevation and alertness.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.200]   It is over the counter.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.460]   You have to check with your doctor.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.960]   I'm not responsible for your healthcare,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.480]   and I'm not a doctor.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.520]   Whether or not it's safe for you.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.440]   People with preexisting hyper-dopaminergic conditions
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.360]   like mania should probably not take L-tyrosine.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.880]   The other thing about taking L-tyrosine
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.600]   is there is a crash, okay?
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.320]   It's not a massive crash if you take it
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.740]   at appropriate doses and it's right for you,
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.560]   but it can produce a crash and a lethargy
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.000]   and a kind of brain fog after the next day or so.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And so L-tyrosine, however, can be ingested through foods
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.400]   or through supplementation to increase dopamine levels.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.240]   That's well-known.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.740]   Taking chronically, however,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.940]   it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.600]   Let's just kind of take stock of where we're at.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   We have a brain-body connection.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.160]   There are many of them,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.120]   but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   The vagus collects information about a lot of things,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.240]   breathing, heart rate,
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.560]   stuff that's happening in the gut, et cetera.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.040]   And gut, by the way, includes the stomach
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.000]   and the intestines,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.280]   sends that information up to the brain.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.960]   The brain is using that information
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.680]   to decide one of two things,
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.200]   move toward something or move away.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   It can also pause,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.000]   but essentially pausing is not moving toward.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.440]   So that's the dopamine pathway.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.160]   And foods rich in L-tyrosine
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.080]   generally give us an elevated mood
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.200]   and make us want to do more of whatever it is
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   that we happen to be doing, as well as other things.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.440]   Motivation generalizes to other things.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.800]   It's not unique to just ingesting foods.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.600]   But foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.480]   will make us crave more of that food.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.800]   It will make us crave more of the activity
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.480]   that led to the ingestion of that food.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.520]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.420]   a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.960]   that you're not even aware of.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.360]   So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.440]   in the context of the vagus is serotonin.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.840]   Serotonin, just to remind you, is a neuromodulator.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.300]   Therefore, it creates a bias in which neural circuits,
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.320]   which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active,
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.600]   and it makes it less likely
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.920]   that other ones are going to be active.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.560]   And serotonin, when it's elevated,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.840]   tends to make us feel really comfortable
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.720]   and kind of blissed out wherever we are.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.240]   And that contrasts with dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.920]   which mainly put us in pursuit of things.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   Motivation is pursuit.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.060]   The conversation around the brain-body relationship
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.000]   and mood in serotonin for many years was,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.560]   well, you eat a big meal, the gut is distended,
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.860]   you've got all the nutrients you need,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.400]   you rest and digest, and serotonin is released.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.440]   That's sort of true, but there's a lot more going on
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.560]   and a lot more that's interesting and actionable
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.640]   that's going on.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.280]   First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.920]   have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.600]   that we make is in our gut.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.680]   And indeed, we have a lot of serotonin in our gut.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   But here's the deal.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.280]   Most of the serotonin that impacts our mood
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.360]   and our mental state is not in our gut.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.460]   Most of it is in the neurons of the brain
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.800]   in an area called the raphe nucleus of the brain.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.240]   There are a few other locations too.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.440]   You can't have a discussion about serotonin
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.560]   without having a discussion about antidepressants
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   because during the late '80s and early '90s,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   there was this explosion in the number of prescription drugs
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.680]   that were released.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.240]   Things like, first one and most famous one is Prozac,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.680]   Zoloft, Paxil, a number of other ones
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.400]   that are so-called SSRI,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   Basically, those drugs work by preventing
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   the gobbling up of serotonin
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.800]   or reuptake of serotonin into neurons
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.760]   after it's been released,
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.960]   which leads to more serotonin overall,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.480]   which means to elevate serotonin.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.600]   And indeed, those drugs were and can be very useful
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.080]   for certain people to feel better in cases of depression
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.640]   and some other clinical disorders as well.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.480]   Not everyone responds well to them,
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.160]   as I'm sure you've all heard,
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.880]   and their side effect profile
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.760]   has effects like blunting affect.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.040]   It can make people feel kind of flat, kind of meh.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.800]   Many people adjust their serotonin
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.680]   by just eating more food,
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.560]   and carbohydrate-rich foods will increase serotonin.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.200]   I eat a relatively high-protein and moderate-fat,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.480]   zero-carb or low-carb meal at lunch
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.240]   and in the afternoon to stay alert
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.520]   because those foods tend to favor dopamine production,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.600]   acetylcholine production, epinephrine production,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.720]   and alertness.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.240]   My mood is generally pretty good most of the time.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.020]   And then as evening comes around
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.500]   and I'm concerned about sleep and a good night's sleep,
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.760]   not concerned in an anxious way,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.400]   but I want to get a good night's sleep,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.380]   I will ingest foods that promote serotonin release
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.700]   because they contain a lot of tryptophan.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.540]   So as you're seeing,
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.680]   this isn't really a discussion about nutrition per se.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.040]   This is a discussion about food which contains amino acids,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.720]   amino acids being the precursors to neuromodulators,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.600]   and neuromodulators having a profound effect
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.640]   on your overall state of alertness or calmness,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.800]   happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.960]   So now you understand the relationship, I hope,
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.480]   between foods and dopamine, foods and serotonin,
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.680]   and that they're both being communicated to the brain
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.000]   via the vagus, right?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   So let's talk a little bit more about things
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.600]   that we ingest in our body
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.320]   and then allow our body to inform our brain
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   to shift our mood.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.680]   But I don't think most people know this simple fact,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.700]   has a profound effect on depression.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.000]   First of all, in an experiment done in animals,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.200]   they found there's a model of learned helplessness
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.020]   in animals.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.080]   It's not very kind to the animals,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.920]   but they put rats or mice in a jar,
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   they let them swim,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.680]   and they'll swim, swim, swim to try and save their life,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.800]   and eventually they give up.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.720]   It's a learned helplessness.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.920]   They don't let them drown, they take them out.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.400]   Adjusting the omega-3, omega-6 ratio
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.880]   so that the omega-3s are higher
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.160]   led to less learned helplessness,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   meaning these animals would swim longer.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.940]   But that same study was essentially done in humans.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.120]   What they did is they took people
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.040]   who were clinically depressed, major depression, okay?
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.000]   Major depression is severe maladaptive state,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.340]   meaning it inhibits job, relationships, appetite,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.240]   all sorts of negative health effects.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   And they did a comparison of 1,000 milligrams a day of EPA.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.320]   So EPA is one of the elements
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.360]   that contains high levels of omega-3s
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   that's in things like fish oil,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.480]   but it wasn't 1,000 milligrams of fish oil,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.720]   it was 1,000 milligrams of EPA.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.200]   Compared that to 20 milligrams of fluoxetine,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.180]   which is Prozac,
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.460]   they found that they were equally effective
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.320]   in reducing depressive symptoms.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.520]   And what was really interesting in addition to that
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   is that the combination of 1,000 milligrams of EPA
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.440]   and fluoxetine had a synergistic effect
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.080]   in lowering depressive symptoms.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.420]   And now there are lots of studies.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.800]   If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.560]   or fish oil and depression,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.320]   you would find that there were a number
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.960]   of really impressive results
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.000]   showing that it's at least as effective
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.920]   as certain SSRIs, antidepressants, at these dosages.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.160]   And it can amplify or improve the effect of low dosages
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.000]   of some of these SSRIs.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   You can discuss it with your doctor and family
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.080]   and make the choices that are right for you.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.840]   Now, of course, I really want to emphasize something,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.360]   which is that no one compound
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.280]   or nutrient or supplement or drug
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.160]   or behavior for that matter
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.980]   is going to be the be-all end-all
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.420]   of shifting out of depression
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.400]   or improving one's mood or improving sleep.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.280]   You cannot expect to take a compound,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.660]   regardless of source or potency,
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.780]   and have it completely shift your experience of life
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.680]   without having to continue to engage
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.900]   in the proper behaviors, all the things we know,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.200]   proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.940]   Okay, so now let's turn to another aspect
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.840]   of the gut-brain relationship that will surprise you,
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.820]   in some cases might shock you,
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.500]   and that has some really cool and actionable biology.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   And that's the gut microbiome, probiotics, and prebiotics.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   So what's the deal with the gut microbiome
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.540]   and the gut-brain axis?
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.940]   Today, we've actually been talking a lot already
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.980]   about the gut-brain axis
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.100]   that has nothing to do with microbiomes.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.420]   We've been talking about this vagus nerve
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.620]   that connects, providing sensory information
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.060]   from the body to the brain,
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.800]   and then the brain also sends, in the same nerve,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.980]   motor information to control the motility, the gut,
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.120]   the heart rate, how fast we breathe,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.620]   and deployment of immune stuff.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.600]   But oftentimes, when we hear
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   about the gut-brain axis these days,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.940]   it's a discussion about the gut microbiome.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.900]   I'm very happy there's so much discussion
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.580]   about the gut microbiome.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.060]   I am somewhat dismayed and concerned
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.940]   that most of what I hear out there
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.220]   is either false or partially false.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.380]   So we're going to clear up some of the misconceptions,
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.900]   first by understanding the biology,
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.720]   and then we're going to talk
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.380]   about some of the actionable items.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.660]   It is true that we have a lot
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   of these little microorganisms living in our gut.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.180]   They're not there because they want to help us.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.440]   They don't have brains.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.220]   They are adaptive, however.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.340]   They try and find and create environments
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.940]   that make it easier for them to proliferate.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.140]   So they don't care about you and me,
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.440]   but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.020]   in order to make more of themselves.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.100]   The microbiota that live in us
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.240]   vary along the length of our digestive tract.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.540]   So we are one long tube for digestion,
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.420]   and inside of that tube is a mucosal lining.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.740]   And the conditions of that mucosal lining
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.740]   set a number of different things.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.940]   It sets the rate of our digestion
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.020]   and the quality of our digestion.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.260]   It sets, for instance, our immune system.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.860]   We're ingesting things all the time.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.660]   Think about air, bacteria, viruses,
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.580]   they're making their way into our gut.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.060]   And some of those bacteria live in the gut,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.180]   and some of those bacteria
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.220]   bias the mucosal lining in the gut,
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.920]   stomach and intestines,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.060]   to be more acidic or more basic
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.260]   so that they can make more of themselves,
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.140]   so they can replicate.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.380]   Now, some of those mucosal linings that they promote
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.620]   make us feel better.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.820]   They make us feel more alert.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.180]   They bolster our immune system,
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.940]   and others make us feel worse.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.880]   So first rule,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.740]   the microbiome isn't good or bad.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.860]   Some of these little bugs that live in us
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.020]   do bad things to us.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.540]   They make us feel worse.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.940]   They lower our immunity.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.260]   They affect us in negative ways.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.820]   Some of them make us feel better.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.380]   And they do that mainly by changing the conditions
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.100]   of our gut environment.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.300]   In addition to that,
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:26.140]   they do impact the neurotransmitters
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.780]   and the neurons that live in the gut
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.380]   and that signal up to the brain
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.380]   to impact things like dopamine and serotonin
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.700]   that we've been talking about previously.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.620]   So there's a vast world now
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.940]   devoted to trying to understand what sources of food,
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.700]   what kinds of foods are good or not good
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.060]   for the gut microbiome.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.700]   Here's a few things that I think you might find surprising.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.660]   First of all,
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.760]   supporting a healthy gut microbiome is good for mood,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.220]   great for digestion,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.020]   and great for immune system function.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.740]   However, that does not mean maxing out
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.760]   or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.660]   that you can possibly manage.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.220]   As I mentioned many times before,
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.900]   I do believe in probiotics.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   I take probiotics.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.420]   But there are studies that show
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.800]   that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.220]   like lactobacillus and you really ramp up the levels more,
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.500]   it is not a case of more is better.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.620]   There are things like brain fog that can come from that.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.860]   Brain fog is just this inability to focus.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.400]   People feel really not well generally.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   Some of those studies are a little bit controversial,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.100]   but I think it's fair to say
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.380]   that if people really increase the amount of probiotic
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.940]   that they're taking beyond a certain amount,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.900]   then they start feeling foggy in the mind.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.260]   The ingestion of fermented foods
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.680]   is one of the best ways to support healthy levels
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.860]   of gut microbiota without exceeding the threshold
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.940]   that would cause things like brain fog.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.660]   So much so that some people report
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.220]   that when they start eating small bits,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.420]   'cause it doesn't require a lot of fermented foods,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.860]   that their overall mood is better,
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.340]   not unlike the effects of EPA,
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.020]   although I don't think it's been looked at directly
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.460]   in the context of clinical depression yet.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.600]   There are some things that you can do
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.940]   to really damage your gut microbiome.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.260]   And this is where there's a huge misconception
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.900]   that I want to clear up.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.900]   There was a study that showed that artificial sweeteners,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.440]   but a particular artificial sweetener, which was saccharin,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.660]   can disrupt the gut microbiome
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.060]   in ways that is detrimental
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.100]   to a number of different health markers,
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.500]   increasing inflammatory cytokines
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.700]   and all the other bad things that happen
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.980]   when the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.140]   Saccharin is not the most typical artificial sweetener
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.980]   that's used.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.380]   The most typical artificial sweeteners that are used
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.940]   are things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.420]   or sucralose, or these days Stevia.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.980]   To my knowledge, the negative effects
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.100]   of artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.380]   were restricted to saccharin.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.020]   So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.020]   in particular saccharin, disrupt the microbiome
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.880]   and make the environment within the gut,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   that mucosal lining, more favorable to bacteria microbiota
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.820]   that are not good for the organism.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.020]   Okay, this is an important distinction.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.500]   It's not just that a language thing where people say,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.660]   "Oh, you know, it kills the microbiome."
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.060]   It doesn't kill the microbiome, it shifts the microbiome.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.100]   And shifts in the microbiome can be good or they can be bad.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.220]   And that takes us to another topic
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.640]   that's a bit of a hot button topic,
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.540]   but I'm willing to go there
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.840]   'cause I think it deserves conversation,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.380]   which is nowadays there are many examples out there
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.380]   where people have switched from a kind of standard diet
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.380]   or even a vegetarian diet or vegan diet to a keto diet.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.140]   Now, keto doesn't necessarily have to mean
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.140]   the ingestion of meats, but it can.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.860]   And they experience positive effects for themselves.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.820]   But the ketogenic diet is interesting
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.340]   because when one shifts to the ketogenic diet,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.180]   there is a shift in the gut microbiome
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.040]   and some people end up feeling better.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.260]   Some people end up feeling worse.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.740]   Likewise, some people go from ingesting animal products,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.360]   including meat or they're vegetarian and they go to vegan,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.980]   and they experience positive shifts in mood and affect.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.300]   So the point of all this is that
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.380]   when I say you have to find what's right for you,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.340]   that's not a throwaway statement.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.380]   Some people's microbiome and the mucosal lining
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.860]   of their throat, of their gut, of their nose,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.220]   everything is improved by diets that are heavily meat-based
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.340]   and don't have many plants.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.140]   Other people do much better on a plant-based diet
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.340]   without many meat products or animal products.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.740]   It's highly individual.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.520]   And this probably has roots in genetic makeup.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.320]   This probably has roots in what people were raised on.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.760]   Because remember, the nervous system, of course,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.440]   is set up by your genes, your genetic program,
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.600]   but your nervous system,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.140]   it adapts early in life to your conditions.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.000]   That's what it's for.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.280]   The reason you have a nervous system
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.480]   is to move your body appropriately
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.680]   towards things that are good for you
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.940]   and away from things that are not.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.240]   But also it was designed to adapt.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   So that, yes, indeed, some people may like certain foods
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.820]   and react to certain foods better than others
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.940]   because of the way that their nervous system was wired,
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.140]   this enteric, as it's called, nervous system
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.980]   that lines the gut and that communicates with the brain.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.740]   So most of what I've talked about today
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.220]   is black and white.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.820]   These are things that are present in all of us,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.220]   the sugar-sensing neurons of the gut,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.920]   the way the vagus is wired,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.740]   the fact that omega-3, omega-6 tend to improve,
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.660]   the ratios tend to impact mood
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.900]   with high omega-3, omega-6 ratios improving mood.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.260]   We talked about all sorts of things
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.760]   in the gut-brain and body-brain axis,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.000]   but when it comes to the microbiome,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.400]   the key thing is that we all have a microbiome.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.880]   You want a microbiome,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.360]   but you want to promote the microbiome
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   that is right for you.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.760]   And that can be shifted and steered
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.840]   by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.280]   It's very clear that these fermented foods
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.880]   support the microbiome,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.480]   that we should be ingesting at least two servings per day,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.100]   which is quite a lot,
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.600]   that supplementation at low levels can be good.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   Supplementation at high levels can create this brain fog,
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.080]   even though some people say that result is controversial.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.360]   I've experienced this myself,
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.920]   and the data look to me pretty darn solid.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.400]   So that's one thing to think about as well.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.320]   And the other thing about the gut microbiome
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.000]   is that it's highly contextual
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.540]   based on other things that you're doing.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.080]   So even things like exercise
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.020]   and social wellbeing and connection,
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.120]   those things are also impacting the gut microbiome.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   So find the diet that's right for you
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.400]   and that works for you in the context of the other
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.240]   ethical and lifestyle choices that are important to you.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.260]   That's my advice.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.200]   So as we round up,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.480]   I want to share some results with you
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.640]   that without question will impact the way
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.280]   that you respond to food mentally and even physically.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.320]   I have a colleague at Stanford,
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.800]   Aaliyah Crum, who's done some remarkable experiments
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   on mindset, two that are particularly interesting to me
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.900]   I want to share with you now,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.260]   because they really emphasize how our beliefs
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.520]   can really impact the way
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.740]   that our brain and body work together.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.260]   I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.280]   where they had two groups of individuals.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.940]   They were each given a milkshake,
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.020]   and they had some factors measured from their blood
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.460]   by an IV while they ingested the milkshake
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.520]   and then afterwards as well.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.940]   And one of the factors that they were looking at
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.900]   was something called ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.980]   Ghrelin is a peptide that increases with hunger.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.620]   So the longer you haven't eaten, the ghrelin goes up.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.260]   One group got a shake that they were told
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.380]   was a low calorie healthy shake.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.980]   The other group got a milkshake that they were told
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.180]   was the very decadent high calorie shake.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.820]   And what they found was that the high calorie shake
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.720]   had a much more robust effect on blunting ghrelin
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.520]   and reducing ghrelin.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   But the interesting thing you probably guessed already
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.360]   is that it was the exact same shake given to both groups.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   And this speaks to the so-called top-down mechanisms
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.600]   or modulation of our physiology.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.840]   In a previous episode about pain,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.960]   we talked about the effects of obsessive infatuation
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.920]   and love on pain responses and pain thresholds.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.300]   This is yet another example where beliefs
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.200]   or subjective feelings can impact physiology
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.340]   at the level of the periphery,
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.900]   because ghrelin is released in the periphery in the body.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.300]   And so this is not just the placebo effect,
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.700]   this is an incredible set of findings
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.300]   that illustrate the extent to which
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.180]   whether or not we believe a food is going to be good for us
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.900]   or not good for us.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.860]   These belief effects are not about lying to yourself.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.980]   So in order for them to work,
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.580]   you have to be naive to the information, right?
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.200]   You can't simply lie to yourself
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.640]   and tell yourself what you want to believe.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   And that's important,
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.820]   but also important is that the mind and the body
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.680]   are in this fascinating interplay.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.740]   And today we've talked mainly about how the body
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.960]   and things that we put inside this tube
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   that runs from our mouth to the other end,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.920]   to our rectum basically is impacting all these cells,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   these neurons, microbiota in their mucosal lining,
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.060]   heart, lungs, and how all that information
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.980]   is feeding up to the brain to impact how we feel up here.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.620]   But also how we feel up here is impacting
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.760]   how our body reacts at levels of very core physiology
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.740]   that you couldn't just tell yourself
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.780]   that this was going to work.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.980]   But what you believe about certain substances,
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.900]   certain foods, certain nutrients
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.140]   does have a profound effect on the magnitude of their impact
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.820]   and sometimes even the quality
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.920]   and direction of that impact.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.340]   So today's episode, we took a full journey
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.980]   into the brain-body relationship
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.820]   and discussed a lot of the mechanisms
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.540]   and the actionable items that you can approach
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.220]   if you want to explore this aspect
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.500]   of your biology and psychology further.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.660]   Last, but certainly not least,
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.340]   I want to thank everybody for your time and attention today.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.440]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.020]   [upbeat music]
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.600]   (upbeat music)
