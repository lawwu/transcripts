[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - I have a question about mentors.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   I'm a big believer in mentors,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.420]   either mentors that know us and we know them
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.540]   or people that we assign as mentors
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480]   without them realizing it, this sort of thing.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.580]   Do you have mentors at this stage of life
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.000]   for particular areas of life?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.580]   Are you mentoring yourself?
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.180]   Are you flying with a few voices in your head
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.380]   that serve you well?
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.600]   Who are your mentors?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.360]   - I definitely have people I consider mentors.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.080]   I think at this point, rarely one way
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.840]   in the sense that they tend to be friends
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.700]   I spend time with.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.100]   They get something from it, I get something from it.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.620]   Not in a transactional way,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180]   but they find it fun or beneficial or amusing,
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.500]   in some way redeeming to spend time with me.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.340]   That's the hope.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.460]   - But how is that different from traditional friendship,
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.060]   your sort of standard friendship?
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.220]   Are you spending time with some orientation
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.620]   toward their embodying areas of life
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.380]   that you would like to emulate?
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.460]   - Totally.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.380]   I spend time around people I hope to be more like,
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.020]   in some way.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.860]   Because guess what?
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.700]   You're going to average into, say,
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.300]   the sum, holistic whole of the five or six people
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.220]   you spend the most time with.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.580]   So you should choose that very carefully.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.420]   That includes virtual parasocial relationships.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.580]   Like, okay, if you're listening
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.460]   to a fill-in-the-blank person for four hours a week,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.380]   five hours a week, two hours a week,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.440]   whoever that group is comprised of
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.100]   is going to influence who you become.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   And for me, then, I think carefully about my friendships.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.220]   And they could be older, like Kevin Kelly
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.780]   who's become a good friend,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.140]   who has a wealth of life experience that I don't have.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.860]   And so I might just call him and say,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.020]   "Kevin, I have a question for you."
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.660]   But I do that with my younger friends, too.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.020]   And they could be younger than I am,
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.140]   and I might still view them as a mentor in X, Y, or Z.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.100]   I think mentor has a heavy weight to it.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.100]   It has a connotation of maybe never-ending,
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.460]   time-consuming obligation.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.900]   So I would never, for instance,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.020]   and I know a lot of people try this,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.220]   ask someone to be my mentor.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.040]   It's like, "Would you like to be
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380]   "my free life coach forever?"
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.220]   You know, it's like, (laughs)
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.500]   that's kind of how it sounds to the recipient.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.820]   - It sounds very formal.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.180]   - Yeah, it sounds very formal.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.260]   So for me, I would say there have certainly been mentors.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.140]   I've had wrestling coaches, I've had teachers,
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.820]   I've had resident advisors who are reverence,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.420]   who had a huge impact on my life,
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.620]   and followed up with me, and paid attention to me,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140]   and cared for me.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.140]   In more of a one-directional sense, right?
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860]   I view myself as the beneficiary.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.980]   Of course, they certainly got something out of it
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.820]   if they had that job.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.300]   I mean, they probably found it
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.540]   to be very gratifying in its own way.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.620]   And teachers like Professor Ed Hsiao at Princeton,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.260]   I feel incredibly indebted to.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.940]   These days, and for a long time,
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.340]   I've believed that you can learn something powerful
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.860]   from almost anyone, probably anyone you interact with.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.420]   Could be an Uber driver,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.660]   could be someone taking garbage out of a restaurant.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.500]   If you really take the time to dig, you can find something.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   And before you can, I think as an adult,
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.980]   effectively think about who you would like to learn from,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.060]   if I put it that way.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.660]   It's helpful to have a baseline of self-awareness
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.180]   so you know what you might want to work on
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.180]   to either amplify strengths,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.820]   develop skills, address weaknesses.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.740]   And so for instance, one of my close friends,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.980]   Matt Mullenweg, he's younger than I am.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.220]   He's the founder of Automatic, which runs WordPress.com.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.380]   He was the lead developer of WordPress,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.660]   although it was an open-source project,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.900]   of course, with many, many contributors.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.740]   He was one of the lead developers,
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.620]   now powers something like 32% of the internet.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.620]   And he exemplifies a cool and calm temperament,
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.060]   even in the most chaotic periods imaginable,
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.700]   during the most chaotic events imaginable.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   And when I find myself getting dysregulated,
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.020]   to use a fancy term, losing my shit,
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.580]   or getting carried away by emotion,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.180]   getting righteously angry, or whatever it might be,
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.780]   and I recognize at some point
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.620]   that it's really not serving me,
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.940]   that I am being owned by the emotion, right?
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.220]   Like I'm the dog on the leash, not the other way around.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.660]   Then I think of Matt.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.740]   I'm like, what would Matt do?
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.860]   What advice would Matt give me right now?
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.060]   How would Matt act in these circumstances?
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.820]   And I do that with many friends.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.660]   I also think a lot about,
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.300]   and this is borrowing from someone named Cathy Sierra,
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.900]   from a long time ago,
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.940]   focusing more on just-in-time information
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.100]   as opposed to just-in-case information.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.060]   So just-in-case information is like,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.220]   I'm gonna read these 20 books
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.460]   'cause in two years I might be interested in X, Y, and Z.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.060]   That, I think, is often a waste of time
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.860]   because if it ever becomes relevant,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.940]   you're just gonna have to reread those books.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.220]   People do the same thing with humans.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.580]   They're like, I wanna meet so-and-so
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.980]   and have them as my mentor
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.140]   because maybe five years from now,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.380]   I'll do X, Y, and Z,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.860]   and then they'll be useful for ABC.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.180]   That's too speculative.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.380]   And I think it ends up in a lot of wasted energy.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.420]   So the podcast, for me,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.180]   writing the books and doing the interviews,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.940]   even prior to the podcast,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.820]   becoming involved with startups,
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.220]   delving into the world of science and scientists,
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.860]   all helps me to develop a confidence
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.860]   that almost any question I could ask,
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.820]   I can find some semblance of an answer for
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.580]   by just reaching out to a few people and saying,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.820]   who do you know who might be able to answer this?
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.940]   And that's very reassuring,
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.380]   and it relieves some of the anxiety or pressure
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.900]   that people might feel
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.260]   to assemble some personal board of directors
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.860]   of X-men and women who can help them with everything.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.780]   And then there are people I hire to be accountable to.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   So I might work with coaches, therapists, and so on,
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.620]   who I would view as mentors.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.540]   They just happen to get paid for it.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.660]   (laughs)
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.880]   (upbeat music)
