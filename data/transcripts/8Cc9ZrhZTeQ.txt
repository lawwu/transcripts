[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Several of our most astute
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.720]   Ask Pastor John podcast listeners
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.280]   picked up on your podcast reference
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.800]   in the John MacArthur episode, episode 214.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.400]   David, one such astute listener, asks this.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.360]   I'm curious to know what other podcasts
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.840]   you subscribe to using your Downcast app.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.360]   So Pastor John, what podcasts do you listen to?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.960]   - Okay, so I just got out my phone here.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.760]   Let me get it.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   And I click on the app called Downcast.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.440]   And I'll read you my top, here's at the top.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.780]   These are the ones that are unplayed.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.960]   'Cause that's what comes first in the list.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.520]   Okay, there's albertmuller.com in the briefing.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.840]   Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960]   (laughing)
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.280]   No, I don't listen to it very often,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.840]   but sometimes I check and see how you do these things.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.320]   The next one is Bethlehem Baptist Sermons.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.000]   That's Jason, my successor,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.900]   and I love to listen to Jason preach.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.980]   The next one is Brookhills Audio.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.720]   So that's David Platt's sermons.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.880]   The next one is Cannon Wired.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.280]   That's sermons from Doug Wilson.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   The next one is Sinclair B. Ferguson Sermon Audio.com.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   The next one is the Gospel Coalition podcast.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.800]   The next one is Grace to You, pulpit podcast.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.280]   That's John MacArthur.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.400]   The next one is Poem of the Day.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.240]   They just put up a different poem every day
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.940]   from poetry.com or wherever it comes from
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.600]   to give me a taste of poetry
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.560]   whenever I choose to listen to those.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   The next one is Renewing Your Mind with R.C. Sproul.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.360]   The next one is sermons,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.680]   University Reform Church of Lansing.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.200]   That's Kevin DeYoung.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.720]   And then comes Theology Refresh from Desiring God.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   Then comes Truth for Life broadcast, Alistair Begg.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.440]   And here's the ones that are empty.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.480]   C.S. Lewis Review podcast.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240]   They hardly ever put anything up,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.720]   but they did for a while.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.800]   Carl F. Henry Center for Theological,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.300]   it's a dot, dot, dot, I can't even finish,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.800]   but it's a podcast from Trinity
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   from the Carl F. H. Henry Center.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680]   Desiring God Authors Online is there.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.280]   Let's see, that's probably enough.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   The rest of them are kind of really weird poetry things
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.000]   that never get posted to anymore.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.680]   So those are the ones that are there,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.920]   but here's something just as important.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.280]   I follow about 100 people on Twitter.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640]   One of my goals in following people on Twitter
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600]   is that I try to choose enough people
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   who are discerning that they are constantly feeding me
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   the best articles, audio, video.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   And so when I find a tweet,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.520]   like say somebody says,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.080]   "Don Carson on the relationship
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.800]   "between the Great Commission and the Second Coming."
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.620]   Okay, I say, "Oh, I wanna hear what Don has to say
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.600]   "about that, 'cause cross-conference is coming up."
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.720]   And so I email myself that tweet.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   'Cause right then, I don't have time.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   You know, I'm just going somewhere or doing something,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.260]   I don't have time to listen to this now.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.980]   So I click and I email myself that tweet,
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.220]   and later, when I have time,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.520]   and if I have time, I don't watch all of them,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560]   I'll just click through to that and watch it.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   So Twitter is as important to me as a podcast feeder,
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.100]   because it's broader,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.780]   and I can't choose everything that's out there.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.000]   And it would be important for people to know how I do this,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.920]   'cause I don't have a lot of time to listen to stuff.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.440]   I run outside three mornings a week.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.920]   So that's about, given the run and the cool down,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.000]   that's about a 45-minute block of time.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So I can listen to three times 45 minutes,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.760]   usually in a week, just by jogging.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   Then on the off days, I might do some calisthenics
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.820]   or something that don't take as much time,
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.660]   and listen to a 10-minute something or other
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.500]   in my exercise time.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.900]   Now, what's the point of all this?
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.380]   I tried to think through, why do I do this?
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.000]   Isn't this a waste of time?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.920]   Aren't you being jerked around by the media?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.260]   Here's my three answers.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.760]   Number one, I need reminders of what I know
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.900]   and have forgotten about God and the Bible.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.320]   Because Peter said,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.240]   Peter said in 2 Peter 1:13,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.000]   "I think it is right, as long as I'm in this body,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.160]   to stir you up by way of reminder."
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.400]   Well, amen, Peter.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.040]   John Piper leaks, you know?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.240]   He just forgets.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.920]   And I need for a preacher, and it can be any preacher,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.480]   to tell me what I know, and to tell me what I know
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.400]   with some sense of reality and authenticity.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   And that leads to number two.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.360]   I need real, live people speaking to me
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.640]   about their experience with God.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800]   This is what the Psalms are, aren't they?
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   I mean, the Psalms say things like,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.480]   "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.720]   There is nothing on earth I desire besides you.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.000]   My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   but God is the strength of my heart."
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.880]   That's a man talking to me about his walk with God.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.280]   And I'm listening to him, and I'm saying,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.320]   "Yes, yes, please, God, I want that."
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.880]   So I want people to do that for me.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   I wanna listen to pastors who've walked with God.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.360]   I don't want them only to tell me what they've seen.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   I want them to tell me what they're savoring.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.600]   Talk to me about what you're experiencing of God,
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.360]   because I get stirred up that way,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.880]   and I wanna join you in that experience.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   So that's my second incentive
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.520]   in going after some of these videos and audios.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.300]   And the third thing is, I need to learn.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.280]   Second Peter also says,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   "Grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus."
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.840]   And if you say to me, "Well, read a book, you know,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.920]   and you'll learn."
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.020]   I say, "Well, I can't read while I'm jogging,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.360]   thank you very much, and I can't read while I'm driving."
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   So I'm basically, I'm trying to obey Ephesians 5:16, right?
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.480]   Redeem the time for the days are evil.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.680]   Redeem the kairos for the days of evil.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.280]   And redeem there is purchase it, grab it, don't waste it.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   God has given us technology as a way of redeeming time.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.400]   And isn't it sad, Tony,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.480]   that so many have turned it into a time waster?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   So my closing exhortation to myself and to everybody is,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.320]   use your phone or your iPod or whatever you got,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   use it as a time redeemer, not a time waster.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.880]   - Amen, well, it sounds like I need to get to work
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.440]   and record some new authors on the line podcast
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.400]   for your playlist.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
