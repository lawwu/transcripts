[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Happy Thanksgiving, everyone,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.760]   or I guess technically it's a happy Thanksgiving Eve.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.880]   On this holiday built around gratitude,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.400]   we can learn a lot from the Apostle Paul,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.260]   a man who loved to celebrate God's grace
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980]   and others with heartfelt thanks.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.280]   And as we've seen several times in this podcast,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.400]   Paul says learning to speak thanks
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080]   is what cleans up the mouth.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.440]   It cleans it up from using crude and vulgar language.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.480]   Thanksgiving has this powerful cleansing effect
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.520]   on our lives and what comes out of our mouths.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.520]   And Paul's life itself models this gratitude.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.340]   He mentions thanks about 50 times in his epistles,
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.920]   leading to one of my favorite quotes,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.960]   acclaimed by New Testament scholar, David Powell,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.840]   who once wrote, "The Apostle Paul mentions the subject
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.300]   "of thanksgiving more frequently per page
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.300]   "than any other Hellenistic author, pagan or Christian."
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.440]   Wow, that's a high claim.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.120]   But it's a claim that explains a text
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.840]   like 2 Thessalonians 2, verses 13 to 14,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   where Paul writes this,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.580]   "But we ought always to give thanks to God
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760]   "for you, brothers, beloved by the Lord."
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.700]   Why?
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.620]   "Because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.000]   "through sanctification by the Spirit
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.800]   "and belief in the truth.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.680]   "To this he called you through our gospel
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.140]   "so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   Great text.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.580]   In this text, we see four truths
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.300]   that motivate our thanksgiving.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.180]   Here's Pastor John at the end of 2001
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.580]   in a sermon to explain.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.740]   - The first one is found in 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 13.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.340]   Paul says, "We should always give thanks
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.420]   "to God for you, brethren."
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.860]   Now notice, that's prayer.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.580]   Prayer is in the form of thanks.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580]   He says, "We should do this," so it's a duty.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.540]   Should, duty, should.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.420]   However, it's the kind of duty
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.940]   so that if you experience it as burden,
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.560]   you haven't experienced it yet.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.820]   If you experience gratitude as a burden,
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.220]   you don't know gratitude.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.560]   Because true gratitude is not an exertion of the will,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.460]   it's an overflow of a sense of being treated
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.500]   better than you deserve.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.720]   A kid who gets black socks for Christmas
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.020]   from his grandmother when he wanted a firetruck
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.380]   might be told by his mother,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.660]   "Say thank you to your grandmother."
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.460]   And he might say, "Thank you, grandmother, for my socks."
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.340]   He does not experience gratitude at that moment.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.460]   The words thank you are a burden and a duty,
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.140]   and it feels like hypocrisy for one simple reason,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.700]   the emotion is not there.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.540]   However, had he opened the firetruck,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.780]   maybe that's coming next, grandmother's not dumb,
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.740]   opens the box, firetruck, "Oh, yes, woo-hoo!
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.300]   "Thank you, grandma!"
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.360]   That's not a burden.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.740]   That's not a burden.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.420]   You don't know gratitude yet
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.940]   if this should here lands on you like law.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.020]   You need to know Him.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.620]   You need to come to the end of this year
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.460]   and look back over this year with all of his horror
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.100]   and feel something really freeing
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.620]   about how good He's been to you,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.040]   way better than you deserve and me.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.100]   So it's a duty here, but look where it comes from.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.260]   Look where gratitude comes from in verse 14.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.220]   When he says, "We should always give thanks to God for you."
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.540]   So here is a prayer happening called thanks,
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.980]   but where does it come from?
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.980]   It comes from four reasons,
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.860]   which come from knowledge, which come from the Word
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.180]   about how God saved the Thessalonians.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.020]   Number one, you are beloved by the Lord.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.780]   Number two, verse 13 at the end,
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.300]   "God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.100]   through sanctification by the Spirit and faith."
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.120]   Number three, the beginning of verse 14,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.700]   "He called you through our gospel."
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.460]   Number four, "The aim of this call was that you may obtain
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.240]   the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.820]   You see where his thanks is coming from?
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.180]   God loved them, God chose them, God called them,
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.540]   God will glorify them.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.340]   That's what he knows in his head
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.140]   and it produces the emotion of,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.380]   "Oh God, how good you've been to the Thessalonians."
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.180]   Just bubbles up.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.820]   Look what you have done for the Thessalonian church.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.940]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.780]   That's the way I feel about Bethlehem
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.100]   over and over again for reason after reason.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.460]   But there gotta be reasons.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.980]   Why?
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.100]   So that that will get the glory.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.260]   God will get the glory, not the Thessalonians.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.380]   God has chosen you, God has called you,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.420]   God is gonna glorify you, God loved you.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.580]   Praise God, thank God for you.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.260]   And if you need to see where I got
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.100]   the essential structure of this sermon,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.340]   look at verse 13 and notice the word spirit
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.380]   and the word truth.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.460]   God saves us, it says, "Through sanctification
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.380]   by the spirit and faith in the truth."
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.740]   Now there you have spirit and truth,
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.860]   spirit and truth, spirit and word brought together.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.460]   How do you get changed?
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.820]   How do you get changed?
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.860]   Everybody in this room needs to change.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.060]   Oughta wanna change.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.540]   More like Jesus, more like Jesus.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.980]   More affections like him, more behavior like him,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.740]   more attitudes like him, more change.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.820]   Oh, make 2002, change city.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.940]   How's that gonna happen?
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.940]   Answer, spirit and truth, spirit and truth.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.300]   And prayer corresponds to our reliance upon the spirit
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.540]   and meditation corresponds to our faith in the truth
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.380]   and so we will bring the two together.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.780]   - So good, this clip is from a sermon preached
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.700]   on December 30th, 2001 titled,
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.940]   "Hold fast to the word and pray for us,
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.660]   how the spirit and the word produce change."
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.780]   The full sermon is online at DG right now.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.500]   It's a fitting clip as we enter the Thanksgiving holiday
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.740]   here in the States.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.940]   Every day was Thanksgiving Day for Paul, I suppose.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.460]   And speaking of thankfulness,
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.060]   thank you for listening to the podcast
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.420]   and engaging with it over the years.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.140]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.260]   So on behalf of John Piper,
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.340]   we pray that you would enjoy a wonderful day of gratitude,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.060]   of celebrating God's grace in your life
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.300]   and in the lives of those around you.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.300]   Pastor John and I are back in the studio on Friday.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.200]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.360]   (upbeat music)
