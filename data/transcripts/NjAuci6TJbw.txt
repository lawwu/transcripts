[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.080]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.480]   where each week our inbox fills up
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.120]   with more and more questions
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   from our extremely intelligent audience.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   Duncan, I'm always pleasantly surprised
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   with the breadth and depth of the questions we receive.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.300]   Today's show presented by Tropical Bros.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.400]   I love Tropical Bros.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.760]   Been wearing the shirts for years.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.980]   I always get a comment from someone when I'm wearing it.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.840]   People love these shirts.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.720]   It's the designs, the material, the look, the comfort.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.800]   If you're coming to Future Proof,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.680]   you have to get one of these.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.960]   It's the shirt everyone will be wearing, including me,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   because we'll be on the beach, it'll be hot.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.460]   Duncan will have one, John will have one, Michael will have one.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.560]   If you're not coming to Future Proof,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.960]   pick one up in time for Labor Day.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.200]   And we still have, what, three sizes for Animal Spirits,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   Tropical Bros. collab?
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   - I believe that's right.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.680]   - I think we have XL, XX, and XXX, right?
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.880]   No more larges for Michael.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.480]   We'll link to that one in the show notes.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.080]   The other thing is, they don't just have Hawaiian shirts.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.040]   These quarter zips are amazing when it gets cold.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.360]   It's 60 degrees here in Michigan today.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   And also the polo shirts.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.540]   I love the polos.
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.800]   - Wow, look at you, doubled up with the Tropical Bros?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.200]   - Yeah, it goes well.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.140]   This is like, I don't want, I'm wearing long sleeves,
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.080]   but it's still a summer shirt,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   'cause it's got the pineapples on it.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.880]   They got a few new designs, too.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.920]   I'm gonna have to pick up another one of those.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.240]   Go to tropicalbros.com for more.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.600]   All right. - Do it.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.480]   - Let's do a question.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.680]   - Okay, so before we get started,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.840]   I actually, I wanted to take a moment
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440]   for a little happy birthday.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.520]   It's Ben's birthday, everyone.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.440]   - Thank you.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   - So let's switch this way out.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.480]   So yeah, everyone's here to say happy birthday.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.620]   (cheering)
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.880]   - Hey, thanks, guys.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.120]   (cheering)
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.440]   - Happy birthday. - Much appreciated.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   All right.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040]   - All right, get out of here.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   Be quiet.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740]   Cool, but yeah, for real, happy birthday.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.580]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.960]   They, I was just having a conversation with someone.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.800]   At a certain point, they lose their luster a little bit.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400]   I used to be a big birthday guy,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.240]   but you know, this is being a human being, I guess.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.720]   - Just another day now, right?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880]   - Let's do it, yep, hi.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.640]   - All right, up first.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.480]   - I do wanna say,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.300]   I always talk about how I never get carded at the store,
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.520]   because I have three, but I have, you know,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.960]   or I used to get carded all the time,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.680]   and now I have three kids, I still get carded.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.440]   And I bought some booze last weekend,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   some beer, Coronalite something,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   and the lady looks at my ID and she goes,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.080]   "You're probably, what, 20 years from being 21?"
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.000]   And I'm like, "Yes, I am.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.800]   "You didn't need to say it like that.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680]   "She nailed it."
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.640]   All right.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.240]   - That's rough.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.480]   - I must be looking old, all right.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.340]   - Up first, we have a question from Xerxes, Xerxes?
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.180]   - Xerxes.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.680]   - Oh, Xerxes, okay, there we go.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.480]   This is a difficult question to ask.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.320]   My wife and I make about $220,000 combined
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   and max out our 401(k) and 457(b),
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.320]   and she'll get a pension if she stays
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.160]   in the job for eight years.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.800]   We're both 40 and have a three-year-old daughter.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.160]   Expensive, he has in parentheses.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.760]   My parents are 72 and 70 and have a net worth
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400]   of over $4 million.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.720]   They're both fit, and of course,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.600]   I want them to live a long, healthy life,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.000]   and we have a wonderful relationship.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.080]   But purely mathematically speaking,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.520]   how much can I expect to inherit?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.480]   They are retired but relatively frugal,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.220]   and I'm an only child.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.160]   - I think Xerxes was like some Persian ruler
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.280]   back in the day, do you remember that from history?
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   - I remember a South Park or something, I think.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.200]   Loaded question here, but I like it.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.720]   I heard a quote somewhere that said like,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   you know you're winning in life
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.160]   if you're asking uncomfortable questions from time to time.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.920]   So this is definitely an uncomfortable question,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.240]   but death and taxes, right?
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.480]   We can't outrun it.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.680]   So it feels weird to even ask it.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.040]   Fortune had this article a couple weeks ago
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.280]   that pegged the wealth transfer from boomers
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.240]   to millennials at $73 trillion until 2045.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.620]   An additional 12 trillion will go to charity, they said.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.200]   So how much can people plan to get?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.960]   I found some research from University of Pennsylvania,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.180]   researchers, they looked at inheritance
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.100]   by age and income groups.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.120]   John, let's do a chart on for the first one.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.760]   This is average inheritance received by age
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.780]   and then income group, and it breaks it down by,
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.120]   you can see here, the average is pretty tiny.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.480]   It's probably in the five to $10,000 range
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   for everyone who's below the 5%.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.660]   If you're in the top 5%, by wealth, it's more,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.700]   it's a little higher, closer to $50,000,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.080]   but it's probably lower than most people would think.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.360]   And interestingly enough, based on the research,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   it's only something like one of the 10 people
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.200]   actually receiving inheritance.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.720]   Most people, I guess, spend it down or don't save enough.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.600]   So unfortunately, this is a situation
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.080]   where the rich stay rich by just passing along their money.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.240]   So one of my least favorite stock market inequality stats
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.000]   is that the top 10% owns like 90% of the stock market.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.400]   The inheritance picture looks the same.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.000]   So households in the top 5% of the income distribution
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.980]   receive inheritances that are like four to 12 times larger
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.240]   than households in the bottom 80%.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.440]   So basically this high net worth
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.400]   and high alternate net worth.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.280]   I think people with $5 million and up
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.540]   make up like 1.5% of all households,
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.040]   but they constitute 42% of the volume of money
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.580]   that's gonna be passed down.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.480]   So John, do the next chart on here.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.600]   This next graphic shows the people
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.800]   who actually get an inheritance, what is their average?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.120]   So taking out all those people who don't get one.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   And now we see the bottom 90% get something
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.680]   between 90 and 100 to 60,000.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.440]   The top 5%, it's more like $425,000.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.680]   But look at where most of the money
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.000]   gets handed down, Duncan.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.520]   They break the age group here.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.480]   You're 66 to 75 years old.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.300]   That's when you get it
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.440]   because people are living longer, right?
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.080]   So I think the stat is that a couple today
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.060]   that retires today faces a 50% chance
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.400]   of at least one of the people living to their mid 90s.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.480]   So people living longer,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.280]   that means that inheritance when you get it,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.640]   it's not gonna come that soon.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.020]   So I think, when do you need money,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.560]   especially this person asking,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   right now they have a young child.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.320]   They probably have a mortgage, saving for retirement,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.600]   saving for college, emergencies, daycare, all that stuff.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.440]   It's a lot.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.520]   So I think obviously the amount you're gonna receive
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.060]   depends on how long your parents live
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.400]   and what financial market returns are gonna be,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.580]   how much they spend, all this stuff.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.760]   And you just don't know how, all this stuff.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.160]   But with $4 million in the early 70s,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.480]   I'm guessing you're gonna receive a pretty healthy chunk,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   especially since you're an only child.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.080]   I do think if there were multiple siblings here,
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.480]   it'd be a little trickier.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.760]   But since you are an only child,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.320]   and obviously you know how much your parents are worth,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.100]   unless you're just checking statements
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.440]   when they're not looking,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.380]   you guys have talked finances, which is a good thing.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.400]   So I would ask them about this,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.560]   ask about their retirement plans,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.360]   talk to them about the finances and let them know,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   it can be expensive to raise a family
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.720]   and talk about maybe having some of that inheritance come
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.520]   while they're still alive so they can watch you enjoy it
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   and watch their grandchild enjoy it.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880]   And so I think it's at least worth asking what the plan is.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.200]   So you kind of, I guess one of the questions here would be,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   if I'm gonna receive a big chunk at some point in my life,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.600]   do I need to save less for retirement
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.160]   and these sorts of things so I can spend more now?
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.760]   So I don't think you make it all about you.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.680]   I think you wanna tell them you want to enjoy it with them,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.880]   maybe take some trips,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.580]   help save for 529 for the grandkid, whatever it is.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.000]   That way you don't have to wait for it
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.620]   until you're 60s or 70s or whatever.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.560]   It's certainly a morbid conversation to have,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.120]   but I think it's worthwhile to get a sense of their plans
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.200]   and see what, it'll help you plan better as well.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.920]   - Yeah, and just don't piss them off.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.480]   You don't want them going and weaving it to the cat
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.560]   or something like that.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.920]   - Yes, the human fund, yeah.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   No, in my family, we're worried that my dad
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.920]   is gonna leave it all in the name of his dog
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.720]   because we're pretty sure he loves her more than us,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.000]   but him more than us, but yes.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.960]   - I mean, dogs are my favorite people.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.800]   - That's true.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200]   So yeah, a weird, I love how they preface this
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.520]   with like it's a hard thing to have,
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.040]   but like, yeah, I mean, if you wanna just get it out
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   in the open, it could be bizarre or awkward,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.120]   but I think you just do it.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.960]   Rip the van down.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.760]   - What do you think though about this
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.840]   versus the like surprise scenario?
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.440]   Because the surprise is like, you're sad about the deaths,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.040]   but then that's like some consolation.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.880]   Like, oh wow, look, there's a surprise windfall
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.720]   of a bunch of money.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.680]   - Okay, yeah, again, another morbid kind of thought,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.800]   but sure, this is what happens.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.920]   We cannot run it, right?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   - You're hedging, you know, emotional hedging.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.120]   - Just be happy that your parents
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.620]   aren't the Brian Johnson guy who's trying to live to 150.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.460]   Right?
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.300]   - Sure, sure.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.460]   - Got that going for you.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.620]   All right, next question.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.700]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Scott.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.300]   You've discussed Canadians that are looking down a barrel
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.700]   to a much higher interest rate
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.300]   once their mortgage comes up.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.140]   Unfortunately, I'm one of them.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.740]   I'm currently locked into a 1.6% rate
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.460]   for another three and a half years.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.260]   My concern is that when we renew,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.860]   our rate will be much higher.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.900]   My wife and I have been debating the merits
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.220]   of using this time to aggressively pay down the mortgage
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.460]   so we have a smaller mortgage to renew
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.180]   or saving the difference to give ourselves a cushion
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.740]   once that time comes.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.660]   We're in a fortunate situation
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.340]   and we'll be all right either way,
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.060]   but just trying to see how we can put ourselves
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.300]   in the best position.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.260]   Any thoughts or insights would be greatly appreciated.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.720]   - We have a geographical diverse audience here
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.660]   at the compound, right?
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.540]   We receive questions all the time from people who say,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.580]   geez, the mortgage market you're describing
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.700]   in the United States is nothing like we have here.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.540]   And so people are always either confused
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.060]   or maybe a little jealous because the fact
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.660]   that we have 15 and 30 year fixed rate mortgages here
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.500]   is pretty rare.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.020]   So John, do a chart on here.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   This just shows the number of mortgages
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.380]   by variable and fixed rates.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.420]   You can see countries like Norway and Australia
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.300]   and Canada and Sweden and Finland
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.540]   are way more vulnerable to changes in rates
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.580]   because they have variable rates.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.940]   And this was a great thing for the past,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.180]   I don't know, 20 or 30 years
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.140]   because you would lock something in.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.180]   These variable rate mortgages had five-year terms
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.380]   and then your rate would go down
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.580]   and then it'd go down again the next term.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.260]   So it was a great thing until now
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.540]   that people are looking, again, looking down the barrel,
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.540]   as they said.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.860]   So I think a lot of these European, Canadian,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.140]   Australian listeners are like, what am I gonna do?
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.780]   They see this train coming, right?
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.860]   They know their rate is gonna reset.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.420]   I never really knew how this all worked
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.380]   until a Canadian listener sent me an article
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.540]   that explains how the resets work.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.580]   So they basically have two types of variable mortgages.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.700]   One of them is like you would think
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   it's an adjustable rate mortgage.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.140]   It changes, your payment goes up.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.620]   But another one is called
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.460]   in a variable fixed amount mortgage
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.060]   where your payment stays the same
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.180]   but the amortization period gets longer.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.540]   So essentially you're paying a more towards interest
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.300]   when your rate goes up and less towards principal,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.700]   like essentially extending the loan.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.260]   So it would go from like a 30-year loan
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.020]   to like a 45-year loan or something
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.820]   because you're paying back lower principal amounts.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.180]   I don't know how many people actually have these,
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.460]   but learning, reading about this kind of blew my mind.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.500]   It's that the payment doesn't change,
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.680]   but you'd be paying it off.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   So obviously, you have five years.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.740]   And so you know if you got one of these teaser rates
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.940]   that was effectively low,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.780]   and I guess it's not a teaser rate,
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.300]   it's just what the market rates are.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.860]   I did a quick Google search
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.820]   and Canadian mortgage rates now around 7%,
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.500]   which is pretty similar to United States.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.700]   So for years I've been telling people
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.860]   to avoid paying off that 3% mortgages.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.180]   Well, this is a whole totally different ballgame, right?
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.780]   So Scott has a much higher hurdle right now
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.880]   with his Canadian mortgage.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.380]   He's seeing it coming down.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.500]   I guess the only question I have
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.040]   is can you do a big principal pay down at renewal?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.140]   So when this renewal happens in a year or two,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140]   can you just do it all at once?
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.820]   So you can save now and earn some interest at least
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.380]   on those higher short-term savings rates.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.540]   So you're not paying it down sequentially.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.660]   I think you can pay it off all in one big fell swoop,
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.180]   I think.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.740]   So the math should be pretty easy to figure out
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.980]   in terms of like how much you pay down
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.100]   and how that impact your payment
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.480]   and any amortization and interest.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.100]   I have no problem making this priority.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.100]   7% rates, I think that's a good idea
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   at the time of renewal to pay it down a little bit
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.380]   and try to keep your payoff steady or your payment steady.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.660]   I would love to hear how many people
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.540]   actually have these variable amount mortgages,
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.280]   but yeah, I do consider us lucky to have 30-year fixed rates
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.700]   because it's not like that in every country.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.860]   - Do you think that at some point,
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.140]   you guys have talked about this before,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.100]   but do you think at some point
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.100]   we'll have traveling mortgages?
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.260]   Or I don't know the way to state it,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.760]   but where it stays with the house
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.940]   so like you can move into the previous owner's mortgage?
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.420]   - The longer rates stay higher,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.180]   the higher the likelihood of that happening.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.740]   I think some bank trying it, right?
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.580]   I don't know how they would do it
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.220]   if you pay some sort of upfront fee,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.260]   but it would make sense to just sort of loosen up things up
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   and add more supply to the market
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.680]   because yeah, those loan departments there,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.420]   it's gotta be tumbleweeds for them right now
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.820]   because there's such a low supply of houses being sold
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.500]   and there's no refinancing going on.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.500]   They need something to grease the wheels a little bit,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.200]   but I like the idea.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.360]   - Okay, oh, before we move on to the next one, actually,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.120]   you mentioned our geographic area of viewership.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.760]   Look at what Dave sent today,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.320]   a new brew called Compound Interest.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.480]   It's not exposing for some reason,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.200]   but yeah, it's called Compound Interest.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.800]   - I like it, 424, right?
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.640]   Nice.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.200]   - Also some cool little bottle opener, coasters.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.320]   I don't know, I thought that was cool.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.800]   Thanks, Dave. - I like it.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.080]   - Okay, up next, we have a question.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.200]   - Holland, Michigan, not to be confused
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.480]   with Holland in the Netherlands.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.680]   - Right, people get that confused all the time, right?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.760]   - It's true.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.200]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Brennan.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.720]   I'm a recent university graduate
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.800]   looking to break into the finance world.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.000]   I'm starting to realize how many of the sought after jobs
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.520]   like research and investment analysts
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.380]   are few and far between.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.040]   I'm trying to build skills and knowledge
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.480]   that are reflective of the real world
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.040]   and looking for suggestions on how to go about this.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.360]   I also want Ben's opinion on CFA versus CFP
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.420]   and how someone might choose which path suits them best.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.480]   Now, this is very much out of my ballpark.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.400]   I don't know that much about this,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.960]   but those are very different designations, right?
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.440]   They're not even kind of similar, right?
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.280]   - Right, CFA is more for investment analysis
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.320]   and portfolio management,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.760]   and CFP is more for financial advice and financial planning.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.960]   So let's bring in someone who actually has both of these.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.440]   I've got the CFA, not to brag, Blair Duquene.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.680]   She went through both.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.040]   Blair, which one did you do first, CFA or CFP?
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.540]   - CFA, actually, yeah.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.280]   - Okay, I did the CFA.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.740]   The level two was the hardest one for me.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.840]   I'm guessing they're both similar in terms of
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.940]   it's a self-study program, you pay some money,
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.880]   but it's not nearly as much as like a master's degree.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.000]   And then you have to take some tests,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.160]   and if you pass the test and sign off on some ethical stuff
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.200]   and have enough hours worked or whatever in a certain job,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.120]   you get each of them, right?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.680]   That's how it worked for you?
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.560]   - That is how it worked.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.680]   It's still the same formula.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.840]   And I'm so glad you guys asked me this question.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.480]   Happy birthday, by the way.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.260]   Thanks for having me on your birthday.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.600]   I am sponsored by Christian Dior,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.480]   if anybody's interested in that,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.560]   in a different kind of apparel.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.360]   But anyway, I digress.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.840]   I'm so glad somebody has finally asked me this question
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.600]   because this has been debated online
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.720]   and on Reddit threads for years and years and years.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.600]   And so I'm here to tell you, officially,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.160]   that the CFA is better than the CFP.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   - Really? - Sorry.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.620]   Please don't take away my CFP.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.560]   However- - I was gonna recommend
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.400]   the other way.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.200]   So why do you, I'm curious why you say that.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.820]   - No, that's different than what I recommend, right?
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.000]   So which one is better?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.980]   Obviously the CFA.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.680]   It's the hardest test that there is.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.640]   It's the gold standard.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.780]   If you wanna prove that you belong in this club
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.680]   and are willing to go through the grueling tests,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.560]   CFA all the way.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.800]   However- - The pass rate goes down
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.840]   every year, it seems like.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   And the tests are hard.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.260]   I mean, it's not necessarily the depth of the information,
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.760]   is what I remember, it's the breadth of it, right?
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.800]   It's not, what do they say, a mile wide
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.680]   and an inch deep or whatever.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.040]   It's so much information.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   And the way that they write those tests,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.480]   especially the second one, I think,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.640]   the multiple choice questions,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.840]   it makes you think three out of the five answers
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.660]   could be correct.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.280]   So it's not like you have to be the smartest person
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.340]   in the world, you just have to study a ton.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.960]   I think they say for each test,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.360]   the average person studies 300 hours or something, right?
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.680]   - Do they make you open up your books
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.520]   and show your portfolio history?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.360]   Anything like that? - Yeah, I wish.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.240]   - Show you how your performance has been?
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.000]   - No, they're grueling tests though.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.560]   And I would say it's deep and wide, Ben.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.920]   So it's broad, there's all these topics
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.960]   that you have to learn from financial statement analysis
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.240]   to foreign currency translation,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.720]   to wealth management- - Remembering all the ratios
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.560]   and stuff, right? - Yeah.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.920]   - So you think the CFA is way harder than the CFP
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.880]   in terms of the test?
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.720]   - 100%.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.000]   And not only that, when you are in your CFA charter,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.280]   you're joining a global organization of professionals
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.000]   committed to raising the standards in the industry
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.120]   for the betterment of society.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.540]   So it is absolutely worth the effort,
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.480]   but it's not for everybody because,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.460]   especially somebody who specifically wants
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.360]   to be a financial advisor,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   not every financial advisor needs their CFA charter.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.680]   CFP is the gold standard for financial planning.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.640]   So if you wanna be a financial planner,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.000]   100%, the CFP is the way to go.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.600]   You're gonna study all of the topics
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.680]   that you need to study to have the skills
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.320]   to become a financial planner.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.640]   It is also broad.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.360]   It's not as deep or as grueling,
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.640]   but I'm not here to tell you
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.420]   that those tests are easy either.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.840]   But getting back to the original crux of this question is,
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.000]   it is hard to break into the financial industry.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   And it's one of the things that's been irking me
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.420]   for a long, long time.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.780]   There's no clear path to a profession.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.880]   You kind of have to scrap your way into it.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.000]   And so some other suggestions I would have
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.120]   is figure out what area of finance you wanna be in, right?
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.580]   Do you wanna be a financial advisor?
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.040]   Do you wanna be a research analyst?
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.360]   The buy side, the sell side,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.680]   investment banking, insurance.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.160]   There are a lot of different subsets of that.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.080]   And if you're not sure, there's nothing wrong
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   with going and working in a big firm
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.700]   to get some experience under your belt.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.540]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.360]   There's so many different routes you can go.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.600]   And a lot of people will dunk on the CFA saying,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.520]   well, Warren Buffett doesn't have a CFA,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.360]   and neither does Howard Marks
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.840]   and all these legendary investors.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   And so what makes you so great to be a CFA?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.060]   For me, it was I needed the education,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.680]   and I also needed it as a foot in the door.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.640]   I didn't have a great resume coming out of college.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.400]   And I actually got an interview
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.960]   at my second job that I worked at
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.200]   because I was just studying for the first level.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.160]   'Cause they saw it as, oh, he's putting in the work here.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.300]   He cares about the profession.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.140]   He's doing it.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.960]   So I think that's part of it, too,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.320]   is some places will, if you wanna be
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.480]   in portfolio management or an analyst or whatever,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.880]   they will make you go through the,
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.600]   or just the only interview people who have it.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.760]   And so I think that's part of it, too,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.480]   is you're showing that you have dedication to the craft,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.440]   even if it's not gonna make you
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.800]   the world's greatest investor.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.320]   So for me, it was helpful in actually landing a job,
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   I think.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.200]   - Now, do you have to have a college degree
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.640]   in something business or finance related,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.220]   or can anyone that trains up and studies
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.600]   take these designation tests?
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.900]   - It doesn't have to be related to finance,
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.800]   but you do have to have an undergraduate degree
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   in something.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.360]   That's one of the basics of the requirements,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.900]   but a lot of kids are now starting
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.560]   in their undergrad classes taking these tests.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.400]   - Yeah, that's new.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   That didn't exist when I was around.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.720]   But you do have to have a certain amount,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   you did when I, a certain amount of hours
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.880]   before you can get the designation.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.200]   - In the profession, yeah.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.520]   So you can pass all three tests,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.840]   but then you have the hours worked in the industry
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.480]   to use the letters and to be a charter holder.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.160]   - I still have nightmares about taking those tests.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.000]   I will say, if I was coming out now
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   and looking for opportunities,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.060]   you mentioned, do you know which path you wanna go?
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.320]   I would think the CFP would be a better route
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.480]   for having employment because I just think
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.040]   there's gonna be so many opportunities
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.960]   with all the boomers retiring in the coming decade.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.480]   The need for financial advice
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.000]   and the millennials getting that wealth transfer eventually,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200]   the need for financial advice
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.000]   is gonna grow and grow and grow.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.960]   I don't think it's going away.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.240]   I think the introduction of ETFs and index funds
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.480]   makes it a lot harder for a portfolio manager or analyst to,
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.200]   I don't think there's gonna be the need as much
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.660]   for those positions.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.500]   If that's what you really wanna do
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.160]   and you wanna be a stock picker or a portfolio manager,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.280]   the CFA makes more sense.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.120]   But I think if you're unsure about what to do,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.000]   I think the CFP is probably more helpful these days
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.280]   for a young person trying to break into finance.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.460]   - And I think it all depends on what you really wanna do,
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.800]   but you're absolutely right.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.400]   Portfolio manager, buy side, research analyst,
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.920]   those are the jobs that are going away
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.040]   as technology makes us more efficient,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.620]   but there's a real need for financial advisors
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.460]   on the other side.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.520]   So there's definitely more opportunity
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.960]   to make a career as a financial advisor.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.740]   - I still remember, I finished the third CFA test
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.080]   and I felt like I passed it.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.720]   And my wife and I went to Chili's
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.200]   and I had a whole bucket of beer
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.760]   because I'd been studying for six months straight.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.960]   So I had like a bacon cheeseburger and a bucket of Coronas.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.520]   And that's how I celebrated being done with the CFA.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.120]   - Well, when I walked out of the Javits Center in New York
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.240]   after level one, somebody, I think it was the local society
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.000]   was handing out t-shirts.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.520]   I passed or I survived level one of the CFA
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.080]   and I definitely did not feel like I had passed it
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.800]   that time 'cause I almost ran out of time.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.960]   So it is really, really tough and grueling.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.240]   They did move it to the computer
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.320]   so it's a little less of an experience now,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   but just as hard of a test.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.860]   The pass rates remain just as low.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.400]   - Yeah, not great.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.040]   All right, Duncan, next one.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.960]   - Okay, up next we have, we start off with a quote
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.880]   from A Great Mind to Finance.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.960]   "The only thing that matters is you come up with a plan
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.400]   "ahead of time and stick to it."
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.440]   Do you know who said that?
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.280]   - Sounds familiar.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.960]   That was one of my blog posts, I believe.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.440]   - Yeah, it's Ben Carlson.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.200]   Ben Carlson's who said that.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.440]   "How do you know if your financial plan is working
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.920]   "or if you need to pivot?"
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.120]   That's the question.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.340]   - Great question because it is difficult.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.280]   There's not much black or white.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.520]   You don't know what the financial market returns
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.800]   are gonna be, you don't know what your circumstances
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.760]   are gonna be or how your mind is gonna change
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   about things like spending and savings.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.480]   So Blair, when you work with clients,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.840]   how do you assess their financial plans along the way?
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.600]   'Cause it is more of a process than an event.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.480]   It's not like it's here's your financial plan,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   we're gonna follow it exactly like this
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.160]   and life is gonna work out great just how we plan it here.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.740]   So how do you assess whether someone is on the way
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.660]   to achieving their goals?
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.680]   'Cause it is kind of hard for people to understand that
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.520]   and figure out wait, am I actually doing this right?
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.360]   Am I on the right path?
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.880]   'Cause a lot of people just don't know.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.480]   - Yeah, and for people with black and white brains,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.000]   you know, engineers, accountants,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.960]   people who think in certainties,
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   it can be a really nebulous process, right?
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.040]   Because what we're taking is a lot of unknowns.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.280]   We don't know how long you're gonna live.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.760]   We don't know what your health will be.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.640]   You may not even know what your financial goals are.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.080]   The ones you have today may change in 10 years.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.120]   And we certainly don't know the order of the years
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.860]   of what the stock market returns are gonna be
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.780]   or what inflation.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.500]   So there we go.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.540]   Everything is unknown.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.020]   We're trying to make a best guess
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.140]   about whether we're on track.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.620]   But the things you can focus on
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.260]   are making sure you understand what your goals are
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.020]   and that they're clear and objective.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.180]   And it's okay to change your mind,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.500]   but you've gotta have a goal first
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.980]   before you can try to make progress towards it.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.260]   The second is you have to have reasonable assumptions,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.100]   right?
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.980]   I'm sorry, Dave Ramsey,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.340]   but you're not gonna get 12% average annual returns
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.180]   in your portfolio.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.700]   You have to have reasonable assumptions
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.220]   for average annual returns and for inflation.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.780]   So those are the two kickers.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.980]   And it's really figuring out
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.820]   what do we think returns are gonna average
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.420]   over the next 10, 20, 30 years?
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.220]   What are our expenses gonna be?
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.240]   You really need four things
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.980]   to put together a financial plan.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.460]   Your assets, your liabilities,
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.980]   your income, and your expenses,
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.640]   both now and in the future.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.460]   And then if you're sticking to the plan,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.060]   it's not about your recent investment performance.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.260]   That is not going to be the gauge
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.900]   as to whether your plan is working or not,
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.160]   because we know there's going to be downturns in the market.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.220]   So your financial plan success
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.460]   is not your recent investment performance success.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.380]   Those two things are not the same,
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.700]   but it takes a leap of faith.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.980]   It takes believing, okay,
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.860]   returns are going to average out
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.820]   to something around what my expectation is gonna be.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.020]   But the questioner may be mixing up
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.380]   investment philosophy and performance
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.060]   versus financial plan performance,
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.340]   'cause those are two very different things.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.180]   - Yeah, the point of setting expectations
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.700]   is you want to build into the fact
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.940]   that there's going to be bear markets,
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.140]   there's going to be higher rates and lower rates
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.900]   and higher inflation and lower inflation, all these things.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.700]   You want to make your plan durable enough
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.460]   to survive all those things.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.580]   To your point about changing goals,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.700]   we had a conversation with a client this week
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.180]   who wanted to make a huge purchase
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.660]   that was gonna totally change their financial plan.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.140]   And it changed their goals because of it.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.100]   So I'm gonna buy this huge thing,
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.780]   and now it's going to mean I'm not gonna retire
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.540]   for five to seven more years.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.180]   And they were happy making that trade off,
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.540]   but they would have never known that
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.740]   when they created their financial plan
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.180]   10 years ago or whatever, right?
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.700]   So I think part of it is making those course corrections.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.340]   And to your point in the expectations,
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.260]   then when reality comes along
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.020]   and five or 10 years down the line,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.860]   you kind of can gauge how close were we
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.940]   to those expectations,
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.020]   and do we need to make an adjustment up or down
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.740]   or based on where we're sitting now?
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.740]   - Exactly, I mean, it's just the future is unknown.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.620]   And so the most important thing is knowing your goals.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.860]   But my favorite call to get is plans have changed.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.980]   Can we rework the plan with a new goal in mind?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.900]   I love doing that.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.540]   And I also say a financial plan is not something
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.700]   that we do once and print out a 100-page report
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.780]   and put it in a desk and let it collect dust.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.860]   It's a garden.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.620]   We have to continually tend and weed that garden
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.540]   and update it.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.380]   So you're right.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.580]   What you said in the very beginning is it's a process,
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.100]   and it's just making reasonable guesses
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.420]   about an unknown future.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.940]   - Right, okay, one more question, Duncan.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.820]   - I'd be checking that balance daily.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.260]   You know, I'm just kidding.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.860]   - It's not good for your financial health.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.380]   - Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Igor.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.220]   We have no children and no need to leave anything behind.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.540]   Our current financial forecast shows that we're on track
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.420]   to retire 10 years from now when I'm 60.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.060]   We have 20 years of mortgage left at 3.25% interest.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.700]   In 10 years, we will have,
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.820]   assuming property value is the same as now,
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.100]   about $350,000 in equity,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.020]   with $60,000 left to pay on mortgage.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.660]   If in 10 years we have enough in savings to retire,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.260]   mostly 401(k),
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.140]   does it make sense to think about a reverse mortgage
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.180]   since we have no heirs to think about?
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.540]   This is one I'm interested to hear you guys discuss
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.260]   because I've heard of these before,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.140]   but I've never actually really understood what they are.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.380]   - Yes, the funny thing about this question is,
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.660]   before we get into reverse mortgages,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.940]   I think it used to be the rule of thumb was
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.980]   you want your mortgage paid off before you retire.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.580]   Now I think with 3% mortgages,
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.500]   people are starting to change that tune and rethinking it,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.580]   but it does make sense.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.260]   Why not bleed that home equity dry
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.660]   if there's no one to leave the house to
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.340]   and you're not gonna sell and downsize
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.540]   or move to Florida or whatever?
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.640]   Wade Fowler has a book on these things that I've read
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.540]   and it's more complicated than you think.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.820]   So Blair, thoughts on reverse mortgages
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.220]   and to Igor's point, why leave the equity there
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.660]   when they wanna stay in the house?
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.740]   Why not do something with it?
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.940]   What are your thoughts here?
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.560]   - Yeah, and you actually hit on one of the stats
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.380]   in the first chart, if you wanna throw that up, John,
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.660]   earlier in the show, which is that
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.900]   you were talking about the number of Americans
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.980]   owning stocks, right?
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.580]   And it's very concentrated in the higher incomes
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.340]   and that's what you're seeing at the top of this chart.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.400]   But on the flip side, for the majority of Americans,
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.100]   their home equity is their biggest asset, right?
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.740]   So, you know, those in the bottom 50%,
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.340]   you know, 13%, you know, is in their home equity.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.180]   They're gonna need it,
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.100]   but most people are kind of in the middle there, right?
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.220]   It's, they have a lot of home equity
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.100]   and very few people are using it, heirs or not, right?
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.420]   This is a big lever that people can pull.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.700]   So just to get to some of the specifics,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.540]   you don't have to pay off your mortgage
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.140]   to apply for a reverse mortgage.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.060]   Most people don't know that.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.760]   You have to have a certain amount of equity in the home,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.280]   but a reverse mortgage can be put on
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.700]   even though you haven't paid off that 3% mortgage.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.540]   - I guess I never thought about that.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.360]   That makes sense.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.300]   You just have to have a certain loan to value to do it, right?
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.260]   - To have equity, yeah.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.500]   And I think the minimum is something like 15%,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.120]   so they're gonna be well within the range
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.540]   of being able to put on a reverse mortgage.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.560]   The other thing is, you don't have to take money out.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.260]   You can open it like a credit line.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.660]   And John, if you wanna throw up the second chart,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.680]   our colleague Tony Isola had these two charts
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.180]   in a recent blog post that maybe we can reference.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.840]   You apply, you can't apply 'til you're 62.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   So there was the mention of age 60 retirement.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.320]   You gotta wait 'til you're 62,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.380]   but you can apply for a reverse mortgage line of credit
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.800]   and not even pull on it.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.060]   And that line of credit is gonna grow
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.800]   with the assumed growth in the value of your house.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.700]   So your line of credit that you could tap into at any time
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.580]   is gonna grow as you age.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.580]   And you can use the reverse mortgage basically as needed.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.460]   If it's a year where the stock market is down
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.040]   and you don't wanna pull out of your investment returns,
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.060]   use the reverse mortgage.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.820]   You'll never have foreclosure of the house.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.660]   You can actually,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.300]   because there's a federal insurance program,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.740]   end up taking out more on the reverse mortgage
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.520]   than your home is actually worth, and that's fine.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.580]   That's covered by insurance.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.120]   They're never gonna throw you out of your house.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.280]   I think it's a huge asset that gets a bad rap
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.240]   because the original home reverse mortgages were frauds.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.480]   They were expensive.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.600]   Before the government stepped in
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.080]   and started regulating these,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.480]   it wasn't a great thing to use.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.800]   But I think whether you have people
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.440]   to leave the asset to or not,
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.600]   it's a benefit that most people should be looking into.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.120]   - And to your point, with the middle class,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.040]   that being by far their biggest financial asset,
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.940]   people are gonna have to tap that equity somehow,
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.000]   whether it's selling a house.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.460]   And a lot of people, frankly,
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.040]   probably aren't gonna wanna sell their house, right?
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.840]   I'm sure there's some people who will wanna downsize
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.000]   or move to be closer to the kids and the grandkids,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.520]   but some people just wanna stay in their house
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.440]   or will want to, and I agree.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.180]   There's gonna have to be simpler ways of tapping that.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.420]   And this, to me, at that stage in life,
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.840]   probably makes more sense than a home equity line of credit
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.340]   where the rate can fluctuate and move up and down
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.340]   and change, and now those are very high.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.000]   So I think it makes a lot of sense.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.600]   - I do too, and unlike a home equity line of credit,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.620]   which when credit gets tight, like in 2008, 2009,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.240]   a lot of those were pulled away.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.520]   A reverse mortgage isn't gonna be pulled away,
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.760]   and you can't be foreclosed on as you would
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.800]   with a second lien on your house with a home equity line.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.180]   So it is an asset, it's an underutilized asset
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.380]   that I think a lot more people should be looking at.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.880]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.280]   And this is one of the questions too,
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.800]   where it's a different thing where the first question
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.720]   was about leaving an inheritance.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.960]   This person and his wife know
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.800]   they don't have to leave an inheritance,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.060]   so they're in a totally different ballgame too.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.200]   And yeah, I would ring out all that home equity I could.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.080]   - Absolutely, it's certainly worth looking at.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.120]   And now to even apply for a reverse mortgage,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.820]   you have to talk to a third party counselor
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.680]   to make sure that you are a good candidate.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.800]   And it sounds like based on the basic information
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.120]   that Igor provided that they will be,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.360]   but it's nice to know that there's a third party involved
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.400]   even before you go to apply for the reverse mortgage.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.860]   - See, there should be a third party involved
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.680]   before Duncan can buy futures on Oatly stock, right?
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.520]   - Indeed, an arbiter.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.360]   - I would much rather have a money therapist
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.000]   for that kind of decision than a reverse mortgage.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.840]   Sorry, Duncan.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   - Hey, keep your hands off my portfolio.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.680]   (laughing)
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.480]   - All right, we want to thank Blair
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.200]   for coming on today and helping out.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.320]   - Thanks for having me.
