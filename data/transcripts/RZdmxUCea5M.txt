[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Today on Grace To You:
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Wesley and Whitfield instruct us concerning the person of Jesus Christ in this hymn.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Born to save the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And that birth is how the New Testament begins.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the Gospel?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I'm always glad when Christmas comes to me.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Christmas comes around because I finally had the opportunity to sing one of my favorite
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   hymns, and it's only sung around Christmas.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   That hymn is "Hark the herald angels sing."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It is not only my favorite Christmas carol, but it is one of my very favorite hymns.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I'm not alone.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   In 1872, the Church of England selected the four greatest hymns.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   In the English language, and "Hark the herald angels" was one of those hymns.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I wait all year to sing this hymn.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And then I find myself singing it and humming it to myself all through the season.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It is a tribute to our Savior, our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It is one of the greatest treasures that the church has musically, and it is a treasure
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   to the mind and soul of everyone who has memorized the incredible words to this hymn.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It was originally written in 1739 by Charles Wesley, who wrote it as a Christmas Day hymn.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Fifteen years later, along came George Whitefield, the great preacher, great evangelist, and he
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   felt that the words needed a little bit of editing, so he Calvinized it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And fifteen years after the original work of Wesley, Whitefield brought its lyrics into the familiar form that we sing today.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It needed a tune, and the years went by, and Wesley had always said it needs a kind of a somber, slow,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   tune.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But it never really caught on with that kind of tune.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then about a hundred years after Whitefield, in the mid-1800s, there was a famous German
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Jew who was baptized a Christian, baptized into the Christian faith.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   This German Jew wrote a cantata in the honor of Johann Gutenberg, who invented the printing
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   press.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And in that cantata there was an amazing tune, and that is the tune that since about 1850
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   has been associated with Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and that German Jew who converted to
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Christ was Felix Mendelssohn.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So when you get a song that has Wesley, Whitefield, and Mendelssohn, it's going to be good, and
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   it is good.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It is the best.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I know you know it, but I can't go any further really without reminding you of the words:
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   "Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King!
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled!
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Joyful, all ye nations, rise!
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Join the triumph of the skies!
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   With the angelic host proclaim, 'Christ is born in Bethlehem!'
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King!
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Christ, by highest heaven adored!
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Christ, the everlasting Lord!
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Late in time behold Him come, offspring of the virgin's womb!
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see!
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Hail the incarnate Deity!
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel!
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King!
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Hail the Son of Righteousness!
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Light and life to all He brings!
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Risen with healing in His womb!
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   With healing in His wings!
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Mild He lays His glory by!
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Born that man no more may die!
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Born to raise the sons of earth!
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Born to give them second birth!
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King!"
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And there are at least three other verses that are not in the hymnal.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Great hymn, just an incomparable hymn, and every verse ends with "glory to the newborn
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   King."
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Wesley and Whitefield instruct us concerning the person of Jesus Christ in this hymn.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He is the newborn King, but He is also identified as the Prince of Peace, the Son of Righteousness,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   the everlasting Lord, the incarnate Deity, and most of all, Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's an almost breathtaking Christology in this magnificent tribute.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And, by the way, this is Christianity.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.400]   Christianity is that God, the eternal Son, left heaven, came to earth as a baby born
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:10.540]   to a woman miraculously without a human father, born to save the sons of earth, born to give
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.720]   them second birth.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.480]   That is Christianity.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.000]   And that birth is how we are born.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.980]   That birth is how the New Testament begins.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.180]   So let's go to the beginning in the book of Matthew and the very first chapter.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.640]   We're going to look at Matthew's account of the birth of the King.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.960]   First of all, the virgin birth conceived, and we'll look at verse 18.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: "When His mother Mary had been betrothed,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.700]   had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together, she was found to be with child
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.340]   by the Holy Spirit."
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:08.220]   This is just such a simple explanation of a staggering, incomprehensible, divine miracle.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:15.000]   The Bible does that a lot, simply states things that are beyond our comprehension.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.620]   We don't know anything about Mary, really.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.740]   We know nothing about her family, what they did.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.580]   But we do know about her character, which is what is most important, because in Luke
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:35.620]   chapter 1 and verse 38, Mary says in response to being told by Gabriel, the archangel, that
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:44.000]   she's going to be the mother of the most holy child, the Son of God.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.640]   She says, "Behold the slave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to Your word."
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.780]   This is a thirteen-year-old girl or so who sees herself as a slave of the Lord, a willing,
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.120]   loving slave of the Lord, who wants only to do whatever the Lord asks her to do.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.700]   She is a worshiper.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.220]   Over in verse 46, in response to this, she says, "My soul exalts the Lord; my spirit
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.000]   has rejoiced in God my Savior.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.460]   For He has regarded for - has had regard for the humble state of His slave.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.460]   For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.660]   For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name."
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.720]   And she goes on to quote Old Testament passages in that beautiful Magnificat.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.700]   She is theologically astute.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.420]   She knows God.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.300]   She knows the attributes of God.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.180]   She knows the Old Testament.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.000]   She's a godly young girl.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.960]   Now, she is, it says in verse 18, "betrothed to Joseph."
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.740]   You have to understand, Jewish marriage contracts were a little different than we have today.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.160]   People get engaged and disengaged and engaged and disengaged, and we've all become pretty
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.480]   used to that happening.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   In the Jewish plan of marriage, when you were engaged or betrothed, that was a very, very
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   common thing.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.380]   That was a binding legal covenant.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:25.080]   You literally bound yourself for life to the one that you had desired to marry.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.920]   You can find that back in Deuteronomy 20 and verse 7.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   Betrothal was a legal contract demanding, defining two people as committed to one another
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   for life.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   "Betrothed to Joseph."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.420]   Betrothal was a trial period.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.380]   There was no consummation during betrothal.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.780]   That came after the actual marriage ceremony.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.500]   There were usually several months during the betrothal period.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.820]   What was that for?
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.340]   Well, in some ways, the husband needed to make preparations for the wedding.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.700]   That would be an extensive responsibility that he would have.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.000]   But even more than that, it was a trial time to see if.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The person that you had committed to would be faithful to that covenant.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.620]   It was a time to prove your holiness, your virtue, and your righteousness.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.940]   It was clearly before they came together that they had been betrothed.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:34.400]   So they were set by covenant, by legal contract for a marriage.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.460]   But this was the trial period to find out if the person would be faithful.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:52.580]   And, back to verse 18, "Before they came together, before they were actually married, she was
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.200]   found to be with child by the Holy Spirit."
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:06.840]   The worst possible scenario was that a betrothed woman would become pregnant.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.920]   That's why you had the trial period.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.560]   She was pregnant.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.860]   To prove her integrity, her virtue, she was pregnant.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:24.180]   She was about three months pregnant, if you calculate what the New Testament says, at
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.420]   this time when Joseph gets the information.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.620]   By the way, she knew she was pregnant.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.620]   How did she know?
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.800]   Luke 1:26, "Because the angel Gabriel came to her when they were back in Nazareth."
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   That's right.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   That's the Bible.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   That's the Bible.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:46.920]   "And said, 'Behold - '" don't be afraid, Mary, "you have found favor with God."
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.240]   Verse 30:31, "Behold, you will conceive in your womb, bear a son; you shall name Him
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   Jesus.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.920]   He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.400]   He will reign over the throne of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.440]   He's the King."
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.320]   Now Joseph found out that she was pregnant.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.680]   I can't imagine the shock.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.260]   I can't imagine the shock and devastation, because this is a virtuous girl that he knows
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:25.920]   and loves and is committed to for life, and he finds out that she is pregnant.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.600]   And according to Deuteronomy 22, verses 23 and 24, if a betrothed woman became pregnant,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.560]   she was to be stoned to death.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.120]   So a cloud of suspicion and shame and scandal is hanging over her head, because she doesn't
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.240]   know how to explain this.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.580]   There's really no precedent for this.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.840]   There's no way to explain it.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.460]   In all human history, there's never been a virgin birth.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:08.440]   And now Joseph is in shock, because he's found out that she is pregnant, and he can't understand.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.020]   He doesn't understand it.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:20.260]   And so in verse 19, Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, not wanting to disgrace her,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.740]   planned to send her away secretly.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.120]   Righteousness is a wonderful word.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:36.660]   It embodies holiness, virtue, morality; but it also embodies compassion.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.320]   Part of being righteous is being compassionate.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.120]   This is a righteous man.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.180]   You might say, "Well, if he was a righteous man, he'd make a public display out of her."
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.000]   A righteous man would uphold righteousness, and a righteous man would make this public
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.520]   and say, "She has been unfaithful.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.160]   I want to declare her unfaithfulness.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.140]   We're going to bring her before the appropriate witnesses.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:08.200]   We're going to deal with this thing publicly, because she needs to be a warning sign."
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.060]   concerning this kind of sin.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:23.080]   But there is inherently within true righteousness compassion, and deep affection, and love.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.060]   He loves her.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.740]   He cares for her.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.720]   He doesn't understand what has happened.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.660]   He has no explanation for it.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.000]   But His heart is compassionate toward her.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.400]   And so we saw the virgin birth conceived in verse 18, and now the virgin birth is confronted
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.680]   in verses 19 and 20.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.880]   It's confronted by Joseph.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   They're betrothed.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.060]   He's a righteous man; that is, he desires to do what is pleasing to God.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.240]   You could even say that he has been declared righteous by faith in God in the same way
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.120]   that all Old Testament saints had; certainly Mary was one of them.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.800]   He is a true Old Testament saint, justified before God by faith.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.780]   The justification of that man, and even the transformation of that man's heart is evidence
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:22.080]   in his obedience to God, his desire to obey God, to marry a godly, virtuous woman, and
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.180]   to also demonstrate compassion.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.920]   Mary was precious to him, the girl of his hopes.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.600]   But he had to do what was right, but he doesn't want to disgrace her.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Back to verse 19.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.060]   "Wanting not to disgrace her."
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:46.500]   There's no bitterness, there's no anger, there's no hostility, there's no desire to make a
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:53.240]   display out of her, just confusion and compassion.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.200]   Two courses are really open to him at this point.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.000]   The harshest would be to make a public example of her; and even though capital punishment
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.400]   as a punishment for sin had disappeared in the history of Israel, there was still the
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:15.520]   threat of a public divorce, a bill of divorce, a public lawsuit against her.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.740]   She would be brought into some kind of court, and there would be witnesses coming into the
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:27.500]   court to testify against her that she was pregnant and that Joseph was not the father.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:37.200]   In ancient times, she would have been stoned to death; but in more recent times, during
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.900]   the time of their life, divorce had taken the place of stoning.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:50.920]   He could have had a public divorce and sort of exonerated himself, but he doesn't want
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.080]   to do that.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.820]   So he decided to - it says at the end of verse 19 - send her away secretly.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:07.000]   However, verse 20 says, "When he had considered this."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.500]   He was in the middle of considering it, meditating on it.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:21.040]   Apparently he falls asleep, mulling over in his mind what he's going to do with this
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.880]   love of his life.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.400]   "Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream."
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.380]   I don't understand the reality of that.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.720]   I don't know how to define that.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.800]   It says "a dream," and yet it says, "an angel of the Lord actually appeared to
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.400]   him in a dream."
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.480]   This is a supernatural experience; that's all we can say.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.040]   That's all we need to know.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.380]   "An angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream and says, 'Joseph, son of David,'"
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.920]   again reiterating that he is in the royal line, "'do not be afraid to take Mary as
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.840]   your wife, for the child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.480]   This is stunning, shocking.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.600]   It's the same message.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.560]   "Mary heard," back in Luke 1, "the child will be produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.140]   This will be a holy child.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.960]   This will be the Son of God."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.100]   So Joseph is now trying to figure out just exactly, "How do I fit into that?"
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:32.540]   A little wonder then that when the angel said, "Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife,"
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.400]   fear was the first reaction of Joseph.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   "Stop being afraid.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.100]   You can take her as your wife.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.960]   She is not so transcendent.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.160]   She is not so holy.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.300]   She is not so elevated that she cannot be your wife.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:55.860]   What has been conceived in her has been conceived by the Holy Spirit."
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:06.200]   Verse 21: "She will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.960]   from their sins."
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.200]   She will bear a son.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.380]   It doesn't say, "She will bear you a son."
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.240]   Never says that.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:24.400]   In Luke 1:13, the Lord said to Zacharias, "Elizabeth will bear you a son, because you
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.640]   are a participating father."
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.280]   That is never said to Joseph.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's just, "She will bear a son."
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.420]   This is Mary's son, and this is God's son.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.040]   This is not Joseph's son.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:52.880]   By the way, throughout the second chapter of Matthew, Mary is identified as his mother,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.760]   and Joseph is never stated as his father, never.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.800]   "Arise, take the young child and his mother.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.980]   And flee into Egypt.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.980]   Take your child.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.640]   Arise, take the young child and his mother.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.280]   Go into the land of Israel."
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.940]   This is not Joseph's son.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.940]   This is God's son.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.520]   This is Mary's son.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:29.260]   In fact, in the second chapter of Matthew, God says, "Out of Egypt have I called My son."
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:35.600]   Jesus was God's son, and Mary's son, never Joseph's son.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:45.560]   The mystery of all of this is profound and confounding.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.140]   And when it says down in verse 25 that He kept her a virgin until she gave birth to
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.720]   a son, I can fully understand that, that He wouldn't want to do anything to touch her.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:04.320]   It was not legal to do that anyway, just because they hadn't had the marriage ceremony.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.400]   But I think it's a great thing.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:14.220]   It would have been hard to imagine Himself even putting a hand on such a set-apart and
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:22.920]   anointed life chosen by God for such singular calling.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.620]   But Joseph, you do have a role to play.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:32.000]   Father gives the name, so verse 21: "You shall call His name Jesus, Yeshua" - Old Testament
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.200]   - "Joshua, for He will save His people from their sins."
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.160]   Yeshua means "Jehovah saves, Jehovah saves."
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.900]   That's His name, Jesus, Jehovah saves, for He will save His people from their sins.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.140]   So He is the Savior.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.200]   He's the only Savior.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.020]   He's the Savior of the world.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.140]   There is no other Savior.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.000]   It is God and God alone who saves His people, and He does it through the work of His Son,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Jesus.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.200]   There's no salvation in any other Acts 4:12: "Who is able to save?
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.000]   Who is mighty to save?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.320]   The virgin-born God-man, Son of David, Son of Mary."
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.780]   And then in verses 22 and 23 you have the virgin birth connected, connected.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:26.600]   We saw it conceived and confronted, clarified in regard to the name as the message came
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.200]   to Joseph.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.000]   But here it's connected, and it's connected to an Old Testament prophecy.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.800]   Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.360]   "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.320]   name Immanuel, which translated means 'God with us.'"
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.040]   That is a direct quote from Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 7:14.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   Here Matthew shows us that the virgin birth was promised, was promised.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.320]   And if you go back to Isaiah 7:14, that's exactly what you read with the addition of
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.600]   just an opening statement: "Therefore the Lord Himself is the Lord, and He is the Son,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.480]   and the Lord Himself will give you a sign.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.820]   Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and will call His name Immanuel.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.680]   The Lord will give you a sign."
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:21.100]   Galatians 4:4, Paul puts it this way: "In the fullness of time God sent forth His Son,
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:27.600]   born of a woman, born of a woman, but the Son of God."
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.400]   It's a final word, and the virgin birth completed in the last two verses.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.360]   "Spoke from His sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded Him, took Mary as His wife"
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:47.840]   - they had the wedding ceremony - "kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a son, and
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.640]   He called His name Jesus."
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:24:01.120]   He got the message, believed it, and named her son Yeshua, Jehovah saves, because He
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.200]   came to save His people from their sins.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.680]   He kept her a virgin, by the way, until she gave birth to a son, which means that He didn't
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.820]   keep her a virgin after that.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.160]   That's clear in the New Testament, because Jesus had brothers and sisters born to Joseph
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.420]   and Mary, and they're named and referred to.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.460]   She was not a perpetual virgin.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:30.300]   She had many other children, but not until after Jesus was born did Joseph come near
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.600]   her.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.000]   So that's the story.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.340]   That's the story from Matthew.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:45.680]   Paul looks at that same story in these words: "He, the Lord Jesus Christ, existed in the
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.980]   form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself,
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.380]   taking the form of a slave and being made in the likeness of men, being found in appearance
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.400]   as a man.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.800]   He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   . . .
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.700]   . . . and God highly exalted Him, bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.200]   that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those in heaven and earth, under the
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.180]   earth; and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.420]   the Father."
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.700]   The supernatural birth of Jesus is the only way you can account for His life.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.660]   An unbeliever once said to a Christian, "If I told you that a child had been born without
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.600]   a father, would you believe it?"
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.420]   The Christian answered, "Yes, if he lived as Jesus lived."
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:43.160]   The King is revealed, His birth proves who He is.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.520]   In Christ God came to dwell with us, with the sick to heal them, with the demonized
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   to liberate them, with the poor in spirit to bless them, with the meek to lift them
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:02.400]   up to His kingdom, with the fearful and guilty to free them from care and dread, with the
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.560]   wicked to cleanse them, with the diseased to cure them, with the hungry to feed them,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:12.260]   but most of all, with the lost to seek and save them.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.460]   Through His poverty we are made rich.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:21.240]   The King is born.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.900]   For all of us at Christmas season, there is a sense of madness, isn't there?
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:32.200]   No holiday all year long is so widely celebrated by God.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Christmas is the day of the world, and yet it seems as if Christ is absent in virtually
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.560]   all of the celebration.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   How can that happen?
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:51.740]   How can it be a celebration of the birth of Christ and somehow He be left out?
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.040]   But that's how it is.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.480]   For us as believers, on the other hand, we have to cut through the clutter and set aside
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.000]   all of the nonsense that tends to smother the reality of the birth.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   But let's get to the heart of the matter.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Let's focus on the greatest gift that God has ever given, the unspeakable gift of His
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.880]   Son our Savior.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.620]   I hope this Christmas season you'll be able to focus on Him, that you'll be able, in time
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:31.800]   with family and friends and even non-believers, to be able to make Christ the issue, to bring
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   Him to the front, to bring Him to the fore.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   That, of course, is the desire of the Lord Himself, and that would be our desire for
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   you, and I know it's your desire as well.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   So let's do this.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   Let's make Christ the real center of Christmas.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   And we thank you for being a part of the ministry of Grace to You.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   We hope that we have helped to focus you on Christ all year long and can give you a little
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.600]   bit of an impetus even at this Christmas season.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   Pray for us.
