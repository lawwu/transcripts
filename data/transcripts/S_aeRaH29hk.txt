[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   How do we decide who does what around the house?
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.240]   Amy, what do you say?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.280]   - This is Chris's segue to try to get credit
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.120]   for all of the work that he does.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640]   Because I would say Chris leads a lot of our digital life
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.580]   and I lead a lot of our physical life.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240]   And so it kind of breaks down that way.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.700]   But in all reality, I don't know that we necessarily
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.440]   have conquered this whole,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.920]   how do we divide household responsibilities?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.760]   I think there are natural divisions of responsibility
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   that just naturally, I actually very much enjoy
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.920]   doing laundry, it's therapeutic for me.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.520]   You manage a lot of the financial stuff
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.960]   or having to call banks and deal with payment stuff
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   because honestly, it's my nightmare.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And I really don't wanna have to touch that.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.720]   Understanding those things and funneling
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.240]   those responsibilities where maybe one person enjoys it
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.960]   or where doesn't find it to be such a burden
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.220]   makes a lot more sense than trying to equally split 50/50.
