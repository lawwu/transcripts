[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.720]   Today's show is an interview with Curtis Stone,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280]   Urban Farmer Extraordinaire.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.920]   He's gonna show us a path to
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   freedom,

[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.640]   all the good things in life. I think you're gonna love this one.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.520]   [Music]
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   If you're not familiar with Curtis, you should be, and after today's show you will be.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   We would have mentioned if you listen to show number, let's see, what was that?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   Show number 37, interview with Trevor Van Heemert of Pedal to Pedal.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   We mentioned a concept called spin farming, and the person that I had heard of in the past with spin farming
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.520]   was a man named Curtis Stone. And Curtis Stone is an urban farmer in Canada.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.600]   And today's show is an in-depth interview with him, and I think you're gonna love it.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.640]   A couple of just bits of info to pique your interest.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.360]   In 2012,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360]   Curtis's farm, Green City Acres,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.360]   grew over 50,000 pounds of food on less than an acre of land using
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.380]   100% natural organic methods and only 80 liters of gasoline.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.840]   Curtis started his business with a $7,000 investment,
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.880]   earned $22,000 his first year,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.840]   and then last year and this year
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.800]   changed the size of his business to the point where he works during the spring, summer, and fall, 40 to 50 hours a week
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   on borrowed land,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.680]   farming in the city,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.560]   and makes about $80,000 to $100,000 per year, farming in total about a third of an acre.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.680]   I think you're going to enjoy the show.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.320]   I like this urban farming, as you'll see in the interview. I'm not going to spend much more time introducing the subject.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.480]   I hope you enjoy this. And if you're interested in this kind of topic, urban farming, listen to this.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.800]   But even if you're not, listen to this and think about some of the techniques that you may be able to use
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.960]   and apply to your own business.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.280]   So with no further ado, here's the interview.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   So Curtis, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate your being here with me. Happy to be here.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.520]   So where I'd like to start
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.560]   is would you be willing, I know a little bit about
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.480]   just a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit about the topic that we are
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.380]   going to be chatting about today, but obviously
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.520]   I'm not here to be the one to talk about it. Would you give us just a brief introduction to
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.240]   to yourself, to a little bit about your background, a little bit about spin farming and how you got wrapped up in this
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.300]   slightly alternative type of agriculture?
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.680]   Yeah, sure. So
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   what I do is run a
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.120]   commercial urban farm, basically. I grow
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.320]   vegetables in the city of Kelowna, BC, Canada, and I do that
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.360]   on land that I don't own. And it's most often it's land that are
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.120]   front and backyards, like right in the city, right in the downtown core.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.440]   The farm has been different scales throughout the year, or throughout the five years I've been doing it.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   So when I started
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.920]   it was just with a couple front and backyards, and then
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760]   I was really successful at it. I actually made money at this
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.800]   model of farming right away.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.960]   I had zero experience in agriculture. I never had a garden as a kid. I never had any
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   formal education
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   in farming or gardening whatsoever. I just basically read some books and
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.440]   watched videos on YouTube and just went for it. And so the first year I was at about a quarter acre,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.200]   I turned a $7,000 investment into
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.840]   $22,000 of
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.760]   gross profit that year, and then I doubled that profit every year for four years until
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.800]   the operation... I doubled the size of the operation and the profits of it
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.480]   every year for four years until it got to about four acres
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.840]   of land total on a collection of about 10, or maybe it was 12 different sites.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   Some of those sites were up to two acres and some of them were as small as 800 square feet.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:33.200]   And so I did that for until four years until I realized that it was so big. I had eight full-time staff working
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.920]   and
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.080]   at that point I realized
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.760]   I
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.040]   kind of had to try all these different scales of it to see where I wanted to be. And
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.580]   at that point it was too big, it was too top heavy, too many overhead expenses,
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.680]   way too much work versus what I was taking home.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.320]   And so at that point I decided to scale back down to almost where I was in my first year.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.440]   And so now I'm operating on one third of an acre.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   The farm gross is about $80,000 to $100,000 a year. So that's 15,000 square feet.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.240]   It can make about $80,000 to $100,000 a year. I have one part-time staff
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.960]   and I pretty much do everything myself.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.600]   And you're only farming a third of an acre? Yeah, I'm only farming a third of an acre.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.240]   So what my secret is for that is basically
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.160]   looking a lot at Pareto's Law, sort of the 80/20 rule.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.080]   I basically, you know, when I was at four acres with all that staff
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.240]   and all that overhead and we had 80 different products that we grew,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.920]   I looked at what made money and, you know, it was that real 80/20 rule.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.960]   20% of those crops were making 80% of our profits.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.520]   So I pretty much cut out the 80% of the crops that we were growing.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.360]   And now I only focus on 15 different crops and I grow mostly for
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.640]   sort of medium to high-end restaurant clientele as well as I do a farmer's market
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.280]   once a week. But I used to do
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.400]   restaurants, farmer's markets, and we ran a 60-member community-supported agriculture veggie box program.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.240]   So I cut out the box program and I cut out a lot of the
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.400]   other restaurants. I basically, with my customers, did the same thing.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.320]   Looked at what was the highest yielding
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.560]   way for me to leverage my efforts and my profits, basically, and I cut all the things out that
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   weren't at that high margin. So now I sell to about
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.280]   I have about eight different customers, like restaurant customers, that I sell to and then the one farmer's market a week.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.600]   Wow.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   I wasn't expecting that.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   Previously, I knew that in the past you were running a pretty big operation.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   I didn't expect you to say you'd cut it right down. That is awesome. What a great application of
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.200]   looking to see where your most profitable market is. Are you having more fun now than you did when you had...
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.880]   Oh my god, yeah. I mean the beauty of it now, I mean this is five years going.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think I'm past that what they call the 10,000 hour
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.640]   benchmark, you know, when you put 10,000 hours in something you'd be kind of a master of it.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.320]   And so
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.000]   I've done that and now I work less hours than I've ever worked. I make more money at this than I ever did
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.240]   and I actually have a life. I actually have a social life. So I only work about 40 to 50 hours a week on the farm
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.840]   opposed to 80 hours a week on the farm, which is kind of the norm for most small-scale growers during the growing season.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.720]   And I no longer grow in the winter. So I used to
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.120]   run the operation
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   basically January to January and I did that with
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.400]   a lot of a collection of unheated greenhouses also
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   workshop area where I was growing in a controlled environment, microgreens and sprouts and things like that.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.160]   So now I only run the operation from April till the end of October and I have so I have five months off a year
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.120]   and I do other things. I do a lot of
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.680]   public speaking. I teach
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.640]   urban agriculture. I'm writing a couple, I'm writing a series of books actually on urban farming. So
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.620]   I expect some of those out in 2015.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.840]   And yeah, I'm kind of focused a little bit more on the education end of it. And so I've tried to make my farm
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.760]   more manageable so that I can actually focus on creating really high value educational content to inspire people to do the same.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.520]   Did any of your previous eight staff members take over?
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.440]   You know, I don't know what you would call them, your accounts or the land that you were farming
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.880]   or did they kind of continue on? Were you able to equip them?
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.680]   They did actually. So with that eight staff in that
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.160]   particular year
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.340]   it was a partnership. Like I merged my operation with another operation
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.240]   that were
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.040]   not quite as successful as mine, but they had infrastructure, they had some land
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   and they
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   more or less knew what they were doing. So
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.120]   they kind of just kept doing their own thing. Actually kept some of the staff that we had working for us as well.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.280]   And yeah, just kept farming and they seemed to be doing all right, too. Good.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.820]   Is your financial success peculiar?
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.600]   Or is it, I mean, I'm
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:15.540]   clearly you're applying skill and good business planning to it, but you know the numbers, your $7,000
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:23.440]   investment to turn a $22,000 gross profit, is that achievable? Is that replicable or is that unique to you?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.500]   No, no, it's not. No, it's not. It's actually, it's very replicable.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.320]   And
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   so
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   the model that I was using when I started was called spin farming. And in fact, I actually, I still to this day teach the spin farming method.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.120]   Though,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   you know, and in spin farming they say you can do
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.920]   $100,000 per acre using spin methods.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.440]   And that's the sort of their benchmark figures if you grow these particular crops in this particular way.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   Using a bed system, sort of
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:03.680]   pursuing some of the direct consumer markets like that I mentioned, like farmers markets, CSAs and restaurants.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.440]   But I've actually added a lot of content to the spin model.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   And so this is why I'm writing my own book, is that I've developed some methods where
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.760]   my figures can actually double what they do. So in my method,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   you can do $100,000 per half acre or less.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.400]   So this is a little bit more of an aggressive marketing strategy, a bit more focus on
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.200]   the restaurant market.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:42.560]   You know, focus, still utilizing all the direct consumer channels that most small-scale growers pursue, like the CSA model and the farmers market model.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.840]   But I go into a little bit more depth on how to utilize
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.120]   the restaurant and retail and
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.320]   other sort of market streams that exist
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.640]   that are out there. And as the local food system
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.680]   movement becomes more
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.440]   popular, more of these kind of business models are popping up. So it's kind of like
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.120]   utilizing a bit more of those things. Also, some more,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   as far as production methods, things that I've developed that weren't really
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   covered in spin farming. So these are things that I'm
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.840]   working on to put into my books.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.380]   Why are restaurants superior to individuals? Are they more reliable? Are they willing to pay higher prices? Is it that they can order continually?
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.680]   It's,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.440]   it's, well, no, it's not necessarily about the price point. It's about,
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.280]   the price point is probably about the same. Sometimes it's actually a bit less.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.240]   I mean, when you're doing bulk volume to people, you generally give them, you know, 25-30% off
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.980]   what you would at a farmer's market. The advantage is that they will buy volumes
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.000]   and they will also buy a lot of the same things over and over again. And so
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.480]   one example of this is a crop like radishes, for example.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.520]   Radishes are a great crop to grow for a farmer's market in the spring
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.600]   and the fall when there's not a lot of other product available. And, you know, they grow fast
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.280]   and you can move a decent amount of them to the restaurants. But come summer,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.240]   they basically become irrelevant, you know, as you have other summer products that come on stream.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.640]   People at the farmer's market aren't really interested in radishes. However, for restaurants, for restaurant markets,
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.700]   they will buy radishes all year round from you because they want some kind of consistency.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.840]   They don't want to have to change their menu every week or every month. And that's kind of the kind of clientele
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.360]   we're dealing with here is sort of the field to fork restaurants that,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.440]   that the niche market type restaurants that actually want to have a seasonal local menu. And so they like to work with farmers.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.400]   However, they still do want some consistency. So things like
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.560]   radishes, you know, I can sell 400 bunches a week
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.000]   year round or all summer long to these restaurants, whereas at a farmer's market, I couldn't do that.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.760]   And so radishes are a really easy crop to grow and they're fast. And,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.360]   you know, by focusing on these restaurant markets,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:08.480]   it allows you to really focus your production and go with things that just make money. It isn't about just growing
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.240]   a diversity of crops so that you have a really pretty display at your farmer's market,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.320]   which that's important too, and that's also part of it, but it's about just
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.800]   cranking out a lot of product that you can move in volumes.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.320]   And so this is the best advantage to restaurants is that they will take, you know, a restaurant order might be
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.840]   50 bunches of radishes, 20 pounds of salad greens, 30 to 40 bunches of
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   Tokyo turnips, 10 pounds of basil. You can move
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   bigger volumes of product
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.880]   and that means that you can turn over areas of land quicker.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.120]   And so one of the things about urban farming is when you talk about making money
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.480]   on a small plot of land, so I'm on only 15,000 square feet on five different plots,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.000]   in order to make money on that land, you have to turn over things multiple times.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.720]   So everything I do is in a bed.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.120]   So spin farming is kind of where square foot gardening meets commercial farming.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   And so everything is in a standardized bed.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.280]   And you can't just plant these beds once out in a season
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.200]   and hope to make money. You have to harvest the contents of that crop in a bed,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.960]   amend the soil, turn it over and replant it again. And so some of my
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.440]   beds get turned over up to seven times in a season. So when I say I'm on a third of an acre,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.160]   in a traditional farming sense,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.520]   I'm actually on say six times that land because I'm turning that land over so many times.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:44.480]   And so this is why I generally focus on crops that not only have a high dollar value per square foot,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.960]   but also have a short date to maturity. So I only focus on crops that
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.720]   grow and are ready to harvest within about 60 days.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.980]   And there's some exceptions to that with tomatoes and patty pan squash.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.560]   And
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:05.040]   I'm also growing crops that will yield high in a small area. So I don't grow anything like corn,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.820]   winter squash, cabbages, potatoes, onions,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.920]   melons. I don't grow anything like that. I'm focusing on baby root vegetables, salad greens,
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.120]   specialty herbs,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.280]   and there's all kinds of varieties of things within those categories of crops.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.800]   Is the way that you're doing it, is it a sustainable system where you're able to keep doing it?
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.720]   Or do you have to rest the land after a certain amount of time? We can farm our soil
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.520]   continuously. I mean, like I said, I've done this year round
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.240]   for the majority of my years farming
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.960]   and it's all basically
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.520]   biointensive organic methods where
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.400]   high amounts of organic matter go into the soil
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.000]   and the soil gets better and better. And so
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.960]   there are inputs. The system requires inputs. So I spend
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.280]   not a lot of money, but I do buy considerable amounts of compost every year. I build my own compost
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.920]   and I buy organic fertilizers such as bone meal and feather meal and
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   things like that. And I have to put things into the soil, but yes, it's absolutely sustainable.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.280]   And really one of the greatest advantages to urban farming is if you
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.720]   talk about maybe a futuristic scenario where we
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:28.560]   not a futuristic scenario, maybe it's like a near future scenario where these inputs that I'm required to use are no longer as available to me.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:35.280]   Living in a city, I have access to all kinds of waste byproducts that are seen as waste, but are actually resources.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.200]   So restaurants, when I deliver to restaurants, I take their scraps of vegetables and buckets and five gallon buckets
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.600]   and I build my own compost that way so I can actually build my own fertility into the soil.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.120]   I don't do that
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.960]   so much right now because the economics of it are just they don't really add up.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.840]   To build your own compost and soil, the labor that goes into it,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:07.200]   it just isn't worth the value that you get out of it. But in a scenario where resources become a lot more
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.600]   valued and the price of everything goes up, then
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.680]   that's a situation that we could utilize that system and it would be economical. But right now it isn't, so I don't bother.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.200]   I kind of go with the path of least resistance and go with what works at the current time.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.640]   But knowing that if I did need to go that way, it wouldn't be a hard shift.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.360]   Right. I mean the economic system is always going to dictate. I think of the difference between
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.120]   I hate seeing all the garbage that we produce in this country and there's so many useful things probably
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.840]   in there that we don't harvest.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.200]   But I remember being in Guatemala City one time at the
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.320]   Basurero, the garbage dump right in the middle of the city, and you see hundreds of people
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.480]   who make their entire living. It's soul-crushing and yet it's also
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.900]   encouraging. And it's soul-crushing because it's a horrible, in my opinion, a horrible lifestyle.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:09.280]   There are hundreds of people make their entire living in the dump, on the dump, picking off
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   garbage out of it and repurposing it, whether it's recyclables or whether it's repurposing
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:23.120]   a piece of plastic into a piece of earrings. And it's really awful as far as just all kinds of sickness.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.160]   But yet on the other hand, you look and see the value that garbage can have when you have an economic system
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.400]   where that's kind of out of,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.540]   I don't want to use the word, out of whack. That's working differently where you have people that need a way to sustain their livelihood
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.940]   and here are resources that can be repurposed.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   And I admire the ability to
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.280]   repurpose the resources and I would love it if we just did it when it's easy,
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.080]   in our own front yard, in our own
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:55.120]   garbage dump, rather than send it on down the road like they do and it gets picked over by someone who's making their living there.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.520]   Yeah, exactly. I mean
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.240]   in an ideal world, that's what we would do before it came that way, but that's just not how our society works.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.480]   I mean, I really believe in prices, that prices of everything dictate
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   our actions.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   As much as I'd like to think that
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.160]   everybody is going to change their behavior based on the ideas or the concerns about
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.720]   peak oil and limited resources,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.940]   you know,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.760]   inflation or environmental destruction, but that's just not the way people think.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.600]   People only change their behavior based on the price point.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.400]   I mean, it's just the reality of it. And so it's just using
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   that understanding to
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.680]   create a sustainable system now on the small scale and being set up for when those changes really do
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.600]   come forward.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.560]   So how did you get into this? You said you didn't have any background in agriculture.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.760]   How did you wind up like discovering this as a business?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:21:00.320]   I was actually, so I was a working musician for
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.040]   all of my 20s,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   almost my entire,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.560]   my entire teenage and adult life up until I was about
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.260]   29, 28.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.200]   I was living in the city of Montreal
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:22.000]   and I was just making a real good, making a go at trying to be a professional musician, trying to make a living at it.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   And you know, I often tell people you think farming's hard, try being a working musician.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:33.280]   You want to work more hours and not get paid and not get the recognition that you want than just be a musician.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.120]   So I was doing that and
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:44.400]   I always kind of was like, I kind of came up in punk rock music and I was influenced by thinkers like Noam Chomsky and
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:51.680]   Norman Finkelstein and people like this. And I had a lot of concern about what was going on in the world.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.240]   And I wanted to do something about it. And the more I was starting to realize that my musical career
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.400]   wasn't going to make me any sort of a living that I could actually
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   raise my standard of living,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:12.000]   I started to look elsewhere and I started to look into things that if I wasn't necessarily going to raise my standard of living,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.160]   at least work towards something that I felt like I was contributing something to society in the right direction. And so
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   I started to get really interested in
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.580]   sustainable living, living off the grid,
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.480]   natural building, organic farming, what have you, all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.680]   And I just kind of went down a rabbit hole one year,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.860]   just cruising on YouTube, just like looking at all these different solution-based
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.120]   ideas in the sort of green economy. And
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.720]   I pretty much at that point realized that
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:49.600]   being a farmer was one of the best ways that I could truly live by my values because I could really take hold of
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.400]   what I was doing in my life.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.480]   So at least if I'm controlling the food that I'm eating and taking a stand on that
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:03.120]   and then making a living at that, then that would be a substantial step towards living by my values.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.360]   So
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:11.440]   when I kind of decided at this point about 2008 that I was going to leave Montreal and move back out west, and so I was
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.120]   originally from
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.320]   BC
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   in Canada, and so I moved back out here
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.920]   and I wasn't sure what I was going to do yet, but I knew I wanted to do something. So I had planned this
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.880]   bicycle trip down the west coast. And so a friend of mine did this and really inspired me
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.040]   to do the same, and he rode his bike all around the US and
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.600]   just had this incredible experience. And so I had this big trip planned where I was going to ride my bike from Kelowna.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.900]   Originally, I was going all the way to New Orleans,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:48.740]   but I basically had stops all along the way planned on organic farms, off-grid homesteads, eco-villages,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.520]   people just living off the land, all kinds of things like this, commercial farming as well.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.320]   And I just popped into these places on my bike and I would stay anywhere between
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.680]   two to three days to two and a half weeks.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:09.120]   And so I did that and it wasn't so much what I'd learned about farming and living off the grid or living off the land
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.400]   on that trip as it was what I learned about myself, kind of putting myself out there
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:22.100]   and really wearing my values on my sleeve. You know, when you're traveling by a bicycle, people can kind of clearly identify
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.240]   what your values are to a certain degree. And so I discovered that everywhere I went,
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.360]   I was just constantly approached by people that were
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.200]   the kind of people that I wanted to talk to. And so it was just this serendipitous experience that everywhere I went,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.420]   I just had these amazing, met these amazing people and all these amazing acts of generosity.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.240]   And I was just building this sort of network of people that shared my values.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.920]   And by the time I got down to San Diego, I was just so inspired by what I had done
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.400]   and just so
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.120]   jacked up on my own energy and what I created that I was like, oh my god,
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.680]   I have to live this way all the time. This is the way to do it.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.480]   And so at that point, I felt like I could do anything in the world.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   I came back to BC or Kelowna, BC.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.480]   I did another season of tree planting.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.120]   That's a job that I did for nine years to kind of support myself.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.720]   As a musician, I would go and work for two or three months and I could make,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.400]   you know, 20 to 40 grand in that time and go back and live as a
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.240]   poor musician in Montreal. I was kind of helping support myself. Yeah, it's a thing that a lot of...
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.520]   I've never heard of that.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.600]   Tree planting. It's something that'll...
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.920]   It's a job that a lot of Canadians do to put themselves through college. It's a real Canadian experience.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.520]   Where are you planting the trees?
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360]   Really, it's really, really hard work.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.160]   Just in
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   forested cut blocks, basically.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.440]   So this is the trees that have been logged and you're...
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.640]   Okay, got it.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.920]   So you're replanting what had been logged, basically, with little seedlings. And so it's something I did for many years.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.800]   That's cool.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.760]   So when I came back to BC, I did that for another year and then
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.960]   I figured at that point, okay, I had this five-year plan at this point. Like I'm gonna
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.360]   save money, do another five seasons of tree planting, save a bunch of money and then buy a piece of land. Because at this point,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.720]   I thought that that was the only way you could actually farm, was to buy land and sort of in the rural context or
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.240]   peri-urban context, buy land and be sort of a market gardener as we know it today.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.520]   But the land here is so damn expensive.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.080]   That goal was getting harder and harder to reach. And so
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.240]   I realized then, oh my god, I don't know if I can actually do this.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.720]   And it was like a serendipitous experience that a friend of mine
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.640]   told me about this spin farming stuff. And he said, oh, these guys making 100 grand a acre of land and
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.880]   they're farming in the city on lawns,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.600]   turning lawns into gardens. And so I was immediately intrigued. I bought this book called Spin Farming.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.920]   And
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.000]   that's pretty much it. I read, I spent a winter reading and researching this book, going online, learning as much as I could and then
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.960]   started the farm. And then that pretty much is what
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.240]   takes me to where I left off earlier when I told you
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.280]   where I am today.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   So was this out of a desire?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.600]   One of the themes that I'm interested in exploring with my show is
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.620]   how people make the transition from employee to entrepreneur.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:19.120]   And so I would think of you as an entrepreneur, but it sounds like, you know, you're an entrepreneur as a musician.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.080]   So this was less about the desire, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.680]   but it sounds like this was less about the desire to be an entrepreneur and be your own boss and run your own thing and
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.600]   more about your desire to connect with your values of
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.100]   sustainability. Is that right?
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.040]   Yeah, that's exactly it. And well, actually being an entrepreneur is the best way to do that.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.360]   Right. And it often leads to
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.960]   some of the most successful entrepreneurs and successful people in my life
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.920]   that I see in my life are the people that say, "These are my values," and then they live by them and they show that to
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   people. That's got to be one of the most attractive things that draws people to you. Right. And so
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.840]   yeah, yeah. I mean, it was, I guess I always wanted to be an entrepreneur in some way or another,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   and I guess I always have been. I was kind of,
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.600]   I kind of grew up in an entrepreneurial family. My dad was, did all kinds of different things, and
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:13.700]   he took me on the road when I was really young, when he was a traveling salesman, and he started a restaurant
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.300]   when I was about 13, and I worked in his restaurant. And so I'd kind of been around entrepreneurialism
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.920]   a lot in my life, and so it kind of just seemed second nature to me.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.400]   And I think a lot of the values that my father taught me
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.600]   growing up, I didn't really think about until I actually started to work for myself. But,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.160]   you know, just things like
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.700]   understanding the basic economics. If you're spending more money than you're making, then there's a problem with that. Right. And sort of the frugality
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.080]   of my dad really helped me in business starting out. And it's funny,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.200]   you think that a lot of people understand that stuff, but they don't.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.240]   And it's like the number one reason that people fail. So, right. I had a lot of that stuff, and
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.400]   you know, just the basic
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.080]   values, like old school businessman, you know, my dad was like that. He was like, you know,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.440]   he said, you know, if you shake somebody's hand, you make a deal, that's a deal, and you
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.760]   do everything you can to make sure that you follow up.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.480]   And I had a lot of that stuff going in, and it really worked well for me, is just to be
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.880]   the best I could be,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.440]   operate the most honest, and offer the best value as I can to anybody. And that stuff has done,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.160]   has worked magic for me. So I've had success at this for
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   five years now, and I've,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.240]   yeah, I guess I've made more money at it than I ever really planned on doing. And
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.760]   making money at it wasn't even my intention. My intention was to live by my values, but I've discovered that
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.500]   when you make your values clear to people, and they see you living by those values,
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.240]   the money just comes, and there's no real limit to what you can do with it.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.080]   Yeah. It's one of the things I have a tough time sometimes talking with, when conversations turn
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.720]   political, and turn towards,
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.740]   when conversations turn political, and turn against capitalism,
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:59.200]   I always, I often reach an impasse, because to me, I just see money, money is just simply a method of accounting for an exchange of
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   value. That's all it is. And
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.720]   so if you don't, I mean, the idea that money is somehow
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.960]   evil, or that somehow we've got to do away with money, or somehow we've got to do away with
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:15.600]   a capitalist system, it's just a system of accounting among people to say who's bringing the most value.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:23.280]   Oh, I totally agree with you. And I actually, I personally believe that is just a massive propaganda campaign.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:29.760]   You know, I could go into all kinds of conspiracy theories. Do it, we like conspiracy theories.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:38.000]   Well, it's just, you know, I got sucked into that whole thing too, with like shaming the rich and all that stuff, and
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.280]   I guess once you see things from the other side,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.720]   your opinions change. Right. And
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.040]   I don't know, I actually was, really grew up as a total socialist leftist.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.880]   My mother is a card-carrying NDP member, which is the, in Canada here, the New Democratic Party,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.520]   which are probably the most leftist party we have here,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:06.080]   and a full-on socialist party, and I was kind of brought up with that value, because I spent most of my time growing up
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   with my mother, because my parents are separated,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.980]   than I did with my dad. And so my dad had a bit more of the conservative,
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.300]   libertarian, even anarchistic values than my mother, but my mother had more of an influence on my values growing up than my dad did. So,
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.660]   you know, I believe that, yeah, I mean, if we should tax the hell out of the rich,
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.460]   we should tax the hell out of the people that are productive and all that, and I'd,
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.700]   I believed that stuff until I actually started getting into business and going, you know what,
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.860]   I'm just creating value for people. And so it wasn't so much,
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:41.100]   you know, I think, I think the money, the system of account we're using can be changed.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.960]   I mean, we don't have to use the US dollar. Capitalism, to me, the fundamental
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:52.460]   idea behind it is like what you said, is value for value. So it doesn't matter what that unit of measure is.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.980]   All that matters is that it is a unit of measure that you use into account for value. And that is widely accepted.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.900]   Exactly. And it could be all kinds of things. I mean, I'm really excited about where the
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:07.980]   cryptocurrency development is moving, and I think there's going to be a lot of future in that
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.060]   system. And
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.060]   so the
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.620]   what we're using exactly doesn't make a difference at all.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.140]   It's just that we are using something and I think it's very liberating in a sense to think that we have these
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:26.220]   new systems of account that are popping up. I mean, I personally believe, I guess I would consider myself a
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:32.860]   volunteerist or one that believes in more of the anarchist principles of things, is that these things are going to
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:39.580]   actually give us a real shot at living in that kind of world now, because a lot of these systems that we're creating
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.020]   are allowing us to not depend so much on the services that governments and central banks provide.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.020]   And so this is really, I think we're really living in an exciting time. Some of this technology that we're seeing today
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.620]   is
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:33:00.220]   allowing us to do incredible things. I think about 3D printing and we can print fabricated steel now. So it's
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.940]   really exciting to think
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:08.220]   that we're doing these kind of things and all this stuff's available to us.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:14.560]   And it's like this sort of the open source idea that we're seeing, you know, that open source technology
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.580]   sharing these ideas. I mean, we can develop things at an exponential rate now because of this.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.740]   And we're seeing this in farming too.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   I mean the internet and this sort of mass communication that we're able to disseminate information so quickly to each other.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.820]   We're seeing all kinds of developments in even in my field in agriculture than we've ever seen before.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.100]   And this kind of technology with 3D printing
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.700]   and whatnot, people are developing all kinds of small machines and
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:46.780]   doing incredible things. And so I think the future is really bright actually when I think about this kind of stuff.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.800]   You're preaching my gospel, you know, it's just the connectivity and the exposure.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.860]   And
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.780]   frankly, the reason I wanted to start this show is to expose people to some alternative ideas and ways of thinking.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:04.860]   Because you know your path, you pull up YouTube and you say, "Whoa, that's possible? That's possible? Whoa!"
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.860]   And all of a sudden it makes your mind just burst with ideas.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.700]   Well, listen, if that guy can do that, and if that's possible there,
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.740]   wait, I see here's something that I could do locally and I could apply this in my area.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.580]   And then all of a sudden you have an entire economy transformed. And
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:27.340]   you know, in a sense, I agree with you about cryptocurrencies. And I get so excited when I see how many
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:33.740]   merchants and how many different people are willing to do business in Bitcoin. Because in a world where
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:41.020]   somebody can pay you for your vegetables in Bitcoin, especially at the farmer's market,
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:45.900]   I don't know if you have any restaurants that are doing that, but the world is coming where they can just simply pay you there.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.940]   You can go to overstock.com, you can buy the stuff you need there,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.660]   you can trade with your neighbor for the meat or another producer for the meat that you need.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.060]   You can trade your rent. I mean you set this up. And in a world of competing
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:03.040]   currencies, and that's why I hope that there are five cryptocurrency
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.260]   options. I hope there's a barter network that's based on... I hope there's a hundred of them.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:13.900]   Yeah, I hope there's a... Go ahead, you go. Well, I think the really exciting thing for me is
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.940]   seeing how the ethics of nature are starting to come into our
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.020]   way of living in society. And I think
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.300]   we have to start looking at
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.980]   sort of anti-fragile or resilient systems. And so I think using the natural world
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.620]   is the perfect model
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:41.340]   for how to design our system and to design our societies. And if you look... So let's just take a forest, for example.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:48.080]   Let's just take a natural forest ecosystem. There are millions, billions, or trillions of microorganisms,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.160]   mycelium,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.480]   all kinds of, you know, synergistic
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.860]   life forms that exist within that system. And there is no
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:05.740]   central authority. There is no government in nature. Government is a monoculture. And so when we talk about
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.740]   why the food system is failing and why we're having all kinds of...
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:16.480]   We're finding all kinds of chronic illnesses now after 50 to 100 years of the green revolution.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.900]   We're seeing all these chronic problems and illnesses that are popping up in people because we've been doing it wrong.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.580]   In the natural world, there is no monoculture. Monocultures don't exist in nature.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.780]   And there's a reason for that is because they are fragile.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:36.960]   If one thing goes wrong, the system collapses. Whereas in a natural system, in a forest ecosystem,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.700]   there are many checks and balances that keep the system resilient.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:46.780]   So this is this anti-fragile idea that I like to talk about. And this thing exists within nature
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.980]   everywhere in the universe. And I think
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.620]   where we're moving to right now
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.800]   and where the successful people in the world will be moving to is looking at how to be anti-fragile. So how to diversify,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.500]   how to have
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.100]   systems that are resilient. And so those are systems in the economy, in the food system,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.940]   in production,
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:15.980]   in manufacturing, all kinds of things. And I think the more small scale we get, the more diversified we get, the more anti-fragile we are.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.860]   And so looking at nature as a model,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:24.700]   we can look at that as a way to design a truly anarchistic capitalist system.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.940]   Because we don't need to have a centralized authority. All we need
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:36.400]   are individuals that are willing to volunteer and choose what's best for them. And so what will succeed
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.380]   will be the thing that serves the most value for the most amount of people, not
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.060]   this is a gun in your face and this is how it's going to be whether you like it or not,
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   which is the traditional model of government that we have. And so I think all these things, whether it's
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:55.440]   Bitcoin and these Fab Lab manufacturing, all this kind of stuff is going to diversify us.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.080]   And I mean, you know, it's going to also turn, I think there's going to be a value shift.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.480]   I think it's happening now where people are starting to say,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.840]   okay, this sort of consumerist culture of where we're just
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:12.160]   human beings in society, we're just consumers. People are starting to go, let's just be productive because that
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.320]   3D printing stuff, all the apps and amazing technology that we're creating,
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   people are creating so much value for one another that
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   we can be productive again. And I mean, just for one example, and it's really old school thinking,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.360]   but as you mentioned, you touched on it a bit there too, is trading.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.120]   So trading value for value. The great thing about being a productive person and offering a service that people need,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.600]   which in my case is farming. And so I think that's where the basis of any
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:49.120]   new society is going to come from is food production. And then things kind of stem out from there.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.280]   But for myself as a farmer, I offer a product that everybody needs.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.400]   And so this gives me an incredible amount of economic leverage and I can go and trade
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.320]   the products that I have with all kinds of other services that exist. So I can get a carpenter, a welder,
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.720]   any kind of skilled labor to work for me on trade. And what I love about trade,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.040]   even though trade is kind of inefficient in the sense that
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.600]   for the people that don't have something that everybody needs, trade doesn't really work.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:21.380]   But for the productive people, it works amazing because it allows you to get the highest economic
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.320]   value for your energy. So
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:30.240]   if currency or money is just a reflection of your economic energy, when you put that into a dollar,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.940]   you immediately lose your economic energy. It's like putting it through a really inefficient
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.800]   copper wire to transmit energy from point A to point B. You have all this
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.200]   sort of like
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.080]   runoff of energy. And so it's the same with dollars. You go into dollars, you immediately lose to inflation,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.920]   you immediately lose to income tax, you immediately lose to sales tax.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:58.400]   Whereas when you go trade value to value in a trade scenario, you get the highest value for your economic energy.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.920]   And so it's something that I discovered was an amazing way for me to raise my standard of living
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.560]   really quickly without having to work more,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.160]   put in more hours or make more money. It's just
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.840]   moving this extra stuff that a farmer always has into some kind of trade scenario.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.480]   So it's allowed me to eat the highest quality meat and dairy, honey, all the things that I don't grow myself.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.240]   It allows me to get all that high quality nutritionally dense food for nothing, basically.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   So it's allowed me to raise my quality of living. And so I think all this
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:40.160]   going into being a productive individual is what's going to change our society.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.020]   And I think we will go back to valuing the productive individuals.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.800]   I think so. And I think it seems to me,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.520]   part of the reasons why
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:58.560]   I'm so interested in your story is because it just seems like a better way to live in this sense.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.360]   It feels to me, when I graduated from college, I went to university and I studied business. And when I went into school,
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:13.440]   I thought my goal was to graduate and be a Fortune 500 CEO because I was obsessed with the ideal of business.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:20.800]   And then somewhere in college, I studied abroad in college, and all of a sudden I studied abroad and saw a whole new side of the world that I'd never
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   really thought about. And that completely threw me for a loop. And I said, what am I doing?
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.840]   And I wound up finishing still with a business degree.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.200]   But then I went and worked a year in a corporate job.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   And I just,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.480]   I only did it a year. And then I went and worked in the cubicle world.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.800]   But that opened my eyes to what it was like to work in the cubicle world. And I went from,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.300]   prior to, so during college, I was actually working in agriculture.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.840]   And I was running a,
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.600]   on a temporary basis, just for a few months, I was running a tree nursery here in Florida, where we grew
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:59.540]   basically a lot of ornamental trees, palms and various types of palms and things for sale to landscapers.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.720]   And I was running this for a few months and it was,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.000]   it was hell. I had to be there at five, I had to be there, let's see, what time did we start?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.720]   So the cruise started at six. I think we basically worked six to four.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.480]   And you know, the 10 hour day is standard in agriculture.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   So I had to be there, you know, before six to get things set up.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.560]   And then I would wind up there till five and I would just go home, go home, just completely beat and
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.320]   not do anything except sleep all night so I could get up and do it the next day.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.240]   And I wasn't making a ton of money. I was making just, I was making enough.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.120]   But it was just kind of this constant, this constant work.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.920]   And then, so I had the opportunity to double my income and cut my hours by, you know,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.680]   30 percent by moving into the corporate world. And it wasn't a double income.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.720]   It was, I don't know, I don't remember. An increase, a significant increase in income
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.080]   and a significant decrease in hours by going into the corporate world.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.400]   So I went and did it. But the problem was I missed kind of that that sense of
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:02.160]   beauty of doing something with your hands where you finished it and you looked at it and it was beautiful.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.600]   You know, you finished trimming the palm trees and they looked good.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.400]   You mowed the grass and it looked good and you had that sense of achievement.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   And then I just went into a world of spreadsheets.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.800]   So then you look at it and you say, well, let's analyze what's wrong with it.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.280]   Well, in the corporate world, you're just, you're one,
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.040]   you're one part of many and that has huge value.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.000]   But you're just a pawn. You can be taken out and you can be put in.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.080]   I wound up getting laid off from the corporate job several iterations of the job later.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.760]   You can be taken out and someone else can be put in. And you don't have the sense of
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.480]   satisfaction of doing something. You don't have that sense of effort of doing that hard work and being done with it.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.000]   But you go to agriculture and you say, I'm doomed to no money and a terrible standard of living.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:52.800]   But when I thought back about it, I said, well, A, if I'd actually, let's say that I was in what are the bucolic
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.560]   traditional view we have of a farm. What are the advantages of it? I work from home. I control my own schedule.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.180]   I'm doing something where I can see. I'm doing something that matters. My family can be fully integrated.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.360]   I have breakfast, lunch and dinner with my family.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.560]   We have seasons where we work really hard and then we have seasons of rest.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.920]   And so that natural cycle, I think to me, is what I desire of this natural cycle.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.400]   Sometimes we work really hard and sometimes we rest. And so you say, but that's not possible.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:32.000]   One side of my family is in traditional agriculture out in Colorado and Nebraska in the western states.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.600]   And
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.720]   I look at the economics of their business and I say, it's crazy.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.320]   But then I look at the economics of your business and say, wait a second. You're telling me that with
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.120]   a very small investment
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.440]   and relatively no overhead because there's no debt
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:54.320]   and I can live right next to my farm and in the surrounding area and I can work on the human scale
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.400]   and I can make a good wage. It sounds like
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.760]   your book should sell like crazy. Well, I think it will. I mean, this information is going to revolutionize farming.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.160]   I also, you know, just kind of picking up
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.080]   where you left off there is that
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   the other thing that's going to
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.040]   get people back into farming on the large scale is the price point.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.600]   Is food prices are going to go up
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.920]   no matter if we like it or not. There's a few reasons, but the one basic reason is the average age of a farmer.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.320]   So in Canada,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.240]   I'm not sure what it is in the US, but I'm pretty sure it's close because worldwide it's around the same.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:40.080]   But in Canada here, the average age of a farmer is 59 years old and the amount of people that are leaving
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.680]   agriculture do not even come close to the amount of people that are coming into agriculture.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.540]   So, you know, I don't know if you listen to Jim Rogers, the economist Jim Rogers,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.660]   but he actually talks a lot about this and it's interesting to hear an economic
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.900]   economist talk about this stuff, but it's absolutely true.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:04.220]   Is that there is going to be in about 10 years or so a real crunch unless there is
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.860]   a mass
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.760]   move back into agriculture, which I think is possible.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.800]   We are going to see food prices spike like crazy and I'm not just talking about
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:22.240]   prices set to inflation. I'm talking about 100% increases in food prices because if we don't have the people
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.720]   in the field that can actually grow the food because they're just nobody wants to do it,
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.240]   we're not going to have any food at any price. It doesn't matter
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.920]   what it is because if there's not the farmers that can do the work,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.200]   then
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.120]   the price will have to go up because it's going to have to draw people back into the system. And so
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   I personally think going forward
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:47.840]   getting into agriculture now is going to be one of the best investments that people make because food is
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.520]   paramount. Everybody needs to eat. And so if you look at the numbers of people leaving,
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.960]   they don't even come close to the people getting into it.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.240]   And so the liberating idea is that, you know,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.840]   when I tell you that you can make a living and feed a family of four
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.720]   on an income from a third of an acre and a good living too, I mean 100 grand a year,
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.480]   that's upper middle class, right? Like I'm not just talking about
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.000]   you know working your butt off for 40 grand a year.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.720]   Yeah, it is and more importantly. 100 grand a year is a pretty upper middle class living and I think going forward
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.800]   we're going to see farmers become
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.840]   the new sort of
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.360]   upper class of society because it's a value shift. I mean and these things happen throughout history, right?
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.240]   I mean we see over specialization into one thing,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.360]   then there's a saturation and then there's sort of a mass exodus from that. I think, you know, no offense to you,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   but I mean in the financial world, that's what we're going to see. Sure, absolutely. We've seen
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.320]   so much growth
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.680]   and development
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.960]   in the financial world, but I mean some of these guys aren't making any money.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.920]   Like it's the top dogs that are making a lot of money, but I mean some of these underlings working at Goldman Sachs,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   you know, maybe they're making 80 grand a year, but they're working 80 hours a week. Right.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.040]   Whereas this kind of farming now and also, you know, you touched on the lifestyle a bit too
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.960]   and I think that's so important and it's something that people don't really look at
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:17.680]   the other capital that exists and there are many forms of capital and one form of capital that I'm really big on.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.080]   And so when I call myself a capitalist and I'm very proud to call myself a capitalist,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.360]   I say that word of pride,
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:29.840]   but I also tell people that I'm a social capitalist and that I don't just build capital that is dollars and cents.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:38.180]   I build social capital. I build community capital. I build educational capital. I build capital that exists within my community.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:43.040]   And but being a farmer has got to be one of the best ways to build social capital.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.980]   And so what I mean by that is as a farmer when you offer services
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:54.080]   and products that everybody needs in your community, there's a real needs benefit to that relationship.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.260]   And this is one thing that I think in our overly statist society,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.600]   you know, we talk about neighborhoods where people basically don't even know who lives next to them.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.240]   We live in these suburban communities where nobody knows each other.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.960]   There's a reason for that is because there are no needs benefit to that relationship.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.800]   And so going back into a society where we have
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.880]   people growing food on the community level, getting to know their neighbors,
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:23.840]   this is what's going to reconnect us with our neighbors. And so that's where that social capital comes into play.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.440]   And so the amazing thing about that is just like when you do good business and you do honest business
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.960]   and you do the best you can to offer the most value to the most amount of people,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.560]   all that stuff comes back to you. And it doesn't just come back to you in the form of money.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:42.240]   It comes back to you in social capital. So building relationships and people doing favors for you.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.120]   I mean, it's a lot of really old school thinking and a lot of it, you know, for myself came from like Dale Carnegie's book,
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.440]   How to Win Friends and Influence People, but it's, you know,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.480]   this other forms of capital that we can build that have this intrinsic value,
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.560]   but also have a value rooted in a community and rooted to the people you know.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.200]   That's what's so great about being a farmer is you get that really high quality of life where people
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.280]   really respect you and they want to help you because you help them.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.160]   Two themes. First of all,
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.840]   it's more than a hundred thousand dollars when you compare it to what the cost that you've pulled out.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.720]   So let's say that you have a hundred thousand dollar
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   job
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.560]   of salary and let's say that you have a hundred thousand dollar net profit on your farming business.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.440]   Ignore taxes, ignore any of the savings from barter, ignore any of the,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.080]   ignore even the own food that you eat from, that you produce from your own hand.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.920]   Ignore that. Just from the quality of life and the difference between being a hundred thousand dollar a year attorney,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.020]   where you have to support a vehicle that's appropriate, you have to support a wardrobe that's appropriate,
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:55.040]   you have to support the charitable contributions to the golf tournament and the lunches and the drinks with your friends because you're,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.420]   you know, you can't handle your job and I'm certainly exaggerating. Not everyone is in that situation.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:06.240]   But there are, but the hundred thousand dollar a year farming lifestyle where you walk out your back porch
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.440]   and on your block, on your, on the three city blocks, I mean your situation, you ride a bike to all this stuff, right?
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:17.040]   Yeah, for the most part I do use a small truck to do my deliveries to like my further customers.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.600]   But yeah, for the most part we run it all by bikes and trailers.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.440]   So you go out your back door and you got a bicycle and you got your three block radius
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.800]   and then you do your work there. I mean there is such a,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:35.940]   the hundred thousand dollars net profit is a hundred thousand dollars net profit with very few associated expenses.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.880]   And so that's a big number. And the second thing,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.920]   go ahead and respond. No, you go ahead. Okay.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.080]   I was going to say the second thing about financial capital and I'm glad you brought it up.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.000]   I would like to do a show,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.840]   I've pinned it down, and I've wanted to do a show on all the different forms of capital that I can think of,
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.080]   but it goes directly back to your
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.000]   forest web versus monoculture example from the biological world.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.760]   Is that in many ways, look at how devastated many people are when they lose a job.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:14.000]   It's terrible because their entire, if your entire system is, if the only capital you have
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   is the financial capital that you can earn by trading your human capital, your life energy for a paycheck,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.860]   and then that paycheck is interrupted and you're in the habit of purchasing
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:29.060]   all of your solutions through the financial system. Well, if the paycheck is interrupted,
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.520]   then your entire plan falls apart. And so many financial planners would say, well,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.560]   then you should have some backup for that. And some backup might be a savings account, an emergency fund,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.080]   you might have some investments.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.720]   But the problem is many times all of those things are predicated upon the financial system.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:51.360]   And what happens in our society is oftentimes by only focusing on one way of thinking about it,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.780]   by only focusing on the financial system, we can only get financial solutions.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:53:02.480]   But if you can bring back in things like the social capital, things like, I'll give you a very practical example.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.760]   I do in part of my work, I've done a good bit of long-term care planning.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.080]   Basically, what's your plan if you get older and you're not able to care for yourself?
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.320]   Well, throughout all of human history, that has been a fairly
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:23.200]   okay thing because you had an intense social network, you had a lot of social capital, you had family capital,
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.440]   where your family would provide that for you.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.680]   So you didn't need to go and work and earn money and save so that you could pay a nurse to care for you.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.120]   Same thing with retirement. You didn't always need to just go and say,
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.320]   I've got to save a lump sum of money that's a certain amount so that I can afford to retire.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.600]   You had a family structure, you had a friend structure. If you reach the point, if you were a farmer, and I know again,
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.000]   some of these metaphors maybe are a little bit too idealistic, a little bit too bucolic,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.080]   but if you have this idea, if you have a farmer and you're getting older and you're not able to do it,
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:00.000]   you would have younger members of your family or the neighboring farmer would come over and would lift the heavy thing or would help with
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:06.560]   the item that requires a younger body to do it. It would help with these things.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.700]   But in today's world, then all of that social capital and family capital has been greatly diminished if not destroyed.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:17.760]   And so now you're set to say, how on earth do I sit here and build,
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.140]   how do I save the million dollars that I need to save? And then how do I buy the long-term care insurance policy
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:28.080]   that I need to buy so that I can pay for those needs that I have with a financial system?
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.280]   And there's another way of doing it. I still think that the financial planning is incredibly valuable,
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:40.880]   but how much stronger is a financial plan if we build it like a web, where you can earn an income from a job,
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:46.400]   but you can supplement that income with a side business and you can supplement that with all of the
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.560]   eco-solutions that we have now, the sustainable,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:56.240]   you know, someone's farming your backyard and you have a guy that's farming your backyard.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:01.040]   So there you have a portion of the food. I assume that's how you structure your rents in some way.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:06.160]   You have some, instead of every month earning so that you can pay for your electric bill,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.120]   you've built out the insulation on your house. You've changed your energy usage patterns.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   You've installed some form of alternative energy source that you can buy, such as a solar panel,
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.320]   where you can buy it for a one-time thing instead of an ongoing thing. Now your needs for the financial capital are
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:30.620]   efficiently lowered. And so now we're building a much stronger plan, a web, instead of a single monoculture solution.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:35.420]   Exactly. And you know, this is interesting because the more I talk about these things,
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.380]   a lot of these ideas come to light for me.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:44.300]   And hearing you talk about that kind of spelt it out in my mind is that,
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:50.460]   you know, the idea of the welfare state that's been taking care of us,
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:55.740]   and the idea that we don't have to work so hard, it's actually done the opposite of what it is intended to do.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:56:01.500]   Because like you just demonstrated, all that need for that financial capital,
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:06.940]   because we don't have that social capital, that community capital, that human capital that had been there in previous,
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:12.460]   you know, in previous generations that would be there to take care of you when you get older, puts more pressure on us
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.700]   for the importance of financial capital.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:21.200]   But in an inflationary world where the value of our dollar is perpetually diminished,
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.540]   it means that we have to work harder and harder and harder to do so. So it's interesting to think that,
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.020]   you know what, to go the other way,
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:35.100]   focus on the community, focus on the social capital, those are the things that actually enrich our lives.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:40.380]   Right. Those are the things that actually will improve your life in the long run. Because when you really strip it down,
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:46.140]   when you really strip down to what is important in life, what will actually
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:52.540]   make your life rich, it's not money, it isn't things, it's human relationships. That's all it is.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:53.900]   And
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.180]   any of the big, even the most successful business people,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.820]   entrepreneur people will tell you that all you've got are the people you know and the skills you've learned.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.060]   That's all you've got. So,
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.780]   you know, strip all those things away. That's all that matters. And so
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.660]   building on those things is going to be the thing that's going to make your life better in the long run,
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.100]   even in the short run. So I think it's a very
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.900]   interesting idea and it's not something that a lot of people talk about. We put so much
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:27.260]   importance on the financial side. And you know, it's interesting the way you explained that the $100,000 scenario there.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.220]   It's very true. It's very true because I can't even,
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.860]   it's hard for me to quantify
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.420]   how much capital I've actually built outside of the financial capital.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.700]   I mean, it's kind of beyond my imagination when I really think about it.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:47.020]   The amount of people that I've connected with and the network of friends and partners that I've built up in this community here,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:53.180]   that when I really need something, there's somebody there to help me. Right. And you could, and here's the thing, if you,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:56.620]   I don't know, I don't know if, are you single? Do you have a family?
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.460]   No, I'm single. Okay. So here's, if you, if you,
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:07.660]   if your economic situation, something happened, you lost all your money, you lost your farm, you lost all your equipment,
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.500]   you had a, whether just natural disaster, tornado destroys, you know,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.060]   your town falls into the, into the ocean, for some reason, everything is gone.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.100]   You could get, you know, you could hitch a ride
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.580]   to another farm
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:29.020]   of somebody that you know, and in your work of speaking and being an evangelist for the sustainable agriculture movement,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.860]   you could have a roof over your head, a meal in your stomach,
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.020]   and a way to earn an income to build up your savings again to start your own business.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:41.180]   You could have it by the, by the end of the day. Oh, absolutely. I mean, this is,
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:45.420]   this is one of the main reasons I got into farming, because I looked at what I had,
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.320]   and I didn't have much. I had a degree in music composition,
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.700]   I had no practical skills, and I didn't even really have a lot of social capital, though
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:58.860]   I didn't even think in those metrics back then. But as a farmer, you have that intrinsically, and you can,
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:03.660]   you always have value to people, and that's, that's something that people overlook today.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.500]   They don't even, it's not even on their radar. It's like, what is your value?
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:14.140]   What are the things that you do that people need and people value? And that's all community is, is needs.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.540]   Right. If people talk about
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:22.300]   building sustainable communities, like it's something that the government can do. It will never be something that the government can do.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:27.740]   It has to come from the needs of the community, and until you have a reason to need your neighbor,
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.860]   there's no incentive to get to know your neighbor. Right.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.060]   And this applies,
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:39.900]   our systems in many ways, one more example, the social capital, are so
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:45.100]   twisted, even just in terms of family. And I'll give you an example. When I was talking about retirement,
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:49.500]   I think about, I think about this sometimes. My father is, how old is he?
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:55.420]   I can't remember. He's in his early 70s, and I think about my, my mom is
[00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:00.300]   as well, about, about 70. She's, yeah, just, she's 70.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.020]   I always get your ages mixed up in my head. So,
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.700]   but the thing is, is that I'm the, you know, I'm the youngest of seven children.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.500]   And we have such a tight relationship with my parents. They live on their own right now.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.820]   They live, they live,
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.820]   they're enjoying their condo lifestyle
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.780]   in West Palm Beach here. But we have such a strong relationship that I would never want to see my parents.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.100]   I hope that they don't live on their own forever.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.100]   I hope that they have an opportunity
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:31.180]   to come in, to come, and I hope that they have an opportunity in the future to live with my family,
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:37.420]   to live with my siblings, and to be able to enjoy their final decades on earth with their family.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.140]   And to me, I don't view that as a,
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.140]   as a negative thing, of something that I would have to do. I view that as something that I want to do.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.060]   So I look at that and I say, how did my parents build that desire in me?
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:52.460]   Well, it was built by having a strong relationship. Then I look at my son and I say, well,
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.980]   how am I going to do that? There is, you can't pay me enough money
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:02.780]   to take a big prestigious, you know, 60, 70, 80 hour a week job where I'm going to be away from my family.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.080]   Because it is so much more important for me to invest
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.140]   in the social capital, in the family capital with my children.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:14.000]   That is such a more valuable investment
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.860]   than any stock I could buy, than any business I could invest in.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:25.740]   And so the idea is saying, how can I invest my time and invest it into building this family capital?
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.220]   And if you look at it, the financial system in many ways seems to be exactly at odds with it.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:37.660]   And the financial system has brought about a higher standard of living for more people than ever in human history. And yet it has also brought
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.860]   fractioning families. It has brought, you know,
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.420]   depression, you know,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:49.360]   it's brought many negative things. So the problem is not the capitalist system. The problem is this misidentification
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.100]   of the various forms of capital and how to
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.700]   work within the system and find a solution. So, I mean, I would start a spin farm,
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.940]   or I would start a Curtis Stone farm in my backyard, whatever you call it,
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:12.220]   in my backyard, before I would go and take that salary job. Because then that allows me to simultaneously reap benefits of investing in my health,
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:18.140]   investing in my business, investing in my community. And I have a business now, my family can work alongside me.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.740]   So now I'm investing in my family. And now by stacking the benefits up,
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:27.900]   just like with good permaculture design or good design techniques, instead of just saying, I'm going to take one benefit,
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.820]   whereas I'm going to go away, I'm going to take a job, and I'm going to earn this, you know,
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:38.220]   $60,000 of financial capital, rather we say, I'm going to invest in my health because I'm being physically active.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:41.180]   I'm going to invest in my mental health because I can see the work of my hands.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.520]   I'm going to invest in my family's health because I can have my family relationships.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.940]   I'm going to invest in my financial health. I'm going to build social capital. I'm going to build this broad network.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.860]   It's just a much more holistic planning technique to apply to life.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:01.020]   Absolutely. I mean, I think we just solved all the world's problems right there.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.020]   We got to quit now.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:08.220]   But it's, you know, it's that's exactly it. I mean, it's actually really exciting to hear
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.460]   somebody like yourself
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   speak in those terms. And I think
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:18.540]   this kind of information needs to be disseminated to people. We need to get out of this whole
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.220]   system. And I think it's by design. I think
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:30.300]   the fact that we've locked everybody into this idea that all capitalism is creating financial
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.700]   value.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.220]   I think that is
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:38.060]   what has driven us to be so divided from one another.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:43.820]   Because if you really embrace the idea of capitalism, like what we've just been talking about for the last 20 minutes,
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.380]   it's absolutely, it's totally liberating because it makes you realize that
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:55.740]   human beings, in my opinion, human beings by their nature are very productive. We are very resilient.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.060]   We have survived and evolved over millions of years and have accomplished
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.760]   amazing things. And
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.300]   to think of a world where we live sort of like the movie Wall-E
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.900]   or
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:13.020]   Idiocracy, if any of your listeners are familiar with those movies, where people are basically just useless turds.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.860]   They just like sit in chairs and robots do everything.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:22.300]   And this is a sort of dystopian future that I think Hollywood is kind of trying to perpetuate to us for
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.820]   maybe there is a reason for it. But
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.860]   I don't think that it has to go that way at all.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.300]   I think when human beings or us in society start to
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.460]   really understand what real capitalism is,
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.840]   we can create
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.960]   enormous amounts of value and turn all these problems around that we have. And I think
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.800]   it all starts with this type of thinking, is like what is real capital? What kind of capital can you build? Because
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.440]   if we're all locked into just thinking of everything in the metrics of financial capital,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.520]   then we are so, we will always be dependent on the state
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.680]   to provide all the other things that the other forms of capital didn't provide for us.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:08.440]   And so when you really liberate your mind to say, hey, there's like probably 10 to 20 different forms of capital,
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.360]   and if you diversify within those forms of capital, you can create an amazing amount of abundance in your life.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.040]   And that's what I've done. I mean, just by doing this,
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:24.600]   it's all kinds of opportunities that come my way that I never imagined would have done so. By just farming.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.400]   And the great thing about being a farmer is that
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.320]   you learn a lot of different skills because you have to fix things all the time.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:37.820]   And so I've learned carpentry. I've learned a bit of welding. I've learned how to fix some small machines.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.960]   I know how to fix my bikes.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.480]   You know, all kinds of things that you learn from being a farmer is incredible. And in Japanese, actually, farmer kind of,
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.400]   that word actually means
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   the jack of all trades. It's like somebody that does
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:55.080]   everything. I didn't know that. That's neat. Yeah. What a cool, what a cool word. Yeah, I mean, and you have
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:02.680]   you have all those things as backup plans. Like if farming, let's say that, let's say that your predictions about the price of food are
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:10.520]   50,000% wrong and the price of food cuts is cut by 95% and your entire business model devolves,
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:16.500]   you have now a variety of trades that you can fall back on and you could go in a
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:22.820]   completely different direction because you've built skills. Exactly. And this is the thing that
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:27.780]   I won't go into now, but I've got a whole show planned on skills.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.660]   And it just seems so simple to me when you think about the fact that
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:35.540]   the amount of, this is the concept that's lost, going to financial capital.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:41.380]   The concept that seems to be lost, that I don't hear expressed very much in our society, is
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.860]   that
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.180]   the amount of money that you earn,
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:53.400]   let's assume an hourly wage, the amount of money that you earn as an hourly wage is exactly what you are worth in the marketplace.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:59.780]   I'm not talking about your worth as a human being and that. I'm just talking about the market value,
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:07.220]   exactly what you're worth. A radish is worth X dollars per pound and a tomato is worth a different dollars per pound.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.000]   So each of us has a certain value that's described by the marketplace.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.620]   And the only way to increase what we earn is to increase our skills, which increases our values.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.180]   But somehow we spend a lot of time, instead of going crazy on saying,
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.240]   "How can I develop my skills and how can I develop my value?"
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.060]   And then the marketplace will ultimately recognize and reward that value.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.740]   Many people just don't seem to grasp that. And that's what frustrates me so much
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.580]   when I
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:42.340]   get into, when people are working in jobs and I get into hourly wage and minimum wage discussions and I say,
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:49.220]   "Why are you earning minimum wage? That's a good place to start, but go out and get to work and increase your value."
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.300]   Because guess what? There are people that earn
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:57.540]   $100,000 for a day's consulting and you could do that too. You just got to develop the value of yourself.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.860]   Exactly.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.580]   Two last questions that I have and they're kind of two themes.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:08.740]   I don't necessarily need them to go on long or short, but they're two disparate themes.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:14.580]   And I'm going to finish, I'll tell you in advance just so we can guide our conversation there.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.100]   The last question I wanted to end on was kind of how to get started if someone was interested.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.500]   But before we do that, I'm interested because you do have exposure to
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:29.140]   many of the ideas that are coming out of sustainable design and ecological design.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.220]   I don't even know what the word to put on it is.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.820]   Have you ever thought about applying any of the sustainable design ideas to
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:39.380]   personal finance?
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.220]   And what I mean,
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.900]   and I'm just interested if you have any ideas. I think a lot about this and I think a lot about how to get off
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.980]   of the earn
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:54.180]   and buy treadmill and get on to the build and own so that I don't have to buy.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.260]   So I think of for example, I haven't seen one in person yet, but
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:03.460]   YouTube videos, I look at the earth ships that they make out in like in New Mexico and I think
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.820]   I don't want to live in, I don't really like the style,
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:13.700]   but how cool to be able to live in a building that heats itself, cools itself, provides its own water, provides its own
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.840]   electricity, provides that, you know that, how valuable is that on a dollar basis
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.640]   if we could bring that design in.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.680]   But I struggled, but so I think there's a lot of exciting technologies and I think that
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.160]   in many ways we should be
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:37.280]   focusing our financial planning on that, on figuring out how can I provide shelter that is efficient,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.080]   that doesn't require, that doesn't suck money out of my budget. How can I provide these things for myself?
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.160]   Do you have any thoughts or have you ever thought about that from a financial planning perspective?
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.960]   Well, yes, actually I have and
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.800]   there's some interesting work being done by a fellow named Mark Shepard
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.520]   and he is a,
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:02.400]   what does he call his system? It's... He's the restoration agriculture guy, right? Restoration agriculture, exactly. And so
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.960]   you know his whole idea of buying these, buying tracts of land,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.280]   so this kind of ties into like real estate financial too in the sense that, you know, buying
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.000]   really marginalized pieces of land
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.960]   and building those up and to be these like total utopias of
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.840]   food forests that are just like a garden of Eden.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:27.600]   And the amount of value we can really think about that stuff and this kind of goes into that the anti-fragile sort of
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.120]   resilient
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.240]   system stuff is that how valuable is that?
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.280]   You know, you've got this food, this natural food system that more or less takes care of itself.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.200]   You know, you need a lot of inputs to set it up, but once it's set up the system pretty much
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.040]   takes care of itself and it builds on itself just like a natural forest does. How much value is there in that?
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.960]   I think there's going to be huge financial opportunities in those systems.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:58.820]   And so the exciting thing about that idea is that all of a sudden now there's an economic financial incentive to actually
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.960]   heal the damage we've done to the planet in a lot of different ways. Right.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.880]   And so I think going forward there's going to be immense opportunities in that. I haven't gone into it myself, but
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.160]   you know with the Earthships too, exactly the same thing. Another idea that I've had is
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.280]   building small-scale district energy
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.680]   off-grid systems. So instead of having a
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.640]   solar power system entirely
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:32.800]   custom-built for your house, you collaborate with a group of neighbors and you build what's called a district energy system where you have
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.560]   there's one battery bank for 10 houses and maybe we share the solar panels on our house,
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.360]   but we collaborate and create kind of small-scale grids within our system.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.200]   So the only thing stopping us from doing that is government, is regulation and
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.480]   however else they try to
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.640]   prevent us from doing these kind of things. But I think there's enormous opportunities in those kind of things.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.720]   I think what people have to start doing is just putting their necks on the line and just taking the chance and just doing
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.220]   it. We need to stop asking permission.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.440]   We need to just start doing stuff. And when people come together
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:17.200]   and pool their resources and build that social capital in our communities where we know we've got each other's backs,
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:23.520]   then people won't be so afraid of taking risks. And I think that's where we're at today is because in our
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:31.860]   overly statist controlled society, it's like we are proletarians living in 1984. We're so paranoid and afraid
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.600]   of pulling outside of the matrix and actually
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.840]   standing to say these are my values. I'm going to live by my values. I don't give a shit
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.240]   if this is against the law or not. I'm going to take a stand.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:51.600]   If people start building that social capital in their communities, people will no longer be afraid to do that. And I think that's so important
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:58.080]   going forward because there's all these opportunities that exist, but it's the fear of regulation and the fear of
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.120]   being shut down that prevents us from doing it. The fear of destroying a career and it's fear.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.600]   And what's interesting is that once you get past it, you look back and say that was it.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.240]   But
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.440]   when you're on the side of it still fearing, it seems huge.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.720]   And so much of that comes into state of mind and this is like total Tony Robbins stuff.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:25.440]   But in my opinion, there's two states of mind. There's fear and scarcity mindset and there's joy and abundance mindset.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.000]   And so you have a choice every day on what mindset and state you're going to be in.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.240]   And so I try on a day-to-day basis to choose the mindset of joy and abundance because when you're in that state,
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.800]   that's all that you see and that's all that comes your way. I don't know what it is.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.960]   I don't even consider myself a spiritual person. I can't explain how these things happen.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.340]   But when I'm in a state of mind that's of joy and abundance,
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.920]   all I experience in my life are good things. All these things are drawn to you and it's magnetic.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.480]   But when you're in a fear and scarcity mindset, you're worried and you're afraid of
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.040]   losing things.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.080]   And that mindset exists for rich and poor people.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.960]   When you're really rich and you have all this stuff,
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.560]   but now you're afraid of losing it because now you have so much to lose.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.840]   You get stuck in that mindset and all the experiences you have in your life will be negative.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:23.040]   And so that's been a big thing for me is being in that positive joy and abundance state of mindset.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.000]   And then when you're there, all these good things happen to you.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.760]   And I can't explain how that happens, but it does. And I think,
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.320]   you know, we need to
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.040]   empower people and to make them understand that, you know what, as an individual person,
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   you have an incredible amount of power and you have an incredible amount of potential to be productive.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.500]   It's just getting outside of that fear and scarcity mindset and moving on to something that's more joy and abundance.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.120]   Well said.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.960]   If I wanted to get started,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.360]   if a listener is maybe just interested in
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.520]   pursuing
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.920]   what you've done and building something similar,
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.480]   where would you suggest people start and kind of how to go about it? And feel free to go as
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.680]   deep as you want or as shallow as you want. Yeah, I have a YouTube channel right now.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.040]   It's called theurbanfarmer.co. If you just put that in your ULR, it'll take you to my YouTube channel.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.800]   I've made a series of videos on what I do.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.160]   So if people also want more information or interested in taking any of my workshops or
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.280]   want to know about my book when it comes out,
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.680]   they can just go to greencityacres.com and then just like sign up for my mailing list.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.000]   You can choose, you know, what you want to sign up for, if it's my speaking events or whatnot.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.380]   And then, so the book that originally got myself into this was Spin Farming. So they can go to spinfarming.com
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.480]   and check out that book.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.040]   And that's kind of what I used to get started.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.640]   And yeah, I think that's about that will turn people in the right direction.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.360]   Is this the kind of thing that's possible to do part-time?
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.920]   Yes, it is. In fact, I encourage people to do it part-time to start. It makes the transition a little easier.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.400]   If you can set yourself up
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.480]   where you've got some kind of job, where you've got sort of secure salary,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.920]   and you are able to cut back, say 15 to 20 hours a week to focus on the farm,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.640]   it's absolutely possible to do that. And I really encourage people to do that where they don't have to necessarily go in,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.440]   you know, all cards on the table,
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.780]   full risk, and have that transition.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:33.280]   Sometimes that works better for others. For myself, actually going all in worked really well for me because
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.760]   once I had some real skin in the game and had a real risk of failure,
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.120]   that made me push really hard.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.240]   So, I mean, different strokes for different folks, right? Like some people like to do things a little differently.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.440]   I'm more of an all-in kind of guy. I always have been.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.160]   But yeah, the transition can be pretty advantageous to a lot of people.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.680]   Yeah, it seems to me that the key to
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.960]   a business like yours would be developing the market.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.800]   And if you don't have the market, no matter how great you are,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.960]   you know, sticking seeds in the ground and having them grow up, you don't make any money. And so it would seem to me that
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.200]   I mean, that's why the commodity food system is so attractive to many large farmers,
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.320]   is because you don't have to worry about developing the market.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.840]   But it would seem to me that, and I think the market, I don't know about your experiences,
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.600]   but I bet you've probably got more demand than you can handle. I know that here...
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:34.160]   Go ahead. I do. And just to pick up on what you're saying there, you're absolutely correct.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.440]   The marketing is the most important part of farming. The farming is the easy part. The work isn't easy.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.680]   Nothing is easy.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.000]   I'm not going to tell anybody that any of this is easy,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.040]   but if you talk to any successful business person or any successful person in life, nobody's going to tell you it's easy.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.260]   It's all hard. But the amount of enrichment
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:58.480]   and joy that I get out of the work makes it all worth it.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.160]   But yeah, you're absolutely right in marketing. That is the most important thing.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.840]   And so when my book comes out, that's my focus.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:12.000]   In my book, I'm not going to talk about how to build the best compost, how to build the best soil.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.120]   This is about the marketing and how the marketing ties into the production.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.080]   And so that's what sets the way I farm apart from what how most other farmers do.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.800]   Most other small-scale market gardeners, they plan their farm.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:32.560]   They do a farm plan in the winter that basically dictates every single week what they plant.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.760]   My farm is totally improvisational because I operate on a small scale.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.520]   I grow quick-growing crops and I'm totally based on what the market demands.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.600]   And so with my book, I'm going to get into how that relates to farmers markets, primarily restaurants,
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.400]   how to change your production on a fly and shift towards market demand.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.120]   So my farm is sort of like Tai Chi. It's sort of like bending to the will of what the market demands.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.280]   Good, good. Because that's the thing. The economics have to be compelling.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   And although the market, I mean, I tell you, Curtis, I don't live in a foodie place.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:15.120]   Although, well, here's my evidence. I think if we can get, I'd love to see millions of people start doing this.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.480]   And who knows, I may do it. I've talked with some friends and we've talked about it.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.880]   I just haven't seen the way to kind of get started with all the other commitments of my time that I have.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.160]   But who knows, I may. But I don't know. I have friends from across the economic scale,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.720]   from across the political scale, from across the age scale.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.800]   And I don't know anybody who isn't concerned about the quality of their food.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:46.160]   And where I live, there are on all sides, let's see, a quarter mile away is a store that's called Greenwise.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.000]   It's a Publix, it's our local, it would be like a Safeway, it's a regional brand.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.560]   And that's their organic store. There's a Whole Foods about less than a mile from me.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:00.240]   And then there is a Trader Joe's going in about a mile and a half from me.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:05.760]   And there are a couple of more gourmet markets that are within two miles of my house.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:11.760]   And so, I live in a wealthy place, but I just look around and I say,
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.720]   "The market is here for individuals and the market is here for all of these restaurants."
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   And I cannot find any local producers here in my area.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.200]   Now, I've not looked as hard as I'd like to look, but I've tried to change where I'm buying.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.920]   I'm sick and tired of not knowing where my food's coming from.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.800]   And I've tried to find producers and it's hard to find.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.480]   So, I think this is a tremendous business opportunity.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.840]   If you can hammer out and give the instruction on developing the market,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.280]   there's plenty of great information on developing the product.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.920]   And then I'll help people make the financial transition
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.800]   and give some of the financial planning tools to make the transition.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.680]   And together, we'll make the world a better place.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.840]   How's that for a rousing try to end on?
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.760]   Yeah, sounds like a great deal. Let's do it.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.760]   Anything else you want to share before we go?
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.640]   I think that's good, Josh. We covered a lot of stuff there.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.760]   Curtis, thanks so much for taking the time to come on. I really appreciate it.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.960]   Hey, my pleasure.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.200]   (SWOOSH)
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.800]   I hope you enjoyed that. Curtis, I certainly enjoyed the conversation.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.840]   It was exactly the kind of conversation that I love to have.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.080]   Wide-ranging, thoughtful, challenging one another,
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.160]   but yet agreeing and finding points of common interest.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.840]   I really enjoyed the interview.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.680]   I hope you have some things to think about.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.920]   I find this kind of stuff everywhere.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.480]   I think a lot about financial planning.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.600]   And I find inspiration in ways to think about financial planning
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.960]   in so many different areas,
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.040]   as you can see from just thinking about nature
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.520]   and the web that nature lives in,
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.400]   and polycultures instead of monocultures,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.120]   and how to apply those concepts to financial planning.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   So I hope that you have a lot to think about.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.360]   Again, as I said in the introduction,
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.600]   consider how you can implement some of these ideas in your own business.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.560]   If you're interested in urban farming, check out some of the links in the show notes.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.200]   I'm going to put some links to a couple of other interviews
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.680]   that Curtis has done,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.560]   one on an excellent podcast called Permaculture Voices
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.000]   that is particularly good,
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   and then a couple of other ones as well.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.240]   And check out his stuff, check out his information,
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.640]   and see if there's a way that you can...
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.560]   If you're interested in getting involved in this kind of thing, go for it.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.200]   To me, it seems I'd rather do that than work in a cubicle.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.360]   In case you haven't figured that out yet.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.640]   But if you're not interested in this, skip it.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.360]   But learn some of the concepts and figure out how to apply them,
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.040]   because there are thousands and thousands of similar ideas
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.960]   and thousands and thousands of ways to implement some of these ideas
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.560]   to your own venture.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.600]   Think about how he lowered the risk in the beginning.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.560]   Think about how you can lower the risk of any startup plan,
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.480]   design a plan to get you from here to there.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.240]   That's what good financial planning is.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.400]   It's all about designing a plan that's going to work
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.240]   to get you from here to there.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.920]   I hope you enjoyed that.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.680]   That's it for today's show.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.320]   A couple of quick updates as far as the rest of the week.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.680]   Tomorrow I'll be bringing you the final bit of the three tax planning ideas.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.000]   We did the timing strategies.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.960]   And then tomorrow's show I'm going to finish out the conversion
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.400]   and the income shifting strategies.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400]   So we're going to do some hardcore financial planning.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.600]   That hardcore financial planning, I hope you're able to enjoy those shows.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.400]   Yes, they are hardcore, but you need to understand them
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.440]   in order to figure out how to apply the stuff you always hear about.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.840]   Things like IRAs, or if you're up in Canada where Curtis is,
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.520]   your RRSP or ERSP or something like that.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.640]   Or if you're in Germany or Finland or wherever in the world you are,
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.800]   there's some version of this.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.840]   And you can apply these tax planning techniques no matter where you are.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.600]   On Thursday I'm going to bring you an interview with a musician
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.240]   who has been able to make an income on the web.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.560]   That'll be good. I hope you enjoy that one.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.280]   And on Friday, I'm hoping, I don't promise,
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.120]   but I'm hoping to have the show lined up
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.440]   with how to become a millionaire on a minimum wage job at Walmart.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.800]   And I think you'll enjoy that.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.480]   I'm going to talk about some of these concepts
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.560]   and show you how financial planning really integrates.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.280]   The technical financial planning that you're used to hearing about
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.800]   in finance books and everything, integrates with everything else.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.880]   And I'm hoping to bring that out in the show that I have planned for Friday.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.640]   I'm a little nervous about it because I want to do a really good job on it.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.560]   But it's challenging.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.080]   So I've got the idea.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.640]   We'll just see if I can execute it. I'm pretty excited about it.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.760]   Leaving Thursday morning.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.680]   So Thursday and Friday shows we pre-record.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.400]   Leaving Thursday morning and driving out to Texas for the podcast.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.520]   Movement conference.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.000]   Looking forward to that. Talking to some other podcasters.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.200]   If you're interested in podcasting, I would encourage you to come.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.320]   It's going to be in Dallas, Texas.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.840]   The conference is on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.680]   The tickets are reasonably priced.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.640]   And I think it's an amazing opportunity to connect with other podcasters.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.560]   I think in essence, in some ways, podcasters are going to save the world.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.760]   I'll prove that to you another time.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.680]   But I have high hopes for the industry of podcasting.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.200]   So those shows will be pre-recorded.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.280]   I'll be driving back on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.520]   If I can have some shows lined up to be released to you,
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.400]   I will have that. If not, well, you should have enough content here
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   to go back and listen to something else.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.080]   Peace out, y'all. Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:06.240]   I can't believe I said peace out.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.840]   The holidays start here at Ralph's,
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.520]   with a variety of options to celebrate traditions old and new.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.000]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.240]   or spice it up and make turkey tacos.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.560]   Serve up a go-to shrimp cocktail
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.880]   or use Simple Truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun risotto.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.480]   Make creamy mac and cheese
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.160]   or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection of Murray's cheese.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.440]   No matter how you shop,
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.520]   Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your holiday traditions.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.600]   Ralph's. Fresh for everyone.
