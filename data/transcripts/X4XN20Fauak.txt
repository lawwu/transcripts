[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   Pastor John, it's not uncommon, of course, for people to point to you as a primary cause
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.720]   in the recent upsurge in Calvinism here in the States.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.680]   Most recently, in his November 12th blog post, Roger Olson, who is an Armenian theologian,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.680]   points to you as well.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.600]   He writes this, "People often ask my opinion about the causes of this wave of New Calvinism
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.920]   among American evangelical young people.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.960]   I give much of the credit for it to John Piper.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.960]   John Piper is a force of nature, articulate, brilliant, persuasive, ubiquitous, prolific,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   profoundly Christian."
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.920]   Now, it's something of an awkward question for me to ask, and I'm sure it's a little
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.680]   bit awkward for you to answer as well, but how do you process that in your own mind?
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   What do you think has been your contribution to the upsurge in Calvinism?
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.320]   Well, that was nice of Roger.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.480]   He's not always that nice to me, so thank you, Roger, for those over-the-top words.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:11.920]   But I don't know, and I don't think anybody can know how anybody's investment in a cause
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.240]   has its cause and effectiveness.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.160]   We can see what people do, but we can't draw very confident conclusions that the doing
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   of that produced this.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.240]   I think everybody should go and read Mark Devers' article that was just republished
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.880]   and updated, I think in October, at the Gospel Coalition website on "Where Did All These
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.460]   Calvinists Come From?"
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.400]   And he gives a list of influences.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.600]   The ongoing impact of Spurgeon, Lloyd-Jones in these recent days, banner of truth recovery
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.560]   of the Puritans, evangelism explosion with James Kennedy and the reformed impact that
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560]   Kennedy had.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.440]   The battle for the Bible was mostly led by Calvinists, so the recovery of the centrality
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.840]   of the doctrine of inerrancy in the '70s and '80s.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840]   J.I.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.400]   Packer in his book "Knowing God," R.C.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.000]   Sproul in "Ligonier Ministries," John MacArthur, and I would add Chuck Colson to that list,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640]   and reformed rap.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.120]   There's an interesting thing about things like reformed rap or, say, campus outreach.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.160]   Reformed rap, you say, could be a fruit of the reformed resurgence, but the fruit becomes
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.520]   the root, right?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.200]   In other words, when something emerges as significant as that, it then becomes a causal
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.920]   force itself.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.600]   So it was a fruit, and now it's a root.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.760]   So I would just make sure before anybody thinks John Piper is Mr. Causal Effect.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's not that simple at all.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.560]   All those factors are feeding in, and as far as my role is concerned, I don't know what
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.960]   the causal effects are.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.880]   Only God can see that clearly.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.000]   What I know is what I have done.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.160]   So I stand back and I say, "If somebody says, 'Do you think that's right?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.520]   Do you think you have a key role in this?'"
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.440]   I say, "Look, here's the way I think about my life.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.000]   I know what I do, and I do what I do because I see what I see."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.120]   So here's the four things that I do.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   Number one, I have embedded reformed theology in the matrix of Christian hedonism.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400]   That's my unique little thing.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.160]   I embed reformed theology in the matrix of Christian hedonism.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   God is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied in him, which ties the central
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.560]   theme of reformed theology to the central passion of the human heart, namely to be happy.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.960]   And it says you can't have, Christian hedonism says, you can't have full and lasting happiness
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.840]   if the glory of God is not your treasure.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.960]   And more shockingly, God will not be glorified in your life most fully if you're not most
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.360]   fully satisfied in him.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.400]   That's my contribution.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.200]   I got it straight from Jonathan Edwards and C.S. Lewis, who got it from the Bible.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.960]   And then I circled around and have seen it all over in the Bible.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.880]   And that's what I think the main thing I've done is to put reformed theology in the context
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.640]   of ramping up the importance of joy and happiness and the emotions in the Christian life.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.460]   Second thing I've done is preached in one place for 33 years.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.760]   So that the message is proven in a people.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.060]   It's not a clever shtick for rambling conference speakers.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.840]   It's the bread and meat of real people from the cradle to the grave, living and dying.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.160]   So I think sticking in one place, preaching in one pulpit for 33 years, only had one church
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.400]   in all my ministry in order that I might not run from one hard place to an easy place.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.680]   I just stayed right there and I found that this glorious truth of God's centeredness
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.160]   really makes a whopping difference in the lives of ordinary people at every stage of
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   their lives.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.600]   The third thing I do is I write.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.880]   I say with Calvin, "I learn as I write, I write as I learn."
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.520]   So there are a lot of books by John Piper.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.920]   All of them saying the same thing because I have tried to apply in all kinds of areas
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.560]   of life that central truth that God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.280]   in Him.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.360]   And the fourth thing I do is I pray desperately all the time without ceasing.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.640]   I'm always desperate and so I'm always crying out to God to help me hold on to the gospel
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   in my life.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.160]   I do not take for granted that I will finish well.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   I never took for granted for 38 years that I would stay in the ministry.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.800]   I always felt vulnerable, vulnerable to being angry, vulnerable to being resentful, vulnerable
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.640]   to being lustful, vulnerable to being proud, vulnerable to being lazy.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.440]   I'm a vulnerable man.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.080]   Therefore I'm always crying out, "Help me, hold me, don't let me go, keep me useful."
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.920]   So prayer has been, I think, an essential part of my life.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.560]   So when I ask, "What are the causal effects of those four things on the contemporary scene?"
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.680]   The answer is, "I don't know.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   I don't know.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   In fact, I don't think much about it."
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.580]   When I'm done with a message or a book, my focus is resolutely on the next task.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.280]   So yesterday, I'm working hard to get ready for your phone call.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.600]   As soon as this phone call is over, I'm getting ready for Lansing, Michigan.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm not even thinking about you and these things.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.800]   I'm just on to the next thing, which means I view my life as just kind of dropping pebbles
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   all the time in the pond.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.160]   And I don't stay there and say, "Okay, pebble, what are you doing?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.480]   How are you doing, pebble?"
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.840]   I don't think that way.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.400]   I just move on to the next place on the shore, drop another pebble, go out, "Where can I
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.880]   find some more pebbles to drop?"
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.520]   So I don't really have much mental energy to be constantly assessing the effectiveness
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.360]   of my pebble dropping.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.020]   As soon as I'm done producing one pebble, I'm just bending my brain to try to see something
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.640]   new in the next text so that I can drop the pebble in the next city or in the next blog
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.800]   or in the next sermon.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.920]   So the answer is I don't know whether Roger Olson is right.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.880]   I just know what I do and I say what I see in the Bible.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.800]   And once again, you can find Mark Dever's thoughts online most easily in a blog post
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.920]   on October 24th of last year on the TGC website.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.440]   You can Google the title, "Where did all these Calvinists come from?"
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   And you should find it.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.840]   And tomorrow I want to ask another question raised by Roger Olson's recent blog post.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.480]   So where is the Arminian version of John Piper?
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.160]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   [END]
