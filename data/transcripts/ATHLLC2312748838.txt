[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.920]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.520]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.080]   and if you wanna make your home smarter
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.380]   and more energy efficient,
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.280]   which will end up probably saving you both money and time,
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.860]   then you're gonna love this episode
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.120]   with lifelong tech enthusiast, Matt Farrell,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.480]   who has a huge YouTube channel called "Undecided"
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.600]   and a podcast called "Still Be Determined,"
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200]   where he explores how smart and sustainable technology
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.120]   can impact our lives for the better.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.080]   Now, as an avid optimizer and homeowner,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.640]   I've DIY'd a lot of these things we'll discuss,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.120]   but I am really excited to sit down with a real pro
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.560]   to talk about everything from energy savings hacks
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.340]   to solar, to smart home tech,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.400]   like cameras, security, Wi-Fi, and a lot more.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.600]   I'm pretty confident everyone listening to this episode
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.560]   will be able to learn and save something,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.560]   Matt, thanks for being here.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.860]   - Absolutely, thanks for having me on.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.400]   It took a while for this to come together,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.440]   but I'm glad we're finally able to have this conversation.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840]   - We were in the middle of trying to decide
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.200]   whether we wanted to make some big energy savings
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.280]   and monitoring investments,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.740]   so I was like, "Well, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait,"
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.400]   and finally it got to the point that I was like,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.840]   "With technology evolving and budgets changing,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.140]   "that's always gonna be the case.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.480]   "There's always gonna be another thing
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.760]   "we all wanna add to our homes."
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.400]   - When it comes to smart home monitoring,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   we're at the very early stages,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.520]   and all these different companies are rolling out
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.560]   with all this crazy stuff
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560]   that you can put in your home right now
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.040]   to monitor your energy, improve your battery usage,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.300]   solar panels, all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.760]   It's a crazy time right now.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.080]   - Now, you've been doing this for years,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.120]   but you're in the process,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.760]   or maybe you're even done with a new home
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.600]   where you're completely rethought everything,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.080]   so I feel like, for a lot of us, this happens over time,
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.040]   but for you right now,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040]   you've probably thought about every element
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.760]   all in one short period of time.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.960]   - I'm actually in my new studio right now.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.080]   Just moved into the house three and a half weeks ago,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.320]   so we just got in.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.720]   It took about two years to pull this whole house together,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.440]   but yeah, I've thought about every little nook
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.560]   and cranny of this house,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.640]   all the different smart tech I wanna put into it,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.160]   the solar panel, energy storage, all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   It's been a long journey.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   - I thought one of the things you really, really know well
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.000]   is around the energy and the efficiency of a home,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.080]   so we'll start there,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.160]   and then I wanna jump into all the other home automation,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.640]   smart home stuff, and anything else we didn't cover.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.800]   So let's just start at the basics.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.960]   Can you cover what are the first principles
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.040]   of just building a more energy-efficient home
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.680]   and why that's important?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.320]   The first place you start is creating an airtight house.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.720]   You want a house to be as airtight
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   and well-insulated as you can.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.840]   It doesn't matter what kind of tech you put into it,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.240]   what kind of solar panels you put on it,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   if it can't hold onto its heat energy
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.880]   or keep heat out efficiently,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000]   your energy use is gonna go through the roof.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400]   So you have to make sure that you're building it right
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   to make sure that it meets certain standards.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   There's a passive house standard
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.160]   that is very popular around the world.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.120]   It's gaining ground.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.920]   I did not build my house to passive house certification,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   but I took a lot of the underlying principles into mind
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.680]   when putting this house together,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.720]   and I worked with a company
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.480]   that was able to meet close-to-passive-house-level
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   airtightness insulation values
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.000]   to make sure that every watt of energy I spend
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.640]   to heat this house stays in the house as long as it can.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   - And is that something that applies only to new homes
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.080]   or if I'm sitting,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   which right now is about a hundred-year-old home,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.080]   is this still something I can aspire to achieve?
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.920]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   You can retrofit old houses.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.040]   In a lot of areas,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.480]   you can basically bring in an energy guide.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.400]   In my area, I'm in Massachusetts,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.120]   there's a program called Mass Save,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.840]   and it's a free service through the state,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.040]   and you have a energy person that comes in,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.000]   evaluates your home,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.760]   and they'll give you recommendations of what to do
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.800]   to get your house a little more airtight,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.280]   a little more well-insulated
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.160]   to try to achieve these kind of things,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   and it's not like some massive, huge,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.280]   you have to spend $100,000 to do it.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.600]   There's a lot of low-hanging fruit
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   that you can really do on a house that's 100 years old
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.800]   to make it way, way better.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.760]   I actually got an email from a listener in Arkansas
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.480]   who had a similar program
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.320]   where the state had someone come out,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.440]   but they also paid for it.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   So they spent a couple thousand dollars
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040]   to re-insulate his attic, which blows my mind.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.160]   He told me in the email, he said,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.440]   "I saved about $2,000,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.080]   but I'm not sure if they'll be able to do that for you
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.920]   in California."
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.760]   (laughs)
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.920]   I'd say the same thing here with Mass Save.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.280]   I did it on my old house.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.920]   That house was built in the 1950s,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.840]   and we had somebody come in,
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.160]   they said, "You need some more insulation,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   and we can blow some insulation in,"
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.040]   and they covered, I think it was 60% of the cost
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.880]   of doing it all.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.920]   So at the end of the day, my wife and I,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   we paid, I think it was like four or $5,000,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.000]   and we got $10,000 worth of work done,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.400]   and it made a huge difference after it was done,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   and it wasn't a huge expense.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.360]   Is there a thing you would call that program
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.240]   for someone searching?
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.160]   Obviously, if it's Massachusetts, it's Mass Save,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.920]   but is it energy efficiency,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.280]   or what would you search online
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.200]   if someone was in Colorado?
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   That's a good question.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.840]   You'd be searching for something along the lines
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.640]   of energy evaluation, perhaps,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.880]   energy efficiency programs in your area.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.360]   That's something along those lines.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.760]   So that's a big misconception.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.560]   I think most people think, "Oh, I ain't gotta save money
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.880]   on home energy usage.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.240]   Let's buy smart plugs."
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   And it sounds like, "No, no, no, let's go old school.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.520]   Let's make sure your home's airtight."
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   So let's go through that.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.200]   Are there a few, even without having someone come out,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.640]   places that make homes less airtight
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.840]   that you can focus on yourselves?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.680]   Is it windows?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.160]   Is it insulation in the attic?
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.960]   It's windows, doors, and your attic,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.160]   'cause oftentimes you'll find
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.040]   that there's not enough insulation in your attic,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   and so you can have somebody come in
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.760]   if it's blown-in insulation.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.200]   It's really easy to do that,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   and it doesn't cost that much money,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.600]   but windows and doors are the biggest one.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.360]   Check the air seals on the bottom of your door.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   A good friend of mine who's out in California,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.720]   he moved into a new house,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   and he sent me a picture
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.960]   of what it looked like under his door,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   and he had a gap that was easily an inch
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.920]   from the bottom of the door to the floor,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.440]   and it was just sunlight coming in.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   If you have gaps like that,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.600]   just go to Home Depot, Lowe's, some local store,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.200]   and just get some new gaskets
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.400]   that you can put on the bottom of your door,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   seals around it.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.760]   You'll be surprised how much of a difference
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.600]   that can make.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.440]   What are some of the other big 80/20 principle things
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.760]   to do to affect your home energy?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.720]   The biggest use of energy comes
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.280]   from heating and cooling, for sure.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.800]   If you really wanna trim back your energy use.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.640]   If it's the middle of summer
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.720]   and you're trying to stay cool,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.080]   and you like it 70 degrees,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   maybe try 72, maybe try 74.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.000]   Even just one degree of difference
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.720]   can actually knock your bill down 5%, 10%.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.140]   So just go a little warmer or a little cooler,
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.560]   depending on what time of year it is
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.400]   and where you live.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.440]   That makes a huge difference.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.840]   If you live in an area like California,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.880]   you have time of use rates.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.800]   That's not everywhere,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   but if you really wanna save a lot of money,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.640]   shift how and when you're spending that money,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.480]   that energy.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.960]   So for instance, in California,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.440]   time of use rates, super cheap overnight.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.280]   What you can do is,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   you can over air condition your house overnight,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   and then basically turn the system off during the day,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.880]   and let your house gradually come back up to temperature.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.240]   So you're not using any energy during the day
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.440]   when you're trying to stay cool,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.360]   because you pre-cooled your house overnight.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960]   You're basically using your entire house
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.460]   as a giant thermal battery.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.660]   It's the same thing where I live,
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.500]   in the middle of winter,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.300]   I could overheat my house overnight,
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   and let it gradually cool over the course of the day
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.140]   during the winter,
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.960]   if I wanted to try to save electricity use
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.120]   with time of use rates.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.260]   In California, PG&E gives you multiple rate options.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.540]   There's like four or five rate plans where we live,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.540]   and where my sister lives.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.740]   You can choose different time of use rates.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.780]   In a lot of states, it's here's the rate,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.620]   and that's what you pay.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.060]   But just to set some expectations,
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.940]   the plan we're on, which is EV2B or something,
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.420]   they have names and there's so many of them,
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.000]   from midnight until 3 p.m., we pay the lowest rates.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.400]   And then from 3 p.m. to midnight, we pay the highest rates.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.440]   As inconsequential as this probably is
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   in the grand scheme of things,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.320]   if we're doing dishes, we set the dishwasher,
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.160]   and we just time delay it to run at midnight.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.680]   Obviously, if we're charging the car,
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   we charge it after midnight.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.000]   All the things we can do,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.600]   we try to push them off to happen
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   before three or after midnight.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.260]   And so definitely, PG&E is really nice.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.760]   They won't do this proactively,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.920]   but on the website, you can say,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.320]   run what my bill would have been for the last year
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.500]   on all the plans, and tell me which plan
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.620]   would have been the cheapest.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.700]   - Oh, that is cool.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.740]   - I will say, if you're gonna make a lot of changes,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.220]   maybe make those changes for a month
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.060]   and run the simulation on last month,
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.760]   because if you're willing to make changes,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.500]   the plan that makes sense might not be the one
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.620]   that would have made sense
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.180]   before you implemented those changes,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.420]   but that's a great one.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.580]   - What's the cost difference
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.660]   between the different rates that you're seeing?
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.780]   - So I wanna say the cost difference
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.980]   is about 2x on our rate plan.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.220]   It's quite expensive.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.220]   I'm on EV2B, but as an example,
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.900]   there is an EVB plan, which is different,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.900]   and it's 29 cents from midnight to 7 a.m.,
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.180]   40 cents per kilowatt hour from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.060]   and then 64 cents from 2 to 9 p.m.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.460]   So 29 to 64 is the range,
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.860]   but I think we're on EV2, maybe 2A.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.740]   I can't remember the name of the rate plan we're on,
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.340]   but I just know that ours doesn't have
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.780]   those exact time windows,
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.380]   unless it's changed, in which case I need to reset.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.940]   How are you seeing our energy? (laughs)
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.780]   - Yeah, where I am, I don't have time of reuse rates.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.820]   I heard they're coming.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.700]   We just don't have 'em yet.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.140]   I was actually just out in Vancouver,
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.140]   and I was talking to some people
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.380]   that they have time of use rates up in Vancouver,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.660]   but the difference is not like what you just described.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.460]   It might be like 12 cents versus nine cents.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.180]   So it's like a really tiny gap,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.300]   but 2x the amount of money.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.940]   Yeah, I just, I clicked the other link for EV2A,
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.820]   and one benefit of an electric car
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.220]   is that the cost of electricity
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.820]   is often cheaper than the cost of gas.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.460]   Another is that in California, at least,
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.060]   you can get on an electric vehicle rate plan for your home,
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.580]   and that peak pricing is a shorter window and a lower price.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.260]   So like I mentioned, we go from 12 to three at 28 cents,
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.740]   and then we have 59 cents from four to nine,
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.500]   and 48 cents at the other times.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.700]   We're kind of in the weeds right here,
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.140]   so I'll bring it back, but definitely worth
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.540]   if you are in a state that has different plans,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.740]   figuring out which ones make the most sense.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.900]   You said heating and air.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.420]   I'm gonna go through a few of my thoughts,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.340]   because we never had a air conditioner when we moved in,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.740]   and so we added air conditioning,
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.580]   and as we were going through this process,
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.660]   we noticed that there was a lot of inefficiency
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.660]   in our duct work, an incredible amount
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.060]   that we had no idea, and so I was talking
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.780]   with a friend of mine, and she was saying
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.260]   she had someone come in and say,
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.740]   wow, your ducts are really inefficient.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.100]   Everything about your system's bad.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.180]   We can replace the whole thing for this much,
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.340]   and then she called another person.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.420]   They said, well, actually, what we can do
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.860]   is we can seal off all the vents,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.780]   and we can just spray something into your ducts,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.940]   and it will do 90% of what replacing everything
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.860]   would have done for 10% of the cost.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.420]   So I don't know if you've had any experience
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.860]   with what they spray into these ducts,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.620]   but there are a lot of different options
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.020]   for how you modify and build an HVAC system,
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.340]   and then I'll just share a few HVAC hacks,
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.660]   and then I wanna hear yours, just 'cause I wrote this list.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.220]   Another one was we have this room I'm in right now
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.860]   gets significantly less airflow than other rooms,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.940]   and so when it used to be a bedroom,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.580]   if you wanted someone to sleep here
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.740]   'cause it's on the ground floor,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.900]   you'd have to crank the heat up in the rest of the house,
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.540]   and so one option is if your ducts are really accessible,
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.460]   you can add a fan in your ducts,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.260]   which will turn on when it senses certain temperature air
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.020]   and blow air to try to help redistribute the air,
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.580]   or you can get a register fan, which is what we have,
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.860]   so the vent actually has a fan built in,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.060]   and when it senses cool or hot air
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.740]   based on a desired temperature,
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.220]   it will suck that air in faster
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.180]   to try to help distribute things around the house.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.100]   So that was one big one that we had,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.020]   and then the other is just we got a lot of quotes.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.180]   When we added air conditioning,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.500]   the quotes were two to three X difference
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.980]   for people doing the same thing,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.640]   and so those are a few of mine.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.480]   What do you think about
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.420]   when you think about an efficient HVAC system?
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.300]   Oh, man, the duct work is a big one.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.900]   My old house, the duct work was not sealed well,
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.860]   so all the joints were leaking air,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.820]   so one side of the house was always hot
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.260]   and the other side of the house was always cold,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.500]   and we were always trying those hacks,
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.060]   like semi-close the registers on one side
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.620]   to try to force more pressure
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.780]   to get to the other side of the house,
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.620]   but when you do that,
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.780]   you can throw the HVAC system out of balance,
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.940]   which is not good for the system at all,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.180]   so the idea of the fan is a great one,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.180]   it's a nice hack.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.980]   I'm gonna get into the pricey options really quick
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.700]   when I say this, but heat pump all the things.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.540]   Let's talk about that,
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.260]   'cause that was a question that we had
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.940]   when we were talking to all these HVAC people
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.100]   about do we wanna do a heat pump,
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.380]   and unsophisticatedly came to the conclusion no.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.700]   Now feeling like I regret it, but talk about heat pumps.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.220]   Heat pumps are the most energy efficient way
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.860]   to generate heat or air conditioning, hands down.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.780]   Nothing comes close.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.620]   It feels like it breaks the laws of physics,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.140]   because if you're talking about electric resistive heat,
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.640]   for every unit of energy you put in,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.660]   you get one unit of heat energy out,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.860]   but with a heat pump,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.860]   it's not generating the heat in that kind of conversion,
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.940]   it's just moving it,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.300]   so it's taking heat from the air that's outside your house,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.180]   and it's moving it inside the house,
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.360]   and using a compressor to amplify it,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.840]   so for every unit of energy you put into the system,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.220]   you're getting three or four units of energy back out,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.540]   and it's the same for air conditioning
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.900]   if you're doing a reverse of that,
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.820]   so heat pumps are just the most efficient thing you can do.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.140]   The downside is they tend to be more expensive up front,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.940]   so when you're trying to price it,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.980]   it may look like a little bit of sticker shock
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.620]   of oh my God, what am I doing?
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.020]   This is 30% more expensive than this other system
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.100]   that's less efficient, why would I do that?
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.920]   You're talking about time frames.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.180]   What's that payback period?
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.840]   The heat pumps might take three, five, six years
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.120]   to earn their keep, but then after that point,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.020]   you're just saving gobs and gobs of energy and money,
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.020]   and would that replace a furnace
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.360]   and an air conditioner unit,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.900]   or what did the heat pump replace?
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.860]   It replaces everything.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.300]   A heat pump goes both ways.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.580]   In my new house, I have a geothermal heat pump,
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.480]   which instead of extracting heat from the air,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.760]   it's extracting heat from deep in the earth.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.540]   There's a 400-foot well that was drilled in my yard,
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.320]   and they basically just ran a pipe
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.160]   down that 400 feet, back up again,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.120]   and it's got a liquid that goes through it,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.200]   and it's like a giant water-cooled PC,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.360]   if you know about PCs.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.280]   If you want an air condition,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.880]   you're taking the heat from the inside of the house,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.560]   you're dumping it into the earth,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.320]   and the earth is cooling down that liquid,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.600]   so when it comes back up into the house,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.080]   that's being used to cool your house,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.240]   and then the reverse in winter,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.040]   if I'm trying to get hot air in the house,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.560]   it's extracting the heat from the earth
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.380]   and bringing it in and amplifying it,
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.740]   so it's one system that does both.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.240]   - Wow, what would a upgrade cost be?
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.360]   If someone just has a standard house,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   is this like tens of thousands?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.680]   - That's a loaded question, 'cause it depends,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   'cause there's so many different kinds of heat pumps.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.140]   You can get air source heat pumps, which are the cheapest.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.000]   If you wanna go super, I don't wanna call it cheap,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.360]   but they're still really good,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.000]   is a ductless mini-split system.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.760]   That's probably the most affordable way
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.840]   to get a heat pump system into your house as a retrofit.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   It's gonna still be more expensive than a typical house,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.200]   so let's say a typical heating system
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.320]   might cost you $10,000 for an upgrade.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.760]   This might cost you 14 or 13,000 or something like that.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.640]   If you wanna flip into what I did, geothermal,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.000]   your eyes will pop out of your head.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.840]   The sticker shock kicks in very fast,
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.080]   'cause they can get very expensive,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.240]   'cause it comes down to the drilling of the well.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.760]   That whole system, that whole side of it is expensive.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.680]   The mechanicals in my house are not the expensive part.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.000]   The really expensive part is drilling wells
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.480]   and doing all the stuff you have to do outside
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.440]   to get it to work, but at the end of the day,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.320]   you live in Massachusetts, it gets hot in the summer
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.240]   and cold in the winter, you're using your heating
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.600]   and air conditioning quite a bit.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.320]   We're using our air conditioning so little,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.120]   living in the Bay Area, we didn't have it
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.480]   for the first 12 years.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.120]   It's temperate enough that we don't need it that often.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.800]   The heat also doesn't run that often.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   So I think, if I remember right,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.360]   the reason why we ended up not doing a heat pump
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.920]   was that the less you use your heating and air conditioning,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.320]   the longer our return investment will take.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.520]   And I think for us, it's days a year
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.280]   that we use heating and air conditioning,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.000]   so it didn't make that much sense.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.440]   It's something I always tell people when they ask me,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.400]   "Should I get solar panels?"
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.560]   I can't answer that for you.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   You have to figure it out yourself
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.120]   because it's such a personal thing.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.920]   It makes so much sense for me for solar and geothermal
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.680]   in my current place right now, but like where you live,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.160]   a heat pump, the expense of that would make no sense.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.080]   You live in an area that's very comfortable
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.240]   for large periods of the year
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.520]   and you wouldn't need an air conditioner
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.720]   for a long period of time.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.240]   It would take you forever to earn your money back on that.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.040]   It doesn't make sense in your situation, so yeah, 100%.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.960]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.360]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.240]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.360]   for a good hang.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.360]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.320]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.840]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.700]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.120]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.080]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.560]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.640]   that you got through another week.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.760]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.280]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.040]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.160]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.800]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.380]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.360]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.400]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.220]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.280]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.920]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.400]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.480]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.340]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.360]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.600]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.360]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.640]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.200]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.340]   and my info as possible.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.200]   I also did the same for our parents.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.360]   And in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.340]   we found over a thousand pieces
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.640]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.600]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800]   and instead of spending 50 plus hours
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.160]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   it only took a few minutes
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.720]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.800]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.760]   for this episode.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.720]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.840]   and remove your personal information
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.600]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.720]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.360]   and get that removed as well.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.300]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.680]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.180]   in their first two years,
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.060]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.000]   for their customers.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.560]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.540]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.580]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.100]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.580]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.860]   Well, we'll come back to Solr,
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.860]   but general other bang for your buck,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.700]   I'll throw one out.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.820]   In our last house,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.220]   maybe now's a good time to talk about energy monitoring.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.420]   We didn't have any sophisticated energy monitoring
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.220]   at my last condo except that PG&E,
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.100]   the electrical utility company, had smart meters,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.500]   and so you could buy something for relatively inexpensive,
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.800]   under $100, that would let you get streaming data
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.700]   from PG&E from your smart meter
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.500]   to see how your energy usage was going,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.460]   and we were like, "Gosh, why are we using so much energy?"
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.040]   So we just kind of went around the house,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.340]   totally unsophisticated,
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.580]   and we unplugged the fridge, plugged in the fridge,
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.820]   and then we turned off the lights,
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.180]   and we saw the electricity in the house drop in half,
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.860]   and we had these crazy halogen lights.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.380]   When we turned on the lights,
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.340]   the energy double or tripled,
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.820]   depending on how many rooms we're on,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.580]   and so we realized just replacing all these lights with LEDs
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.420]   cut our energy usage in half.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.980]   Now, we weren't using a ton of energy
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.780]   'cause keep in mind, Bay Area,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.180]   we didn't have air conditioning,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.260]   we weren't using a lot of heat,
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.100]   but for us, that was a big one.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.600]   - Is that something that is unique
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.360]   to whatever lights they put in this house,
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.840]   or is that a big savings option for people?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.320]   - That's a huge savings option for people.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.240]   I don't think people realize how much money
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.760]   they're spending on lighting.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.820]   You just don't think about it.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.360]   It's gonna sound like I'm making a horrible pun,
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.200]   but I'm not.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.440]   With knowledge comes power.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   Knowing how your energy is being used in your house,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.380]   just that alone is massive.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.600]   You talk about that device.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   One of the first devices I got was called a Sense,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.520]   where you installed it into an electric panel.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.960]   It cost like, I think when I got it,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.880]   it was a couple hundred bucks,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.440]   and it cost like $100 to have it installed,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.100]   so I think it was like $300 all in,
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.660]   and then it has, I'll say AI,
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.900]   that kind of is hit or miss,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.860]   but it kind of tries to identify things
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.700]   that it's detecting on your home.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.860]   It can figure out, oh, that's probably your HVAC system,
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.860]   that's probably your air conditioner,
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.940]   that's probably your microwave,
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.900]   and it can start to tell you your current use is this,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   and it will also tell you an always-on category,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.000]   that you're spending 350 watts constantly,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.180]   it's always running in the background.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.100]   When I found that out, I was like,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.940]   where the hell is that 350 watts going?
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.340]   Like, what is using all that energy?
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.040]   So it's the same thing, going around my house,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.140]   turning things off.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   There's a period where I would turn
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.140]   everything off in the house,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.340]   and I looked at it, okay, the house is down to five watts,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.740]   I don't know where that five watts is coming from,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   but it's five watts,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.460]   and it was like slowly turning things back on
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.640]   to figure out where that energy was coming from,
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.540]   and it was similar to you.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.940]   There was some lighting that was running
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.940]   that took more energy than we expected,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.060]   'cause it wasn't LED.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.420]   There was a dehumidifier at one point
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.900]   that we discovered was running rogue.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   We thought it was on a schedule that was running
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.580]   in our garage, which got in the damp.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.100]   We thought it was only running a few hours a day,
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.040]   but it turned out it was running like 12 hours a day,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.900]   overnight, and we were asleep, and we didn't know it,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.000]   and so it was like wasting gobs of electricity.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.440]   When you know where the energy use is going in your house,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.800]   it can be huge, and you don't have to spend hundreds.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.720]   You can get a device called a kilowatt.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.520]   You can buy 'em on Amazon for like 25 bucks,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.320]   and it's basically just one side's got the prongs,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.360]   you put it into an outlet,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.420]   and then the other side, you plug something into it,
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.240]   and it will show you exactly how many watts
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.640]   that thing you plugged in is using.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.120]   So if you're curious how much a lamp is using,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.560]   you can literally plug your lamp into this,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.400]   plug it into the wall,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.440]   and then you can monitor how much energy it's using
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.720]   over the next 24 hours, and then determine,
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.300]   wow, I could save some money by changing that lamp out
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.140]   or that bulb out.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.300]   So there's some very affordable ways
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.260]   to track this stuff down.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.300]   We moved into this house.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.620]   The previous owner installed a sense system and left it,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.980]   and on the downside,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.100]   that always-on category gives you no data.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.780]   So I don't know where it's coming from, what it's doing,
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.940]   but I could go turn off a lamp,
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.100]   and maybe a lamp's not enough to get a good sense
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.920]   of whether it's having a huge impact,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.600]   but I can certainly turn on all the lights off,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.120]   turn all the lights on, turn on the furnace,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.740]   turn off the furnace, run the oven.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.780]   This house, for some reason,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.420]   has two ovens and a countertop oven.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.700]   It's like, which oven is actually the most expensive?
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.420]   And I always thought it was one, and I was totally wrong.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.640]   We tested these two ovens.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.560]   Two of them were electric, and we were like, wow,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.260]   one of them is actually much more efficient.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.660]   I haven't gotten to the point to monitor gas usage
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.860]   to tell whether the oven,
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.700]   the gas or the electric oven is cheaper,
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.020]   so that's like a level two game that I haven't played,
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.580]   but I was blown away testing a lot of things.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.820]   I've always heard, oh, you know, you leave the TV plugged in,
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.020]   you leave the computer plugged in.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.340]   Even if they're off, they're still draining energy.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.900]   While that might be true,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.860]   is that really where people should focus their time
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.900]   and energy, or is it really about finding the major things
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.100]   that are causing drain?
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.140]   It's the major things.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.460]   It's like, you want to hit the low hanging fruit.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.620]   Like I mentioned my dehumidifier.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.700]   When we figured that out, it was like, wow,
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.420]   we saw our energy use decrease by 20%
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.100]   just by making that one tweak.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.580]   When you're talking about a television set,
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.260]   it might be pulling two, three watts.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.220]   It does matter, but if you have multiple TVs
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.540]   and multiple game consoles and things like that,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.020]   they're all sucking two, three, five watts.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.020]   It does add up, but that's not where I would start at all.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.860]   It's not going to make a huge dent.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.140]   There's like diminishing returns,
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.980]   and that's when you start to get to that lower tier
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.340]   is around that point.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.180]   And what about better appliances,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.940]   like switching from a 20-year-old electric washer/dryer
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.980]   to a new one or refrigerators or dishwashers?
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.220]   Is that a huge opportunity to save?
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.980]   Yes, 100%.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.380]   Especially, like I mentioned, heat pump all the things.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.620]   In our new house, we got a heat pump close dryer,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.380]   which uses way less electricity than our previous dryer did.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.860]   It's night and day how much power this thing uses.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.900]   Way less than half.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.300]   There's so many different things you can get with it.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.260]   The Energy Star certificates here in the US,
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.460]   there's usually a yellow sticker on every appliance
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.820]   that gives you an estimate as to how much it will cost you
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.660]   over the course of a year.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.900]   You have to take those with a grain of salt,
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.820]   but at least it's an apples-to-apples comparison
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.180]   between appliances, and there's huge differences
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.460]   between refrigerators and washing machines
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.560]   and things that you can get that way.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.780]   So you definitely want to pay attention to those stickers,
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.420]   get the most energy-efficient appliance you can.
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.060]   And is there a rule of thumb or just a general principle
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.740]   on gas versus electric?
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.460]   I know it's probably very dependent
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.100]   on where you live and rates,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.740]   but if someone's out there deciding,
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.380]   do I want an electric heat pump or gas dryer?
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.940]   Sounds like heat pump's probably the way to go,
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.420]   but let's set that aside and go with the two standard,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.060]   electric or gas dryer.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.740]   How would you think about that decision?
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.380]   That's a tough one because gas tends to be crazy cheap.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.060]   If you're just looking at dollars,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.220]   it depends on where you live
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.500]   and what your electricity rates are.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.260]   Gas may just win hands down,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.540]   but I would say 99% of the time,
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.740]   electric would end up being your best bet
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.940]   for something like a clothes dryer,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.300]   even a non-heat pump version,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.700]   just because they tend to be safer.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.540]   That's another thing.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.940]   Fire, clothing, lint, doesn't go well together,
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.860]   but electric tends to be, I would say,
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.660]   the better bet depending which way you're going.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.420]   And we talked about heating and cooling the house,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.660]   but what about heating and cooling the water in the house?
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.700]   I guess just heating.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.780]   We don't really cool our water.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.980]   Yeah. (laughs)
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.820]   On that, again, it's the same thing with the gas prices,
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.660]   things like that.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.820]   Depends on where you live.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.660]   In my area, going electric,
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.180]   again, heat pump, all the things,
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.740]   heat pump, water heaters,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.380]   300% efficient for every unit of energy you put in
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.380]   with what you get out.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.780]   Stuff like that, you can easily save money
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.220]   with an electric system over a gas system.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.660]   But if you're talking just a plain old electric,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.980]   non-heat pump version,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.900]   it still might be in your favor to go gas.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.220]   But again, safety, you still have toxic fumes
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.500]   that can potentially leak into your house.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.980]   So there's health considerations
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.540]   when you're talking about gas inside your house
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.620]   that you want to take into account.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.860]   But for most of it, I would say it's a heat pump,
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.620]   water heater would definitely be the winner.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.740]   - And are those tankless
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   or is it kind of two by two matrix?
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.860]   'Cause in my mind, it was like,
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.860]   you could go with electric tankless or tank and gas,
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.100]   but I guess I never processed
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.060]   that maybe there were two other options.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.940]   There's other options.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.580]   They're often called hybrid water heaters.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.420]   I have a Rheem heat pump water heater.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   It looks like any water heater you would have seen,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.660]   just a big old tank,
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.660]   but it seems to have a little hat on top of it.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.580]   It goes a little taller.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.460]   That taller portion is the heat pump
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.740]   just sitting on top of the tank.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.580]   That's all it is.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.260]   And a resistant element inside the water heater,
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.740]   just like a regular electric water heater,
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.100]   is kind of a hybrid mode.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.980]   And you can also get heat pump systems
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.500]   that are also natural gas.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.980]   So these hybrid systems can tap into gas or electric
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.100]   with the heat pump hat on top of it.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.740]   So there's a lot of options you can look at.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.100]   They tend to be more expensive
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.940]   than just straight up gas or straight up electric.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.260]   But when you're talking about over the course of 10 years,
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.660]   they're gonna come out ahead for sure.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.780]   But you still have a tank.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.300]   Yes, I still have a 40 gallon tank
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.140]   with that little heat pump hat on top of it.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.900]   And then to complicate matters for my new house,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.860]   it's actually tied into my geothermal system.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.980]   So my heating and cooling system,
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.460]   when a compressor is running,
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.980]   it's generating heat from the compressor itself.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.300]   So what the system does is it captures that waste heat
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.740]   from the HVAC system and pumps that over
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   into what's called the desuperheater tank
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.820]   and basically creates free hot water for me.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.260]   And then that desuperheater tank
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.420]   feeds into a regular water heater tank.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.620]   So I actually have two tanks in my mechanical room.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.820]   One's the desuperheater tank
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.700]   that feeds into this heat pump water heater.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.260]   And so the combination of the desuperheater,
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.660]   which produces roughly half of your hot water needs,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.500]   essentially for free,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.380]   tied into a heat pump water heater,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.860]   which is 300% efficient,
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.100]   it's like all of that stuff ties in together.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.540]   The amount of money I'll be spending
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.100]   on my hot water in my house,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.460]   the estimate is no joke,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.740]   50 bucks a year or something like that.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.820]   It's something crazy low
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.260]   that I may be spending on hot water.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.460]   I think now's a good time to tell everyone,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.940]   if anyone wants to go a little bit deeper
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.380]   on any one of these topics,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.500]   I'm pretty sure you have a video
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.620]   on every single one of them on the YouTube channel
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.300]   and then a conversation that ensues on the podcast.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.740]   So I'll just flag that for anyone here
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.580]   that if you're like,
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.340]   "Oh, I wanna know more about this heat pump water heater."
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.860]   I'm pretty sure you've made a video about it
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.900]   because I think I watched it.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.860]   And so there's a lot more to get there.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.540]   A couple more last things here.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.980]   So I read this thing that the Department of Energy said,
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.340]   which was that if you replace your filters regularly
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.340]   on your air conditioner,
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.980]   it could save your energy consumption
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.860]   anywhere from five to 15%.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.500]   That seems like first step.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.580]   Wow, just filters, cut your energy by five to 15%.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.940]   Seems kind of crazy.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.420]   I have not heard that stat, that's new to me,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.660]   but it makes sense because the older a filter gets,
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.620]   it gets filled up with lint and dust
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.580]   and becomes less efficient.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.900]   So the system has to work harder to move air through it.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.460]   So it does make sense that if you change that frequently,
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.780]   the air is gonna move more freely,
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.340]   which means less energy use.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.060]   It makes sense, I could totally see it being 15%.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.540]   And are you regularly changing filters?
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.140]   'Cause I imagine there's gotta be at least
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.820]   a decent number of people listening that are like,
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.860]   "I haven't changed my filter in five years."
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.620]   For me, my motivation for change, I have really bad allergies.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.780]   We change the filters on the set schedule
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.620]   that we're supposed to do.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.020]   It's like every six months or a year,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.620]   you're supposed to be changing filters out.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.660]   Maybe it's every three to six.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.700]   For others, we're always living by that,
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.620]   mainly because of my allergy problems.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.780]   So I've been a beneficiary of that savings
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.900]   and I didn't realize it.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.100]   The other hack I have here,
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.780]   and then if you have any other little ones,
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.020]   is that there are a lot of people
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.740]   that leave their water heater too hot.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.180]   And the first time that most people realize this
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.260]   is when you have children
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.860]   and one of the recommendations they have,
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.660]   "Oh, you have kids? Turn down your water heater."
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.620]   And I just realized that there are some people
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.260]   that to get to the hottest temperature they ever need,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.060]   it's 100%. And for some people,
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.100]   it's to get to the hottest temperature, it's like 70%.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.940]   So if your shower and sink and everything
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.860]   go way hotter than you ever need,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.980]   then you're probably spending energy,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.380]   whether that's electricity or gas,
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.660]   you're spending energy to heat that tank up so much
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.020]   and then not using as much of it as you need,
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.100]   you're probably overspending.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.460]   So I'd say dial it back until you maybe have gotten too far
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.380]   and then you can bring it up.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.300]   I remember as a kid,
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.540]   when we were leaving for a trip for a week or two,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.140]   we would dial the hot water heater
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.740]   all the way back to nothing
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.500]   and then turn it back on when we got home.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.740]   And so that was like one of the home energy hacks.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.460]   Now, you've got away mode on your Nest,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.660]   which makes that easy,
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.140]   but you can also turn back the temperature
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:00.980]   on your water heater.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.660]   - That's a really smart recommendation.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.300]   On top of which, some of these new water heaters,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.700]   like the one I just got from Reem,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.660]   it has a smart app that you can install to it and check it.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.140]   And it will tell you how many kilowatts
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.340]   you're using on your hot water.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.340]   So you can gamify it that same way,
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.300]   adjusting the temperature,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.060]   seeing how it affects the hot water spend you're doing.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.300]   But it also has a vacation mode on it.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.980]   I've never seen this on a water heater before
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.420]   where I'm going on a trip for two weeks,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.580]   I could do exactly what you're talking about,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.580]   put it into vacation mode
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.900]   and it dials the temperature way back to save you energy.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.220]   This stuff is getting crazy.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.860]   Is there any way to monitor like smart monitoring for gas?
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.900]   I have not come across one, honestly.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.020]   Everything I've come across,
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.620]   I've found add-ons you can put onto water heaters
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.340]   so that you can monitor your water.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.260]   I had a gas water heater and it could tell me
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.460]   how much gas I was using on that water heater,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.300]   but I've never seen one that you could add
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.180]   to see how much your whole house is using
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.740]   and where it's going and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.700]   I've never seen that.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.260]   I wish there was one, that would be nice.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.660]   I have seen on water,
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.860]   there's a flume is one device that my brother-in-law has
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.020]   that just monitors how much water is using,
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.420]   which in his case, there was a leak somewhere
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.740]   and he got alerted to it
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.780]   and it would have cost hundreds of dollars
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.180]   and he got an alert and he figured it out quickly.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.980]   So sometimes those systems are great as well.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.980]   I used a fin, it's just like the flume.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.020]   There's a fin in my old house,
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.580]   I'm gonna have a fin in my new house as well.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   It hasn't been installed yet,
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.140]   but it's fantastic to be able to know exactly
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.140]   how much water you're using
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.020]   and it can detect even just a slow drip
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.660]   that's coming from something in your house
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.740]   and alert you to that.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.460]   It can save you a lot of money, for sure.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.500]   - We'd be remiss if we talked about all this monitoring.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.260]   One of the things we were considering installing
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.660]   was a span, which if you wanna take sense to the next level,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.060]   you can replace your entire circuit panel
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.940]   and get a per circuit level monitoring,
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.180]   which I think you've done.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.180]   Is that really just the creme de la creme
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.980]   of home energy monitoring?
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.820]   - It is.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.460]   The argument of if it's necessary or not comes up a lot
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.100]   because it is a costly venture
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.140]   to put one of these things in,
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.380]   but we talked about the sense,
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.540]   it gives you the information,
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.540]   but it's up to you to really make the decisions
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.860]   or to track things down,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.300]   where when you have per circuit monitoring,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.140]   it's not just more granular,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.220]   but you can also set up automations
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.300]   and turn specific circuits on and off,
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.860]   depending on what's going on in your home.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   So these electric panels that are smart
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.420]   can actually take it to the next step
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.860]   and be proactive in how they're reacting
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.020]   to what's going on in your house,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.300]   where the sense is just information that you're getting.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.740]   - It was really interesting to see,
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.660]   and this dovetails nicely to where I want to go,
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.700]   that if we have solar and we have a battery,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.260]   if all of a sudden you lose power,
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.460]   Spann would go in and say,
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.060]   let's turn all these things off
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.900]   to make sure your battery and your solar
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.340]   can get you as far as possible.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.940]   And little things like the circuit breaker flip
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.980]   that I can go change it,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.580]   or I want to turn something off remotely
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.180]   and fix it and turn it back on.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.260]   I just want someone to come and actually label them.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.700]   Our hundred-year-old house circuits are so mislabeled
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.940]   that I actually have no idea what about half of them are.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.020]   And we've tried going around the house
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.900]   to figure out what they are, and I have no idea.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.100]   So if there is a service where someone will just come out
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.020]   and figure out what they are, I would love it.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.260]   - Have you done that thing where one person's in the room
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.420]   and the other person's at the panel
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.580]   and you're like yelling at each other
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.420]   or talking over the phone,
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.620]   I'm like, okay, I turned it off.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.460]   Did it go off?
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.740]   No, okay, try a different one.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.060]   - And we even bought this thing
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.740]   that you like plug into an outlet
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.540]   and you just run this thing along the sort of wall
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.860]   and it'll beep when it's there, but it's not very accurate.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.420]   And so we have some ways to go,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.780]   but that dovetails nice.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.660]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.300]   but I am back into it now.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.780]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.020]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.260]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.660]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.260]   which I think is Viore,
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.100]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.340]   for this episode.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.500]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.380]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.660]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.260]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.220]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.300]   But it's not just for men.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.540]   My wife is obsessed with Viore as much as I am.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.700]   While my personal favorite
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.100]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.620]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.020]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.100]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.740]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time I went on a run,
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.980]   bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.460]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.740]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.860]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.740]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.020]   or they even have a few things
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.700]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.500]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.860]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.380]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.140]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans,
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.220]   you most likely have money anxiety.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.940]   In fact, that is one of the reasons
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.180]   I started a financial planning firm back in 2016.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.700]   And when we shut the company down,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.380]   we did extensive research on the financial service company
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.340]   we wanted to recommend to our clients,
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.980]   and we landed on Facet,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.860]   and I'm excited they're sponsoring today's episode.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.140]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry on its head,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.780]   making financial planning accessible to everyone,
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.540]   not just the most wealthy.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.620]   And one of the things I hated about this industry
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.500]   is that so many financial advisors
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.260]   charge based on a high percentage of your assets,
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.220]   but not Facet.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.420]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.300]   which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.460]   And they match you with your own CFP professional
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.460]   who uses industry-leading technology
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.300]   and is backed by a team of experts
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.820]   across investments, taxes, and more.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.220]   So tackle the uncertainty you're feeling about your finances
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.380]   and replace it with some real confidence about your money.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.020]   Go to allthehacks.com/facet, that's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.900]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way,
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.700]   and they'll even waive the $250 enrollment fee
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.740]   for all of you.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.500]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet, F-A-C-E-T.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.580]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.060]   Facet Wealth is an SEC-registered investment advisor.

[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.740]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.940]   So one way to save money on energy is to reduce your usage.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.420]   We talked briefly, another one is to dial in
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.420]   at your rate plan to match your usage,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   but a whole other one is to just produce your own energy.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.620]   So I moved into a home with solar,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.180]   so I didn't have to make a decision,
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.620]   but you've had to make that decision.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.820]   So how do you think about when it makes sense
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.660]   to produce your own energy?
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.580]   Maybe there's another option.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.300]   I remember there was this one house in San Francisco
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.780]   that had a wind turbine on the roof,
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.420]   but how do you think about solar as an option
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.700]   and when it makes sense?
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.660]   I've done this twice now.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.980]   I did it on my old house and I did it on this house.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.900]   The solar just got installed a week and a half ago
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.740]   on my new house.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.340]   It's still not turned on yet, but the way I look at it
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.300]   is you have to have a clear set of goals that you want to do.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.340]   What are your goals?
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.780]   Are you just looking to save money on your energy bill,
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.620]   come out ahead?
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.220]   Are you concerned about climate change?
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.660]   Are you looking for energy security
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.980]   because power goes out in your neighborhood
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.260]   several times a year because there's big storms
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.980]   that come through and knock down power lines?
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.660]   What is it that you're trying to solve for?
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.260]   And once you have that criteria,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.940]   it becomes very easy to decide
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.300]   if solar is right for you or not.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   Kind of what I said earlier,
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.860]   I can't say everybody should go solar
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.740]   because it may not fit your goals.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.340]   For like me in my personal situation,
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.700]   I was looking for energy security
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.860]   and to save some money over the long term.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.500]   I wasn't looking for a short-term goal for saving money.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.780]   But in my areas where I live here in Massachusetts,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.380]   we get ice storms that come through,
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.380]   bad storms in the winter
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.460]   that sometimes knock out power lines.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.260]   We haven't had the closing yet in the old house,
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.860]   but I still have the span in my old house.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.140]   And I got a notification yesterday
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.580]   'cause it was a hurricane Lee
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.580]   just came up the East Coast of the United States
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.620]   and took out power for where my old house is.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.100]   And I got the notification from span saying,
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.180]   "Hey, your house is on backup right now.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.700]   Here's how long it will last given its current use."
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.660]   And since there's nobody there,
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.980]   it'll last for two and a half days.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.860]   So it didn't really matter.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.420]   You wanna get solar if those are your goals.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.700]   And it's really easy to calculate
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.100]   what size of system you need to do
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.140]   based on those goals, how much you wanna save.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.100]   You can just dial it in based on your budget,
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.940]   how much energy you're trying to knock down.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.100]   It's pretty easy to figure it out
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.540]   once you've got those goals listed up.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.300]   - Can financing be a good option to defer that cost
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.140]   or make the ROI happen earlier?
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.980]   I never really understood whether solar financing
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.740]   was predatory or helpful.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.700]   - It is predatory.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.460]   There's basically three main ways.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.380]   You're paying for cash, you're getting a loan,
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.900]   or you're doing some kind of lease.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.620]   And it's when you get into the lease territory
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.420]   where it becomes very predatory.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.540]   And it really depends on what business you're talking to
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.580]   and what they're trying to push.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.700]   I do not recommend leases at all
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.620]   because what ends up happening
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.900]   is they put a lien in your home.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.700]   If you need to sell your house and move away,
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   you have to figure that out.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.740]   You're either gonna have to pay
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.020]   to have the solar panels removed
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.260]   if the new owner doesn't want them
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.660]   or the new owner has to basically
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.140]   take that lease over from you.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.940]   And not a lot of buyers that are buying a house
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.140]   necessarily wanna do that.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.100]   So it can kind of put you into a very bad position.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.820]   Or if you have a loan or paid cash,
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.740]   it doesn't have that same onus on you.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.580]   If you have a loan, when you go to sell your house,
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.420]   you can use the proceeds from the sale of the house
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.260]   to pay off the loan so that the new homeowner
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.820]   doesn't have to do anything when they come in.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.860]   So those are the ways I would recommend doing it.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.180]   But the fastest way for payoff is with cash,
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.900]   which of course, very expensive, hard to do.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.940]   There's a lot of loans out there
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.260]   that have very low interest rates.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.700]   A lot of states across the country have programs
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.780]   that can help you find extremely low interest rate loans
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.140]   to help you cover the costs.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.260]   So there are ways to find very good financing for it.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.660]   - And we mentioned earlier some of the programs
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.100]   that'll come in and evaluate your home.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.460]   There are also a ton of rebates and incentives
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.580]   for lower cost appliances.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.340]   I think we got our Rachio, which is a water irrigation system.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.060]   It was free from the county based on the fact
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.900]   that it helps your home.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.300]   So I'll just replug that.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.660]   Make sure you go look at your utility site,
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.140]   your county site, and see what programs there are.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.100]   'Cause there's a lot of stuff,
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.580]   whether it's low interest loans or devices
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.340]   or discounts that you can get.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.740]   How did you like that device?
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.020]   How did it work out for you?
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.180]   - So we have a drip irrigation system
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.020]   and we just replaced whatever that company is
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.660]   that everyone seems to have, Rain Something, with Rachio.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.780]   And it's really nice.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.780]   You can walk around the yard,
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.180]   especially when you're trying to test something
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.540]   and you just open the app and say run zone four.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.380]   And then you're like, oh,
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.340]   that's why there's water on our patio in the morning.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.160]   It's right here.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.980]   I don't think it's functionally that different,
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.860]   but when we were talking to someone
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.420]   who was helping put in a couple trees 'cause some died,
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.500]   we were able to figure out, okay, well, let's run this.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.700]   Let's see if it's getting too much.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.300]   Let's dial it back to 10 minutes instead of 15 minutes.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.900]   And it was just a lot easier than going to a machine
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.340]   and turning a dial on how often it runs on each zone.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.180]   So I thought it was great.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.660]   I wouldn't say it's changed our lives.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.400]   I think a lot of the smart home stuff, which we'll get to,
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.100]   the benefits of it are that you don't have to think about it
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.980]   as opposed to something you use every day.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.460]   - I was asking 'cause I've heard that's a good way
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.020]   to save on water usage.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.620]   So it makes sense that they'd be offering it to you for free
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.900]   'cause it can really help cut down
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.060]   on how much water is getting used,
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.420]   especially in an area where water
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.180]   might be a very scarce thing.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.420]   - It's especially good because it's like, oh, it rained.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.540]   We're not gonna run irrigation.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.740]   And that is the big feature that the city loves
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.100]   is you're not gonna be using water when there's rain,
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.460]   which a system that was based off dials
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.220]   would obviously just not have any knowledge of the rain
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.340]   and it would just keep running.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.060]   - And on that really quick, it's like your call out
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.220]   to talking to utilities.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.620]   When I was just in Vancouver, the utility up there,
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.180]   they give you a device that's like that Sense Energy Monitor
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.020]   for free.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.060]   And when you log into your utility account,
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.440]   it shows you live monitoring.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.780]   It shows you how it's breaking down,
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.620]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.220]   This stuff doesn't just benefit you.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.260]   It benefits the utility, which is why a lot of these places
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.860]   are offering these systems for free.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.900]   When it comes to solar,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.060]   there are government tax credits that you get
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.900]   and a lot of things.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.720]   I'm not an expert there.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.220]   You might be, you went through the process,
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.820]   but we already had it when we moved in.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.060]   So we didn't have to think about it.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.300]   Well, it depends on where you live.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.220]   California is of course, sun country.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.220]   You guys had the best programs for years.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.540]   Massachusetts is actually not that far behind California
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.860]   as far as what the incentives were.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.300]   So there's some decent incentives
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.820]   that you can get to knock off the cost
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.580]   of what the system will be out of pocket.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.500]   And then there's the federal tax rebate that you can get,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.540]   which knocks 30% off how much you owe
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.940]   on your taxes that you can claim.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.560]   So when you're talking about installing a system
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.780]   that's $30,000, you're knocking $10,000 right off the bat
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.980]   'cause of the federal tax credit.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.860]   And then my state knocks another 7,000 off of that.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.820]   So before you know it,
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.620]   the cost of the system just got way more affordable.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.700]   So that loan we talked about is much smaller
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.540]   at the end of the day.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.340]   There's a lot of beneficial programs out there,
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.700]   but it varies state to state.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.380]   Some states offer nothing, absolutely nothing.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.820]   So it really depends on where you live.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.820]   - Did you pair, I'm assuming you did,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.580]   your solar system with a battery?
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.420]   - Oh yeah.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.780]   I'm personally a believer in solar and batteries
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.940]   are like peanut butter and chocolate.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.820]   They go together so well, you gotta have them both.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.560]   - We have a Tesla Powerwall and it's great.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.020]   Power goes off, you're protected.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.140]   But it's also great because you can collect energy.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.680]   Even if you don't collect it from the sun,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.980]   you can collect it during off-peak hours.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.940]   So for us, we have these three different prices.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.500]   We never pay for anything other than the lowest price
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   because we're either producing it from solar
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.380]   or we've stored it on the battery.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.020]   Now at 11.59 p.m. is the battery drained enough
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.460]   that if something were to happen and the power went out,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.020]   we wouldn't have a full battery, yes.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.600]   It's kind of a risk we're willing to take,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.260]   but the battery's really helpful
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.220]   to shave that peak cost off.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.980]   - But do you have power going out that much?
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.660]   - No, we don't, but there are a lot of places
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.980]   where that's the risk is if your power goes out
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.940]   and your battery's low because you were using it
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.340]   to collect cheaper energy, that would be the problem.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.620]   And to fix that, I guess you could have two batteries
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.900]   or just not worry about it.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   - Or in the case of the Tesla,
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.500]   'cause I had a Tesla Powerwall in my old house,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.860]   when a weather alert comes out,
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.260]   the system automatically charges itself up.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.920]   So it's like if you had time of use rates
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.980]   and there was a weather alert,
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.620]   the weather alert would override the time of use rates
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.060]   to make sure that you have enough power
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.100]   for that power outage that might happen
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.520]   because a big storm's coming up.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.820]   - And how do you generally think about that?
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.460]   We've got Tesla Powerwalls, Tesla solar roofs.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.300]   What do you think?
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.900]   It sounds like you don't have either of those
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.940]   in this new house.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.520]   - No, I went with a different brand.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.620]   We went with Enphase, which is a major solar company.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.980]   They have their own battery system.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.860]   We had an Enphase solar at the old house
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.920]   with a Tesla Powerwall.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.100]   This house is Enphase solar with an Enphase battery system.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.300]   And part of the reason I did that,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.100]   not solar, Tesla Powerwall,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.720]   because of the integration between the battery system
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.220]   and the solar system,
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.580]   the way they integrate with each other is pretty cool
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.700]   and very sophisticated.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.020]   So I wanted to go that route.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.380]   It also meant that we didn't need to get as much battery
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.860]   as we might need to otherwise,
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.420]   because tying back to the span,
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.860]   there's all these benefits that you can get
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.640]   where if you have smart energy monitoring
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.340]   that can control how energy is being used and when,
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.100]   and then these smart systems between the solar
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.300]   and the battery, the way they work.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.620]   It doesn't mean that you need 40 kilowatt hours of storage.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.260]   You might only need 20 because it's very smart
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.580]   and intelligent about how it uses the energy storage,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.780]   which saves you money.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.060]   You may be spending $7,000 or something on the span panel,
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.760]   but you're saving $15,000
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.060]   'cause you don't need as many batteries.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.780]   The way I'm thinking about this now is I have a friend
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.820]   who is thinking about getting solar right now.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.000]   And he was telling me how much solar he needed.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.300]   And I was like, whoa, now I'm thinking,
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.420]   before you go through the process of solar or batteries,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.260]   go through everything we talked about before.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.060]   Whether you wanna upgrade your heating system,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.900]   whether you wanna start replacing your light bulbs,
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.180]   go through the process to dial in how much energy
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.260]   your home needs and bring that down as much
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.660]   before you jump into the process
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.420]   of how many panels do I need or how big of a battery
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.980]   do I need to support the house.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.800]   - Yeah, you nailed it.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.900]   I've had people come to me and say,
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.740]   "Hey man, I'm looking to get this solar panel system."
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.780]   And they live in a large house.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.180]   They share the plan with me.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.180]   And it's something like a 30 kilowatt solar panel system
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.300]   is bonkers huge.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.100]   Well, how much energy are you using?
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.160]   We have two EVs and we have all this stuff.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.660]   Well, you know, if you replaced all this stuff,
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.860]   you could probably cut your energy use down by 30%,
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.780]   which means you need a smaller solar panel system.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.420]   You absolutely are right.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.300]   You need to start with trying to figure out
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.900]   exactly how much you can reduce your energy use.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.840]   And then that's the number you're trying to achieve.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.100]   Is there anything on the horizon
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.980]   or stuff that's come out really recently
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.820]   that's worth bringing up?
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.940]   'Cause I used to stay on top of tech stuff,
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.100]   but not energy stuff.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.700]   Is there like some new technology or product
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.220]   or something that you're really excited about
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.220]   in the next few years?
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.740]   There's a few really cool things.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.820]   One of which is going back to water heaters.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.760]   There is something called phase change materials
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.620]   that are basically thermal batteries.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.820]   You put energy into it, it changes the material.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.780]   Think about like water goes through a phase change
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.900]   when it goes, turns into steam.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.940]   So you have a phase change material like it's like a wax.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:57.980]   So it's kind of like a solid
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.460]   and then it becomes this soft liquidy material.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.460]   It almost looks like the size of instant water heaters,
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.580]   a small little box.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.980]   And it's made by a company called Sunamp.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.340]   You basically have an electric resistive heater inside of it
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.700]   that charges the battery.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.020]   And then when you need hot water,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.180]   cold water just passes through some tubes,
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.740]   the phase change material and it heats up,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.580]   you got hot water.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.900]   And it's crazy efficient.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.600]   And that's just hitting the US market now.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.440]   It's been in Europe,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.980]   but it's just hitting the market here now.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.740]   Another one is new battery tech
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.980]   that's gonna make home batteries cheaper and last longer.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.200]   There's something called a flow battery.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.940]   There's a company that's trying to bring this flow battery
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.140]   to market that would be about the size
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.100]   of a small refrigerator.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.700]   You could just drop off the back of your house.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.420]   It's 40 kilowatt hours of storage
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.260]   and it would be price competitive to,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.820]   I think they said a single power wall
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.700]   and it's got dramatically more storage
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.540]   and a flow battery can last you decades.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.140]   So you'd never have to change this battery.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.280]   You'd buy it and it would work for you
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.380]   for the next 20, 30 years.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.380]   Where a power wall is gonna probably hit end of life
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.420]   after a decade or need to be swapped out.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.180]   - I've also heard that one of the cheapest home batteries
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.460]   out there is the Ford F-150 Lightning.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.820]   (laughing)
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.140]   You can power your house off that thing
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.660]   for like a week or something ridiculous
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.260]   'cause the battery pack is so big.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.460]   - Well, someone did a comparison.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.100]   They said to get the battery capacity
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.580]   of the Ford F-150 in Tesla power walls,
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.980]   you'd spend more than you would with the Ford F-150.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.260]   You also get a truck.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.180]   You get more battery charging for a less cost and a truck.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.540]   I have at least one friend who I'm in this group
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.100]   of kind of nerdy tech dads.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.380]   And he was like, "I think I'm just gonna buy a truck."
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.500]   He lives in a place where having an extra car
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.420]   is not a hassle.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.460]   And yes, you gotta register it and insure it
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.300]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.020]   But he was like, "I get a car and the batteries."
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.580]   And it ended up being a much better deal
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.340]   than adding on more power walls.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.940]   That's another piece of tech that I'm excited about.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.940]   It's called vehicle to grid or vehicle to load.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.260]   It's like when you have an EV
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.900]   that has bi-directional charging.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.740]   So when you plug it in, it can take power,
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.860]   but it can also give power.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.900]   It's like my Tesla Model 3 that I've got,
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.820]   it's the largest battery I have in my house.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.740]   It's a 60 something kilowatt hour battery.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.100]   If I could plug that into my house,
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.300]   I may not need a battery system like a power wall
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.420]   or an in-phase battery because you have so much
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.500]   in your car right there.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.700]   As a multi-Tesla owning family,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.260]   do you think that's something that can come to these cars
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.100]   without modification or is it gonna take a lot?
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.700]   That's a really good question.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.540]   I have no idea.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.900]   When it comes to Tesla specifically,
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.460]   they're the one company, they're the elephant in the room
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.780]   when it comes to vehicle to grid.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.260]   It's like every other EV company
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.780]   is starting to roll this stuff out.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.860]   They're the ones that are basically not doing it.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.020]   And part of the reason for that, I think,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.620]   is because they have the power wall
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.180]   and they don't wanna eat into that market.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.420]   But at some point they'll do it.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.180]   I have a feeling it's gonna require a hardware change.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.420]   So if you have an older Tesla,
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.940]   it may not be able to do this.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.380]   But on this note, the new iPhone 15s
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.180]   that have come out with USB-C ports
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.180]   now allow you to use your phone to charge your AirPods.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.580]   So Apple is doing this already also.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.860]   And speaking of Apple and technology and stuff,
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.820]   let's move a little bit.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:40.900]   Home energy savings.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.260]   We talked about saving energy.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.540]   We talked about producing your own.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   With an end goal of both security,
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.020]   but also hopefully some savings.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.340]   The next big category that I know you thought a lot about
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.020]   in your home is kind of the opposite.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.700]   It's usually where you end up spending more money
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.860]   than saving money.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.420]   It's all around smart home and home automation.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.940]   And I've gone down a lot of rabbit holes here
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.180]   in the past few years.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.900]   And I'm curious how you just broadly thought about
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.100]   a strategy because I've pieced mine together over time,
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.500]   but you just have a new home
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.460]   and you probably got the chance to think about
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.940]   every decision from the beginning.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.780]   How did you do that?
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.380]   - I was in the same boat in my old house.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.860]   It was such a piecemeal patchwork of insanity
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.540]   that it was so easy to break.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.700]   So when I was building this house,
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.860]   it was what are the things I'm trying to do?
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.620]   And what is the tech that will work together the best?
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.580]   And thankfully in the smart home market right now,
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.100]   there's a new system called Matter,
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.060]   which is this broadly used system across Google,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.140]   Apple, Amazon, everybody's bought into it.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.300]   So if you buy new smart home tech that is Matter certified,
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.100]   it will work with pretty much any system.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.260]   It works locally.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.780]   It's going to be very secure.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.420]   So if you're a privacy centric person
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.620]   that only wants locally controlled smart home tech,
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.260]   Matter devices can do that for you.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.660]   If you want to jump between Apple HomeKit
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.780]   or Google Home or Amazon,
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.740]   these devices will interoperate.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.980]   That's been one of the biggest problems up to this point.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.220]   So for my new house,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.860]   I was thinking along those lines of,
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.300]   I only want to get products
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.740]   that are really locally controlled,
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.260]   are Matter certified and kind of future-proofed
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.140]   and will work together.
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:04.140]   But I also wanted to make sure
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.180]   I was only getting things that had a purpose.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.860]   I'm not a big fan of, oh, I have a smart light
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.900]   that can turn red and green just because it can.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.380]   That kind of stuff is not what I was concerned with.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.060]   It was more about smart light switches
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.420]   that can turn rooms off
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.540]   if nobody's there for a certain period of time,
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.420]   stuff like that.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.660]   - Okay, and what is that light switch?
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.060]   'Cause when we moved into this house,
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.380]   we replaced all the light switches
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.780]   with Lutron Caseta lights,
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.420]   which at the time seemed like
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.420]   the best lighting automation system.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.340]   Certainly doesn't sense what's happening anywhere.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.860]   So that was one big change we made.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.620]   And fortunately, the previous homeowner
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.180]   had done a lot of hard wiring.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.940]   So we have a Ubiquiti Unify Wi-Fi system,
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.500]   including Unify cameras that are mostly run hardwired.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.780]   Those are the two big pieces,
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.180]   but I'm curious from your side,
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.620]   what were the components that you thought
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.180]   were actually useful and important in your system?
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.220]   - Well, the first one was light.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.180]   And we went with Lutron for the new house.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.380]   Lutron is the only smart home device I've ever used
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.900]   that has been rock solid, never had a problem,
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.820]   never failed in any way, shape or form.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.780]   It works with every system that's out there.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.020]   It is the cream of the crop as far as I'm concerned.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.980]   So when I moved in here,
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.980]   I got Lutron Caseta for all the switches
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.300]   'cause it ties into any system
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.140]   that I can basically automate things.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.900]   I'm using Apple Home as my base,
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.060]   but I may actually be shifting that,
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.380]   but I can set up automations for all this kind of stuff.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.060]   If nobody's home, lights go off.
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.380]   If it's this time of night, certain lights go off.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.900]   Room is empty for a certain period of time,
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.740]   lights can go off.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.620]   So it allows me to set up those automations
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.020]   in a rock solid way that just always works.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.940]   I feel great about my decision to do that
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.380]   'cause we have the same system.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.380]   I've got Ubiquiti Unify stuff everywhere too.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   'Cause again, it's the cream of the crop
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.140]   when you're talking about security cameras,
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.980]   Wi-Fi, setting up home networks.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.300]   It really is the best.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.660]   I can't think of the number of times in our last home
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.140]   I had to restart a router.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.700]   I think the advantage of Unify system
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.660]   is I have not restarted our router in over a year.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.220]   It might restart at night when no one's actively using it
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.180]   to upgrade the software, maybe that's happening,
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.220]   but it is so solid that I just haven't had
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:57.740]   to do any restarting or anything.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.220]   It's not the most consumer friendly to set up
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.660]   and I think they're getting better there,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.940]   but that's been solid.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.780]   And then almost every home internet plan is now unlimited.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.820]   So it doesn't really matter,
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.660]   but it is nice that all the cameras are local.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.740]   So we've just got a massive hard drive
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.300]   in our Dream Machine Pro, similar probably to what you have
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.500]   and you could still stream your cameras from anywhere,
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.460]   but you're not constantly using your bandwidth
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.020]   to stream nine cameras to the cloud
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.980]   and storing them on someone else's server,
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.100]   which just eats into your bandwidth use.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.820]   And on top of which is recording all the time.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.900]   So these Wi-Fi cameras can get super cheap.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:33.060]   You may miss the first 30 seconds of a motion event
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.100]   that was recorded because it took a while for the camera
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.340]   to realize something was happening before it recorded it,
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.620]   where the Ubiquiti stuff, it's just recording all the time.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.100]   So if you need to scroll back two minutes before an event,
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.500]   you can see exactly what's going on.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.740]   I feel like I bought into the top tier kind of stuff.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.220]   And if you have rogue devices
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.300]   that are using a lot of bandwidth,
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.700]   that's another thing I noticed is that
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.300]   the Dream Machine shows you per client.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.780]   So it shows how much bandwidth each thing is using.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.900]   So if you're trying to track down,
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.460]   why is my bandwidth so high?
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.540]   Oh, there's this one computer that I forgot was on
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.180]   and it's doing something crazy in the background.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.900]   You can track that kind of stuff down too.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.380]   The analytics are really interesting.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.540]   You could nerd out about it.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.660]   And I certainly have, I don't know if you have to.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.380]   What other platforms are you using?
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.060]   Are you doing things for locks?
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.420]   Yeah, I have Slage smart door locks
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.260]   that tie into my Apple HomeKit system.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.300]   I use Apple watches.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.980]   So it's like, we can just walk up to the door,
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.900]   put our watch to the door and the door opens.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.060]   Super nice to have.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.540]   I don't like carrying keys anymore.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.660]   This makes it super easy.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:24.780]   And we're focused on Apple Home
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.020]   'cause we're an Apple household,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.180]   but I'm looking at other systems like Home Assistant,
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.020]   which is a super geeky, nerdy, free open source system
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.660]   that you can get that I've been playing with,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.100]   not user-friendly compared to something like Apple,
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.460]   but it's very powerful and can do whatever you want.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.980]   And there's other systems coming online.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.660]   There's one called Homey from Europe
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.460]   that's just hitting the US market now
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.460]   that is crazy powerful and really easy to use.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.700]   It has a user interface that is fantastic.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.780]   It's great to see options like that hitting the market too.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.780]   My biggest piece of advice to anyone listening
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.500]   that likes to nerd out is unless you're 100% sure,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.340]   don't make your smart home and security system everything
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.740]   DIY 'cause it's fun.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.540]   Because I did this in our last home
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.460]   and we bought this device called Connected
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.820]   and we used all of the legacy security system,
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.900]   hardwired things, brought it online,
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.340]   tied it into smart things.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.820]   And we have basically a DIY home security system
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.580]   that tied into this third party that would monitor it.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.980]   But with your home security system,
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.180]   do you really want it to all be DIY
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.980]   and based off some scripts that you wrote about what to do?
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   And I thought it was so cool
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.260]   'cause it would allow you to pre-program something
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.380]   for your Sonos speakers to say if someone broke in
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.220]   and all this stuff.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.060]   But at the end of the day,
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.500]   I didn't trust that it was actually gonna work
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.260]   because I had put it all together myself
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.500]   and we switched to Ring
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.780]   and we're using Ring for home security, very happy.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.980]   But I hate that we have one platform for security,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.500]   a different platform for locks,
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.700]   a different platform for cameras.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.500]   And my question is, should I just get over that?
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.660]   And accept that if they all tie in to the same platform,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.420]   it doesn't really matter if your light switches
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.300]   and your plugs and your door locks are all different.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.420]   I would say, yeah, you need to get over it a little bit
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.020]   in the short term, but in the long term,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.660]   the thing I mentioned about Matter,
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.820]   that is going to slowly become the industry standard
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:06.860]   across everything.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.100]   So at some point, you'll be able to get some kind
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.260]   of security system like a Ring system as a paid service
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.660]   that you're getting that monitored for you kind of a thing.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.060]   And it would work with multiple platforms at once.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.660]   But yeah, you kind of have to get over it
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.020]   as long as it all ties into one central place,
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.260]   that's the most important thing.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.500]   So if you're a Google user
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.980]   and you want it to all go into Google
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.220]   so that on your phone, it's all in one location,
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:29.340]   all your cameras show up here,
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.940]   all your security stuff shows up in the app,
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.660]   even if it's Ring doing the security side,
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.020]   that's ultimately what's going to make it
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.980]   more user-friendly.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.580]   And I'd call out for me, the wife acceptance factor,
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.980]   the WAF, doing the DIY stuff is fun.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.740]   So I'm a geek, I like to nerd out and do that stuff.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.620]   But I had set up stuff on the old house
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   that if something broke, my wife could never fix it.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.100]   She would not know where to start.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.460]   And so it was all on me to fix it,
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.940]   which is the stuff I'm trying to avoid in this house.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.260]   I'm trying to get it set up in a way
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.900]   that she would be comfortable going in there
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.180]   and messing with automations and a user interface
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.820]   that's really easy to understand and use.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.100]   So you have to think about the other people
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.940]   in your house as well.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.780]   Otherwise, you're going to run into problems.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.900]   - There's one company that I thought was really interesting
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.340]   that we didn't end up using
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.180]   because we'd already wired all these cameras.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.700]   I don't know if you've seen Deep Sentinel.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.620]   - No, what's that?
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.940]   - So Deep Sentinel is a security platform.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.060]   The friends I know that have used it, love it.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.380]   It's similar to a home security system with cameras,
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.260]   except they have people that are live monitoring the cameras.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.100]   - Oh, wow.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.180]   - So someone walks up to your porch to take a package
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.100]   and someone on the speaker is live seeing motion
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.660]   and talking to the person without you there.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.540]   So it's almost as if you have a remote security manager.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.340]   You see all these movies where in some rich person's house,
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.620]   there's a room where a guy sits with all the cameras
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.500]   and is ready to go.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.700]   It's that, except that person's monitoring
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.820]   probably hundreds of homes from one share somewhere else.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.300]   And not just monitored, police will come,
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.220]   but person will be watching the cameras
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.900]   and be able to proactively do things,
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.860]   whether it's talk or call the authorities
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:55.780]   or something like that.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.020]   - Wow, that's kind of neat.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.140]   And there's also a little bit of a creepy factor to it
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.220]   to know that somebody is watching my cameras.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.420]   There's something a little odd about that,
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.780]   but that's also pretty cool.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.340]   That service, if it could plug into an existing set
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.820]   of cameras would be more interesting
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.300]   than buying a whole set of new cameras for the home
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.140]   for all this stuff.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.180]   Have you done a lot with smart home sensors
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.260]   just around the house to monitor different things,
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.420]   whether it's temperature, humidity, leaks,
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.300]   that kind of stuff?
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.060]   - Oh yeah, the house is so airtight
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.380]   that it needs something called an energy recovery ventilator
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.340]   that's always bringing in fresh outside air
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.780]   and exhausting stale inside air.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.500]   And as the two pass, it's recovering the heat between them.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.460]   So it keeps the energy inside the house,
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.980]   but it's giving you constant fresh air.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.220]   A concern with a system like that
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.060]   is humidity levels might get too high
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.860]   or CO2 levels might get kind of high.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.500]   So I've got sensors all over this house
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.300]   that are just monitoring temperature, humidity,
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.060]   and CO2 and particular matter, all that kind of stuff.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.180]   And I'm setting up automations in my house
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.660]   so that if CO2 levels get too high,
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.500]   the ERV will just ramp up a little bit
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.980]   just to make sure that air is changing as it needs to.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.320]   I definitely am in the sensor game,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.340]   got them all over the place.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:58.140]   And sensors for like if a door is open or closed.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.340]   Kind of freaked out the electricians
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.180]   that were here the other day,
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.180]   'cause they went to open the door to the mechanical room.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.780]   They opened the door and the light was on.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.860]   They were like, that's weird.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.980]   And they closed it and they noticed
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.340]   under the gap of the door, the light went off.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.620]   And then they stood there for a few minutes
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.380]   to open the door, closing the door, open the door,
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.300]   closing the door, and they didn't understand
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.140]   what was going on.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.340]   And I came around the corner and they were like,
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.260]   did you do something here?
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.460]   And I was like, yeah, there's a door sensor.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.260]   If you see over there, there's a little door sensor.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.380]   It's acting like a refrigerator.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.660]   The light comes automatically
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.240]   'cause the room's a dark cave.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.560]   You have to turn the light on.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.280]   So why not just automate it with a sensor?
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.600]   - And what did that automation,
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.520]   was that in Apple's home product?
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.760]   - Yeah, I bought a matter certified door sensor.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.080]   That's just this little door sensor
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.240]   so that it uses something called thread as its network
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.960]   and linked it directly in the home app.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.520]   And then I just set up an automation that said,
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.280]   if door open, turn light on.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.080]   If door closed, turn light off.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.480]   - And did that need another hub in your house
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.520]   for those sensors to work?
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.360]   - Nope.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.180]   - Super interesting.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.020]   I have a room that needs this.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.840]   It's like a dark room and the light switch
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.760]   is so poorly located that you have to reach around stuff.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.720]   So that's next.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.560]   But then I'm like, gosh,
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.120]   couldn't we just use the ring sensors
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.840]   that we have on all these doors already?
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.260]   But I think ring is private in that way.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.280]   Did you do anything for security in your house?
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.120]   - Not yet.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.680]   Because I'm Apple, I'm looking at a system called Abode,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.160]   which is similar to Ring,
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.000]   but it ties directly into Apple HomeKit.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.080]   So any sensors I would add could then show up in Apple Home
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.880]   and I could use them for different automations.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.840]   So that's part of the reason I'm looking at that system.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.580]   - For your UniFi system, you have UniFi cameras.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.040]   Did you tie them into Home using the third-party software
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.200]   that runs on a Raspberry Pi or something?
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.040]   - Yes.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.880]   There's multiple ways to bring them in.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.080]   There's a service called Scripted
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.560]   that you can run on a Raspberry Pi.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.680]   Home Assistant can do it.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.640]   HomeBridge can do it.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.560]   I have a network-attached storage device
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.280]   for all my video editing I'm doing.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.400]   And on that NAS, I'm running a version of HomeBridge
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.840]   that brings all of my protect cameras into Home.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.160]   So I have feeds of everything directly in the Apple app.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.040]   - I did that, but it was running on a computer
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.240]   and I just haven't made the leap
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.280]   to run it on a Raspberry Pi or something,
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.140]   'cause we don't have a NAS.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.000]   I was trying to run it on the Dream Machine.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.240]   There is a way to do it, and it seems possible,
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.280]   but I also don't want to mess with it.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.120]   - It's really hacky.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.560]   I looked at that, too, and I was like, there's no way.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.760]   I don't want to screw this system up.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.720]   It's working so well.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.840]   I'll do it somewhere else.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.760]   And so I had the NAS.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.800]   That's why I did it that way.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.920]   - Any other smart home things I'm forgetting
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.800]   that you've thought about in this new house?
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.840]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.760]   We've talked about water,
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.080]   the solar stuff with the span, the battery.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.720]   We've covered most of the major stuff.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.620]   Blinds?
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.460]   Oh, yes.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.280]   I'm doing Lutron Serena shades throughout my house.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.480]   The cost of the shades will never return on investment.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.000]   Let's take this with a grain of salt,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.520]   but I am gonna be using these shades
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.900]   with some automations to help reduce energy costs,
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.760]   because sun beaming in your house,
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.680]   if you're trying to keep it cool, warms the room.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.240]   So I'm gonna be setting up automations
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.440]   based on light level, time of day, stuff like that,
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.280]   temperature of the room,
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.280]   where it could automatically drop the shades halfway.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.480]   If it's close to sunset, keep a room from getting too hot.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.680]   I'll be doing stuff like that.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.520]   We bought Bali blinds through Costco,
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.440]   and they're kind of like a DIY setup,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:47.040]   and I can't explain why, but one of them just never works.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.360]   And it's never the same one.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.680]   So I can't say I support this system,
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.580]   but I think it was probably a third of the cost
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.940]   of the Serena shades.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.060]   So if you're okay that maybe one shade
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.720]   doesn't work sometimes, it could be a good way to save.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.360]   But I will say that we have it on automations.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.740]   Right now we're on Google Home,
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.040]   and it'll just drop the shades in the morning.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.240]   I think you can even time shift it from sunrise and sunset,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.120]   so you don't have to constantly change the schedule.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.800]   Raise the shades on one side of the house,
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.980]   drop the shades on the other.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.520]   It's not quite smart enough to know seasonally
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.280]   where is the sun in the morning, right?
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.400]   In half the year, it's coming from one side of the house,
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.920]   half the year it's on the other, but it's pretty good.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.200]   That comes back to the sensors.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.800]   Some of these motion sensors also are light sensors.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.040]   So if they're detecting the lumens of the room,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.840]   you can say if the light level is higher than this,
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:31.880]   drop the shades.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.400]   So you can set it that way to give it a little more smarts.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.880]   And I would also call out IKEA
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.760]   has some really cheap smart shades.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.360]   The company Eve also has their version of smart shades
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   that are much cheaper than Serena.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.560]   The Lutron Serena is the most expensive,
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.000]   but I went with them because just like the light switches,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.800]   rock solid, they always work.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.160]   There's never an issue with them.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.840]   They get kind of the highest marks it can get,
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.480]   but you of course are paying for it.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   But I see the replacement of our shades in the future
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.960]   for these automated ones.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.400]   It just feels like that's coming.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.000]   At the end of the day, 10 years from now,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.200]   you're gonna probably have the same shades
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.240]   and I might've swapped them out,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.200]   so you might've saved some money.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.040]   Perhaps.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.860]   This is great.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.200]   I've tried to avoid going down the home assistant,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.280]   home everything path of trying to hack together things
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.480]   on Raspberry Pis to make it all work.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.100]   And it's a little promising as an Apple family
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.280]   that maybe we could do it all with Apple Home
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.160]   and maybe we just need to run something
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.600]   to tie a few things together,
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.020]   but maybe we'll get there soon.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.060]   One random question, which I saved
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.640]   because I just thought you would have an opinion.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.840]   Do you use AA, AAA rechargeable batteries at home
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.420]   or have you given up on rechargeable batteries?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.800]   Because I feel like we bought all these Eneloop batteries
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.000]   at one point, they just don't hold a charge.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.960]   And am I missing something?
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.000]   You're not missing something.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.640]   We switched 100% to rechargeable batteries
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.480]   and there are some devices we use
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.620]   where it feels like we have to change them every month.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.080]   And it's like bananas,
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.880]   but it's because lithium ion batteries
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.080]   don't hold a voltage the same way as like an alkaline battery
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   or a non-rechargeable lithium ion battery.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.280]   So it's a voltage issue.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.560]   If you buy batteries you have to dispose of,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.800]   they'll last you six months or a year
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.080]   where the rechargeable ones only go every 30 days.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.520]   It's incredibly frustrating,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.460]   but I use them wherever I can.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.600]   And I try to avoid having to buy
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.680]   disposable batteries whenever I can.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.880]   I've gone back to it because it's unavoidable.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.040]   I would love to avoid that,
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.520]   but door locks are one where when we use
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.160]   rechargeable batteries on door locks,
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.520]   it just feels like it's a security risk
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.120]   because you leave down for a week
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.080]   and your batteries might die while you're gone.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.300]   Yep, exactly.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.280]   You buy the disposable one, it'll be good for a year,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.640]   but you put the Eneloops in
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.020]   and they're dead in six weeks, frustrating.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.140]   Any other random thoughts?
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.100]   We've covered a lot,
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.040]   but before we wrap on things that you thought about
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.400]   when you built this new home
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.640]   that you wish you had maybe known about
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.080]   or thought about earlier
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.000]   or would recommend other people consider
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.820]   if they're retrofitting or building a home.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.240]   This may be a cop out of an answer,
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.080]   but I would say,
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.280]   I actually just did a video on this recently.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.600]   Keep it simple, stupid, the KISS rule.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.720]   Don't overcomplicate it.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.160]   Keep it simple because as we talked about in the beginning,
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.280]   one of the first things you should do
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.800]   is look into energy systems, energy advisors in your area.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.200]   The simplest thing you could do might be
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.960]   just put some extra insulation in the attic
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.640]   and that will save you an incredible amount of money.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.120]   You don't have to jump through all the hoops,
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.280]   get all the crazy new smart home gear,
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.240]   get out home assistant,
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.280]   do crazy smart home stuff to save money on your home.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.240]   Just keep it simple.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.920]   - Every time I put together a system
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.880]   that relied on some Android tablet or some Raspberry Pi,
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.360]   I've never ended up keeping using it.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.760]   So I support that advice and this has been great.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.580]   I have a few things.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.040]   I need to go find one of these advisors.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.080]   So that's my next step
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.160]   and see how airtight our home is,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.120]   is the first step, what the big options are.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   Because we actually considered, do we need another battery?
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.800]   And now I'm wondering, maybe we don't.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.740]   - Yeah, you might not.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.940]   - I've watched a ton of these videos.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.880]   Where should people find your home base
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.420]   to see everything you're working on
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.680]   and to go deeper on any of the things we talked about?
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.400]   If you go to undecidedmf.com, that's my website.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.520]   It's got my YouTube videos on there, articles we're writing.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.400]   It's got everything.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.040]   Central location would be there, including the podcasts.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:51.880]   Awesome.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.000]   I've gone down a lot of rabbit holes.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.920]   Keep the KISS method in mind
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.520]   as you're going down the rabbit hole of Matt's videos.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.960]   Focus on the big areas
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.320]   and I think you could probably find a lot of savings
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.300]   and I know you've got a lot of home automation
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.720]   and smart home videos coming soon on this new house
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.200]   and I'm very excited to check them out.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.520]   - Awesome, thanks for being here.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.360]   - Thanks again.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.000]   - Wow, I hope you enjoyed that episode as much as I did.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.200]   I'm recording this outro a few days later
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.160]   because I went down a few deep rabbit holes.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.280]   Most importantly, I set up Homebridge,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.500]   which Matt and I spoke about briefly
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.200]   and I now have basically every device in our home
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.080]   all linked up and going through to Apple Home.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.660]   Anything basically that wasn't supported by Apple Home
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.020]   can be routed in there.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.480]   I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.800]   Definitely worth checking out
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.640]   if you wanna get on Apple Home.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.880]   Really, really happy with how it all ended up
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.000]   and I also ended up buying a Apple TV over the weekend
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.040]   so that I could set up a Home Hub
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.280]   so that I could use everything in Apple Home
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.200]   when we're not actually in the house.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.640]   If you have any questions, thoughts, feedback,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.920]   definitely let me know.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.460]   I always love hearing it
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.640]   and if you're based in LA
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.160]   and you wanna join me at the NAS Summit,
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.280]   like I mentioned earlier in the episode,
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.700]   I do have a few free tickets.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.700]   Just go to allthehacks.com/NAS for NAS, N-A-S,
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.200]   and fill a few things out
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.580]   and I'll see if I can get you on the list for a free ticket.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.620]   That's it for this week.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.340]   You can always reach me, podcast@allthehacks.com.

[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.420]   (electronic music fades)
