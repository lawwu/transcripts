[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.800]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.820]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.360]   Today marks the fifth episode
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.800]   in our six-episode series all about sleep
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.240]   with expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.080]   Today's episode focuses on the inextricable link
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.280]   between sleep and our mental health.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.480]   For instance, a specific stage of sleep
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.760]   called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   is critical for removing the emotional content
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360]   of our previous day's memories,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.500]   and in doing so, provides a sort of therapy within sleep
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000]   that allows us to feel emotionally restored
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.640]   when we wake the next morning.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.440]   We discuss what happens when you are deprived of REM sleep
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.560]   to a small or greater degree,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.400]   and we discuss how to improve the quality
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.160]   and quantity of your REM sleep
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   in order to ensure mental health.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.120]   We also discuss science-based protocols
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.720]   for reducing rumination and negative thoughts before sleep.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   The information shared by Dr. Walker in today's episode
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.040]   is sure to be critical for anyone
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.160]   that is either struggling with mental health issues
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.440]   or who simply wants to bolster their overall mental health.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.760]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.840]   to bring zero-cost to consumer information
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.200]   to the general public.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.280]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.880]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.340]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.560]   Many times on this podcast,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.520]   we discuss how in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.680]   your body temperature actually needs to drop
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.440]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.800]   And in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   and energized, your body temperature needs to heat up
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.280]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.560]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   of your sleeping environment
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.620]   so that it's easy to fall and stay asleep
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.300]   and wake up feeling refreshed.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.320]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.300]   several years ago,
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.580]   and it has completely and positively transformed my sleep.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.360]   So much so that when I travel to hotels or Airbnbs,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.620]   I really miss my Eight Sleep.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.700]   I've even shipped my Eight Sleep out to hotels
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.540]   that I've been staying in
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.480]   because it improves my sleep that much.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.740]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.760]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.640]   to save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.680]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.100]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.120]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.800]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.220]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.320]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.840]   That means plenty of the electrolytes,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.780]   magnesium, potassium, and sodium, and no sugar.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780]   As I mentioned before on this podcast,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.120]   I'm a big fan of salt.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.960]   Now, I wanna be clear,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.240]   people who already consume a lot of salt
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.200]   or who have high blood pressure
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.520]   or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.080]   that typically contain salt
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.680]   need to control their salt intake.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   However, if you're somebody who eats pretty clean
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.960]   and you're somebody who exercises
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.520]   and you're drinking a lot of water,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.420]   there's a decent chance that you could benefit
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.040]   from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280]   The reason for that is that all the cells in our body,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   including the nerve cells, the neurons,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.920]   require the electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.300]   So we don't just wanna be hydrated,
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.200]   we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.160]   With Element, that's very easy to do.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.640]   What I do is when I wake up in the morning,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.880]   and I'll dissolve a packet of Element in that water.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.920]   I'll also do the same when I exercise,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.320]   especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.600]   And sometimes I'll even have a third Element packet
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.260]   dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.240]   or sweating a lot, or if I just noticed
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.400]   that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.620]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.040]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled lmnt.com/huberman
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.240]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.200]   Again, that's drinkelement, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.960]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.200]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.300]   I've been doing therapy for over 30 years.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.640]   Initially, it was a requirement
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.160]   for being let back in school,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   but I decided to keep up with that therapy
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.840]   because provided the therapy has three essential components,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.120]   which are excellent rapport with the therapist,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   support from the therapist,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.900]   and valuable insights from the therapist
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.600]   that we wouldn't otherwise be able to arrive at,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.160]   well, then it's a terrific way
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   to improve our mental landscape,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.080]   both our emotional state and our behaviors.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.720]   BetterHelp allows you to find a therapist
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.740]   with whom you have those three key components,
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.000]   and it also makes it very easy to schedule.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.760]   Again, the sessions are carried out entirely online,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.200]   and even if you're extremely busy or traveling a lot
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.560]   or have a lot of family and business obligations,
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.400]   BetterHelp allows you
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.560]   to access those therapy sessions regularly
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.280]   so that you can constantly improve.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.140]   There's just oh so much data supporting
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.620]   that quality therapy can improve our mental health
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.800]   and the overall landscape of our lives.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.280]   In fact, I view quality therapy
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.440]   as important as physical exercise,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.000]   and I know many others do as well.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120]   There certainly aren't a replacement for one another,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.600]   but if you're doing physical exercise,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.120]   meaning resistance training and cardiovascular training,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.040]   and you're doing regular quality therapy
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.000]   of the sort that BetterHelp can provide,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.200]   well, then you're essentially doing
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.120]   as much as anyone possibly can
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   to improve your mental health and physical health.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.500]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.300]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.820]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.120]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.600]   Dr. Matthew Walker, welcome back.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.520]   - Dr. Andrew Huberman, delight to be back.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   - During the course of this series,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   we've of course been talking about sleep,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.860]   and you've talked about the biology of sleep,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.320]   ways to improve, maybe even optimize one's sleep.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.060]   You defined what optimizing one's sleep actually is.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.620]   Talked about learning and memory, creativity,
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.840]   caffeine, naps, food, exercise, and so much more.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.160]   Today, I'm excited that you're going to teach us
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   about the relationship between sleep and emotion regulation,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.200]   but also mental health, mental health challenges.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.520]   But I sometimes like to remind people
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.600]   that mental health includes the word health.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's not all about mental illness.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.440]   It's also about how to improve one's health,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.840]   as well as ways to combat certain forms
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.400]   of mental illness or challenges.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.560]   So to start things off,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.040]   maybe you could just give us the basics
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.440]   of the relationship between sleep and emotional states,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.900]   or one's ability to regulate their own emotions.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.440]   - This is an area of work that we've been interested in
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   and doing a lot of research on for about 20 or so years now.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.280]   And I would say that probably the most striking statement
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.600]   I can offer up front is the following.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.300]   In that 20 years of research,
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.320]   we have not been able to discover
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.460]   a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.520]   And to me, it has taught me everything that I need to know
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.640]   about this very intimate bi-directional relationship
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.920]   between your sleep health and your mental health.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   And you're right to emphasize that notion of mental health,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   because we're not just going to speak
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.980]   about some of the sort of challenging aspects
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.280]   of sleep and psychiatric disorders,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.300]   but we'll speak about some of the benefits
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.080]   that sleep can provide when you get it to turn the tables.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.680]   And we move in the direction, not of mental illness,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.600]   but we move in the direction of mental wellness.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.420]   So I'm excited to sort of make sure
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.640]   that I don't fall prey to that.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.980]   Stepping back still though,
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.400]   what about this relationship between just sleep
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.160]   and our basic emotional regulation
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.500]   and our emotional stability?
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.880]   I'm sure everyone has seen the example
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.200]   or had the example as a parent,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.040]   of that parent holding a child and the child is crying
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.680]   and they look at you and they say,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.340]   "Well, they just didn't sleep well last night."
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.320]   As if there's some miraculous parental knowledge
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.060]   that bad sleep the night before equals bad mood
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.960]   and emotional reactivity and regulation the next day.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.060]   And some years ago now, we were fascinated by this,
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.340]   but we couldn't really unearth basic science
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.100]   that would help us explain what was going on
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.540]   and why that was so clearly the case.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.900]   So we did an initial study
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.100]   where we took a group of healthy people,
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.300]   no signs of psychiatric illness or emotional instability,
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.320]   and we gave them a full night of sleep
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.060]   or we sleep deprived them.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.820]   And then the next day we put them inside of a brain scanner
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.860]   and we showed them a whole range
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.420]   of emotional visual images ranging from very neutral
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.420]   all the way up to quite unpleasant and negative.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.300]   And we were looking at how the brain was reacting
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.700]   to those emotional experiences with versus without sleep.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.260]   And the structure that we'd initially focused on
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260]   was a structure that you've spoken about before
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.740]   called the amygdala.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.100]   And you actually have one on the left
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.980]   and the right side of your brain.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.500]   And the amygdala is the centerpiece region
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   for the generation of emotional reactions,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.100]   both positive and negative.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.460]   But here we're focusing on that aversive,
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.340]   that negative aspect.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.460]   And when we looked at that structure
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.580]   in people who are sleep deprived,
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.340]   what we saw relative to the people
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.980]   who'd had a full night of sleep was a 60% sick zero,
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.980]   60% increase in amygdala responsivity
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.540]   under conditions of sleep deprivation.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.940]   That is quite a striking amplification.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.860]   In fact, we to that date with all of our studies
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.820]   on sleep and sleep loss had not quite seen an effect size
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.580]   within the brain that was that big.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.100]   - Sorry to interrupt, but just to make sure
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.180]   that everyone's on the same page.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.900]   So people are being shown images
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.740]   with varying degrees of emotionality,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.740]   including images that are known to evoke negative,
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.060]   averse emotions as we call them in the laboratory.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.740]   - That's correct.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.520]   - Could be feelings of fear, anger, disgust,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   revulsion, whatever, negative valence.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.240]   Was it the case that sleep deprivation increased
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.840]   the activity in the amygdala to such images by 60%
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.000]   only for the aversive images or for,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   let's say a neutral image presented to somebody
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.580]   who has had plenty of quality sleep.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.040]   Let's say it is, I'm making up the units here.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   It gives us two out of 10 units of amygdala activation.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.720]   This isn't the way neuroscience is done,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.680]   but for sake of discussion.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.120]   Is it the case then that that neutral image
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.880]   would provide a six out of 10 level of activation
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.560]   or was it only for aversive images?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.320]   - So the way we did the analysis first
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   was we used almost a correlation approach.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.320]   So we sort of told the brain imaging analysis to say,
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.680]   look, here are the ratings of these pictures.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.080]   And they go from very neutral
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.560]   to increasingly negative and aversive.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   And show me what in the brain is reacting to that curve,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   that gradient curve.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.880]   And sure enough, you've got the magnitude overall was 60%,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.280]   but it's a very interesting point that you make
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.880]   because where the amygdala started to respond
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   and that responsivity started to hook up
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.080]   in the activation and the sort of aggravation direction
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.880]   was much earlier in the curve of emotionality.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.040]   In other words, things that previously
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.080]   when you've had a good night of sleep
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.640]   do not feel particularly emotional
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.360]   started to become rather emotional
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   when you were not getting sufficient sleep.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.080]   So it heightened the sensitivity
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.160]   of the initial triggering of the emotional response.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.480]   And then the more emotional it became,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   the more separate those two sort of reactivity curves became
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.760]   from the amygdala when you had sleep
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.280]   versus when you had not sleep or had not slept, I should say.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.880]   To us then the question became, well, why?
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Why is the amygdala so reactive and uncontrolled
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.200]   when you are absent sleep?
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.040]   And we did another analysis.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.440]   And what we found was that there was a structure
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.240]   in your frontal lobe and the frontal lobe
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.400]   just sits directly sort of if you think about your eyes
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.240]   and you go directly up, you're in your frontal lobe.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.400]   And it was a particular part of the frontal lobe,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.360]   the middle part that sits right between your eyes
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.160]   something that we call the medial prefrontal cortex.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.680]   And what we found was that with a night of sleep
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.080]   the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.800]   was strongly connected to the amygdala.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.480]   Why is that important?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.840]   It's because that part of your frontal lobe
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   is very good at acting like a control rational mechanism
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.400]   on your deep sort of, it's not Neanderthal
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.920]   but your deep emotional brain centers.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.040]   But without sleep,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.560]   we found that that connection had been severed.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.480]   And so it was almost as though without sleep
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.200]   you become all emotional gas pedal
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.920]   and too little regulatory control break.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.080]   And so you couldn't modulate those emotions
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.760]   anywhere near as effectively.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.880]   Now, some people may say, well, hang on a second,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.200]   you that was a total night of sleep deprivation.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.960]   And that's not really relevant for me
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.040]   because I don't sleep enough.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.400]   I know that from all of the previous episodes
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.080]   that I've gone through here,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.440]   hopefully if you've listened to them,
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.160]   but I'm usually maybe getting five or six hours of sleep.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.280]   Is this really relevant?
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.920]   So we started doing that study.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.160]   We wanted to say, let's do what we call an ecological study
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.480]   and more of a real world sleep restriction
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.160]   rather than total deprivation.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.320]   And we were about halfway through that study
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.040]   when a wonderful Japanese research group
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.120]   essentially published the study that we were doing.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.480]   And what was great is that they did it
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   even in a more rigorous way.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.400]   And essentially what they were able to do
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.520]   is replicate exactly what we'd found,
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.480]   but now by putting people on sort of less than six hours
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.640]   of sleep for five nights,
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.400]   and sure enough, you got the same response.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.680]   So that was very clear to us
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.440]   that there was some sensitivity.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   There's a reason why you become so unbuckled emotionally
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.040]   when you are not getting sufficient sleep.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.520]   It's the reason that you have almost this
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.280]   sort of erratic pendulum-like sort of responsivity
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.680]   when you're not getting sufficient sleep,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.920]   that notion of I just snap, dot, dot, dot,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.640]   or you apologize and you say, look, I am so sorry.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.240]   I just bit your head off.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.600]   I just haven't been getting enough sleep.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.200]   And so we could start to understand
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.400]   what in the brain was happening
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.800]   when you didn't get sleep.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.960]   - It's such an important finding
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.740]   for a couple of reasons that maybe we can explore.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.240]   Previously on the podcast,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   we had a guest doctor.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   He's a neurosurgeon, Matt McDougall.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.080]   He's the lead neurosurgeon at Neuralink.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   He came up through Stanford,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.560]   works on deep brain stimulation, et cetera.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.680]   And I love his description
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.880]   of what the prefrontal cortex does.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.640]   It jibes perfectly with the way you describe it,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.480]   which is, he said,
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.560]   "The function of the prefrontal cortex
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.720]   is to say shh
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.360]   to specific brain areas under specific contexts."
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.200]   So the shh, of course,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   is his way of describing neural inhibition,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.340]   so quieting of neural activity
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.480]   in certain brain circuits under certain conditions,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.300]   because there are conditions
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.080]   under which you want your amygdala activation
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.640]   to be very robust, fast,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.280]   and there's time for protecting oneself,
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.640]   maybe even certain situations for swift, violent action
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   to protect your family, et cetera.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.200]   But the prefrontal cortex
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.280]   seems to be able to hold it in mind, so to speak,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.520]   what the context is
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.280]   under which that would be appropriate
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.520]   versus when it would be inappropriate.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.360]   - And a great example of that people can think of,
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.680]   if all of a sudden a gun is pointed in your face,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.200]   you would want your amygdala to react
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.300]   if it's in the real world.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.240]   But if you're at the movie theaters
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.680]   and you see a gun pointed in your face,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.080]   your amygdala doesn't really react as much.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.920]   Why?
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.880]   Because your prefrontal cortex
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   understood the word that you described, which is context.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.600]   But in some ways,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.720]   it seems as though you become almost regressed
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.440]   to this more basic, fundamental,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.040]   elemental, emotional brain,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.200]   and the red mist descends
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.960]   and you really can't see much more
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.320]   because your prefrontal cortex seems to be absent.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.040]   - You become very reflex-driven.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.400]   And we don't wanna go too far a tangent
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.960]   of on prefrontal cortex,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.520]   but one of the most beautiful descriptions
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.680]   of prefrontal cortex I ever heard
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.280]   was also from a colleague, Eric Knudsen at Stanford,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.320]   who's now retired,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.620]   does beautiful work on neuroplasticity.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.120]   And he described how when people or animals
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   have lesions to certain regions of the prefrontal cortex,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.280]   they become stimulus-driven machines
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.480]   such that if you go like this to a puppy or to a baby,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.760]   they'll look to the snapping finger.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.120]   But at some point, we all learn
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.000]   that there must be a reason for us to follow
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.360]   the snapping of the fingers in different locations in space.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.480]   But with prefrontal damage,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.460]   people and animals just become like machines.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.640]   Whatever stimulus is there, they orient to.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.040]   And this has implications for ADHD, et cetera.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.240]   One of the things that I wanted to ask about
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.360]   to take us back to the specific relationship
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.800]   between sleep, reduced medial prefrontal activity,
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.240]   and emotionality is this feeling
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.300]   when we're sleep-deprived
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.040]   that certain things just grate on us a bit more.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.360]   You know, I had this experience recently.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.300]   Unfortunately, there was a night
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.080]   where I didn't get much sleep at all.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.480]   And then the next day I was on a phone call
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.920]   and the person I was talking to, I'm quite fond of,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.960]   but they had a lot of energy and they were talking.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   They were kind of coming at me
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.680]   with a bunch of stuff that they wanted to.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.520]   And it just felt like, you know,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.120]   it was grating on my system.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.280]   And I knew because I was sleep-deprived that, you know,
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.840]   they were entirely well-meaning.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.560]   And so you just kind of resist.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   But it's incredible how cold water, loud noises,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.720]   requests of our time, things like that
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.440]   become very irritating and they grate on us
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   when we're sleep-deprived.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.920]   Whereas when we're rested, it's like, oh yeah, okay.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.840]   They're talking kind of fast or kind of loud.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.400]   Okay, somebody is requesting something else.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.660]   I'll put it in my list or maybe I'll defer to later.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.920]   Or, you know, the cold shower that, you know,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.300]   feels like, oh, got to get over this threshold to get into.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.600]   Like when you're rested, you're like, all right,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.800]   let's do this, right?
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.600]   You know, maybe even let's go.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.800]   I'm excited for it.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.960]   But when you're tired, ooh,
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.180]   it is as if the brain is fighting
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.880]   for any sense of peace it can possibly get.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.580]   And that peace is interrupted
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.840]   by almost anything and everything.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.440]   - It is a grim situation.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   And we've certainly heard that from, you know,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.580]   patients and individuals.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.580]   It's almost as though the world that they are experiencing,
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.760]   they look at and they say, you know what?
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   You're in an 11 and I need you at a seven right now.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.960]   It is just too much.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.320]   And this comes back to that result that we described
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.960]   that when the amygdala crosses the threshold and says,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.840]   okay, things are getting emotional,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.480]   things are getting unpleasant.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.360]   I'm gonna be responding negatively in an angry way
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.800]   or a fearful way.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.780]   That starts much earlier.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.260]   So the threshold for triggering
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.260]   your emotional aversive reaction is much lower.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.540]   And that's why the person's voice, when you hear it,
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.720]   first, normally, if you had a great night of sleep,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.020]   you'd say, gosh, you know what?
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.900]   Today, I really love your energy.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.020]   It's really, it's so infectious.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.940]   Versus a day when you're not sleeping,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.060]   you just think, I just,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.620]   I'm lifting my earbuds out of my ears
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.200]   'cause I don't know if I can take this much longer.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.160]   And so that was where we were able to manipulate sleep
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.440]   one way, which is to say, I dial sleep down.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.120]   And then I look at the emotional brain
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.160]   and you can see this ramping up of the emotional reactivity
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   in these basic kind of guttural centers.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.560]   But then we wanted to do the inverse.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.440]   We wanted to instead see if we could insert sleep back in,
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.440]   in other words, manipulate sleep and dial it back up.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.040]   Could you get a dissipation in the emotional reaction?
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.560]   And here we decided to throw a second ingredient
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.800]   into the equation,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.200]   not just simply looking at your emotional reactivity,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.760]   but we wanted to look at emotional memory.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.560]   Now, in a previous episode,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.040]   we've spoken a lot about sleep and memory,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.360]   but there we were speaking about
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.520]   really quite neutral memory,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.120]   textbook-like memory, fact-based memory.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.520]   Emotional memory is very different.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.640]   And if I were to ask you, Andrew,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.000]   cast your mind back to some of your earliest
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.100]   childhood memories or your team memories,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.580]   and if anyone listening were to do that,
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.960]   my guess is that almost all of the memories that you recall
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   are memories of an emotional nature, positive or negative.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.920]   Why is that?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.920]   It's because one of the functions of emotions
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.160]   when it comes to memory is to red flag
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   and prioritize that experience,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.800]   that memory as being salient because it's emotional.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   And that instructs the brain that this information
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.480]   in particular is very relevant to us as an organism.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.440]   Why?
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.240]   Because the rest of the brain is shouting at me,
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.760]   this is emotional.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.880]   So there is something very privileged
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.900]   and very special about an emotional memory,
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.480]   like a red flag that tags it for priority in the brain.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.600]   But something I started to notice when I would read
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.720]   the data, both the neural data and the subjective data
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.880]   on emotional memory, led me to get very interested
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.920]   in what happens with emotional memories over time.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.520]   Because what you will hear is that if I were to ask you,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.640]   you know, recall an emotional memory,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   just try to remember it.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.440]   My guess is that now at the time of recollection,
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.440]   much later on, you are not having the same regurgitation
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.600]   of the same visceral emotional reaction
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.520]   that you had at the time of the experience.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.240]   What that sort of turned a light bulb moment on for me
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.160]   was that somewhere between the initial experience
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   and the later recollection of that emotional memory,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.600]   the brain has done a very clever trick.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.040]   It has divorced the emotion from the memory.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.320]   So now when you come to recollect that emotional memory,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.640]   let's say days later, or even months later,
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.200]   in some ways it is a memory of an emotional event,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.560]   but it is no longer as powerfully emotional itself
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.800]   as it was at the time of the experience.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.120]   - Right.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.440]   - And I started to wonder, is that time,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.600]   or is that time asleep?
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.680]   So we did a study and we had people experience
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.600]   these emotional memories,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.120]   sort of essentially make emotional memories,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.600]   and they were doing it inside of a scanner.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   And then we gave them a night of sleep or even a nap,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.080]   and then we brought them back,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   or we just had them learn those emotional memories
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   in the morning and then bring them back
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.280]   after an identical amount of time
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.240]   to try to soften those emotional memories,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.680]   but without sleep.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.720]   And we put them back in the scanner,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.480]   and we were able to look to see when you come back later
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.400]   in that second session, is your emotional,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.280]   and you recollect those experiences and you relive them,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.720]   is the emotional reactivity at that second session
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.200]   any different to the first session?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.000]   And is that different if that time elapse
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.760]   has contained a full night of sleep
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.920]   versus you've just been awake?
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.400]   And what we found is that in those people
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.320]   who remained awake across the day,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.640]   having had those emotional memories,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.320]   essentially implanted, implanted sounds a little bit
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.000]   sort of big brother, I don't mean it that way,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.800]   but they'd learned them.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.520]   The amygdala was just still as responsive
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.440]   as they were recalling and reliving
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.960]   and re-experiencing those emotional memories.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.720]   But in those people who had the same amount of time
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.320]   to process the memories,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   but had had a full night of sleep,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   we saw this incredible emotional amygdala depotentiation
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.160]   and what that taught me was that the sleeping brain
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.840]   was able to almost detox the emotional memory.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   It is, think about it like an informational orange,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   that the emotional memory has this bitter emotional rind
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.680]   around it and then you've got the informational orange
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.640]   in the middle.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.040]   And what sleep was doing was stripping
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.440]   the bitter emotional rind off the informational orange
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.200]   so that then when you came back the next day,
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.960]   again, it is now a memory of an emotional event,
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.480]   but it's no longer triggering that strong visceral reaction.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.840]   In other words, and we described this theory
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.360]   as something called overnight forgetting,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.600]   which is that when it comes to an emotional memory,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.200]   you both sleep to forget
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.760]   and sleep to remember respectively,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.920]   which is that you sleep to remember the information,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.800]   the memory of the experience,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.160]   but it is no longer emotional itself.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.520]   And from there, we built a biological model
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.360]   of exactly how this works.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   Because when we looked at the sleep group
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.200]   who'd had that full eight hour opportunity,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.160]   we asked the question because we'd measured their sleep,
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.800]   what is it about that sleep
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   that seems to provide this form of,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.480]   it's almost overnight therapy.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.560]   How is it doing that?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.040]   What stage of sleep is doing that?
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.480]   And sure enough, what we found was that it was REM sleep,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.800]   rapid eye movement sleep associated with dreaming.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.400]   And the greater the amount of REM sleep,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.880]   the greater the amount of emotional depotentiation,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   the greater the amount of sort of emotional detox
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.600]   that you got the next day.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.840]   And one of the fascinating things
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.200]   that we didn't quite mention in the episode
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.320]   where we described what is sleep
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.760]   and we described the different stages,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.360]   including REM and we spoke about the brain changes.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   Something utterly unique happens during REM sleep.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.480]   Levels of a brain chemical called noradrenaline
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.240]   are completely shut off.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.160]   It is the only time during the 24 hour period
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.280]   when you see the complete cessation
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.760]   of noradrenaline in the brain.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.880]   And of course, noradrenaline is associated
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.440]   with many different functions
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.680]   and you've elegantly described them.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.160]   One of the functions is that it's associated
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.800]   with emotional responsivity and the focus
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.320]   and that sort of strong sort of emotional energy.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.080]   And people will know we speak about,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   it has two names, noradrenaline or norepinephrine,
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.640]   same thing, US, UK.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.160]   But people of course are familiar
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.640]   with the sister chemical in the body called adrenaline.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.840]   Upstairs in the brain, we can think about noradrenaline
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.160]   and during REM sleep, noradrenaline is completely shut off.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   This stress associated neurochemical,
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.920]   it's not only associated with stress,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.840]   but it's associated with lots of things,
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.000]   but stress included.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.840]   - Is noradrenaline shut off in the brain and body
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.280]   during rapid eye movement sleep?
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.440]   - No, it's not.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.160]   It seems to be specifically within the brain
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.560]   that there is this blockade of noradrenaline
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.600]   and serotonin goes down too.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.200]   Whereas another chemical called acetylcholine,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.080]   which is another neurotransmitter,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   that ramps up in the brain.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.880]   So if there is a brain chemical
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   that seems to be underlying REM sleep or dream sleep,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.240]   it seems to be acetylcholine.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.480]   And in fact, in some parts of the brain,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   you can see almost a 30% greater amount of acetylcholine
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   in some brain regions than when we're awake.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.280]   Yet, on the other hand,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.480]   when we think about noradrenaline and serotonin,
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.440]   they are both shut off.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.720]   So the stress related chemical within the brain
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.280]   is switched off during REM sleep.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.960]   However, if you look at other parts of the brain,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.320]   the memory related centers of the brain,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.840]   such as the hippocampus that we've spoken about before,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.520]   and the amygdala that I just mentioned too,
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.480]   those are very active during REM sleep.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.840]   So we laid out this biological model
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.600]   that is almost beautiful.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.680]   That REM sleep is this perfect condition
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.200]   for emotional overnight therapy,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.600]   where you can reactivate and sort of experience
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.760]   and reprocess those emotional memories,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.960]   but you're doing it in a neurochemically,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.840]   quote unquote, safe environment
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   that allows you to strip away the emotion from the memory.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.120]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.480]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.000]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.640]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.080]   and is designed to meet
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.280]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.400]   By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.640]   that I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.440]   and indeed that is true.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.720]   Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.560]   I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.440]   or minimally processed sources.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.960]   However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.640]   of fruits and vegetables each day.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.000]   So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.360]   of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber,
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.720]   and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.080]   and of course, I still make sure
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.440]   to eat fruits and vegetables,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.600]   and in that way provide a sort of insurance
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.240]   that I'm getting enough of what I need.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.720]   In addition, the adaptogens and other micronutrients in AG1
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.240]   really help buffer against stress
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.160]   and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.800]   are getting the things they need.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.520]   People often ask me that if they were gonna take
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.800]   just one supplement, what that supplement should be,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.920]   and I always answer AG1.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.480]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.440]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.840]   to claim a special offer.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.520]   You'll get five free travel packs
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.080]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.760]   In some ways, it does resemble
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.360]   behavioral desensitization therapy,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.280]   whereby under the care of a qualified psychiatrist
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.320]   or psychologist, somebody will be encouraged to recall
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.040]   in a great degree of detail some very difficult,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   maybe even traumatic event, and through repetition,
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.720]   and of course, through the knowledge
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.800]   that there's support in the immediate environment
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.520]   that will allow them to, you know,
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.440]   safely move through that experience.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.260]   You know, should their heart rate go up,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.540]   they're sweating profusely,
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.920]   having trouble getting the words out.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.640]   You know, those are very, unfortunately,
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.240]   common features of trauma and negative memories.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.000]   But the idea, as I understand,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   is to repeat the recall many times often
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.480]   in that safe environment,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.160]   such that eventually what was initially
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   a really terrible event remains a terrible event,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.660]   but the emotional load of that event
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.760]   is removed from the person's sort of neural understanding
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.720]   of the event.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.360]   The way I've heard it described is
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.440]   what starts as a tragic, traumatic story
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.440]   eventually becomes a kind of a sad, boring story,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.840]   boring to the person who's saying it,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.360]   meaning it doesn't evoke as much autonomic arousal.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.680]   - Exactly, and in some ways,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.440]   that's the perfect description
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.560]   of this overnight therapy process,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.360]   that it becomes a memory that is no longer triggering
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.240]   an emotional reaction.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.480]   And in some ways, that's what you want.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.360]   If you go back to my description
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.720]   from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.200]   I told you that one of the functions of emotions
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.540]   is to red flag and prioritize the memory
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.240]   at the time of learning to say that it's important.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.200]   That's a very adaptive process.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.400]   It helps us prioritize which things
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.240]   we really should be focusing on and remembering,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.720]   but it's not adaptive for you to hold on
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.480]   to that emotion long-term once you've stored it.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.520]   And there has been some suggestion in the literature
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.080]   before we were doing this work
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.400]   that maybe one thing you can do with trauma
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   and trauma memories is sleep-deprived individuals
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.360]   the very first night after the trauma,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.680]   because we knew at the time, sleep is important for memory.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.440]   And what you would like to do,
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.280]   and it's very similar to that movie,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.800]   "Sunshine Spotless Mind."
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.920]   I always forget the--
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.760]   - "Eternalist."
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.240]   - "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.080]   Thank you.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.560]   - I didn't see the movie, but I hear it's good.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.080]   - Yeah, and what they try to do is target in the brain
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.280]   these difficult, painful experiences
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.360]   and just excise them from the brain.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.960]   And that was the suggestion.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.600]   Could you pop those memories out of the biography
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.480]   of that individual and save them the trauma?
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.800]   I would argue that's not really what you want to do,
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.960]   because let's say that I have a trauma experience
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   where I was walking home at night
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.360]   from the sleep laboratory late at night,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.640]   and I was coming down kind of an alley to take a shortcut,
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.080]   and someone sticks me up with a gun, maybe some violence.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.440]   I don't want to remove that memory.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.880]   I would like to remove the trauma response
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.560]   associated with that memory.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.960]   But I would argue for me as an organism,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.400]   it's still very important for me to remember
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.720]   that that alley was associated with a bad experience,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.840]   and I should forego going down that very same route again.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.920]   I want to hold onto the memory, the information.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.680]   I want to let go of the emotion.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   I want to sleep to remember, and I want to sleep to forget.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.120]   And I'll come on to why I think that's relevant to PTSD
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.040]   when we perhaps speak about that condition,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.600]   and it's very, very relevant.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.040]   But coming back to REM sleep,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.880]   we look back in the literature to see
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.040]   if we could find signs that REM sleep had this relationship
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.480]   with even just your basic emotional reactivity.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.800]   And there was some wonderful work by a gentleman
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.000]   that you will know from Stanford,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   probably one of the founding fathers
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.880]   of modern day sleep research,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.800]   a gentleman called William Dement.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.080]   - Yeah, who passed away a few years ago.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.240]   - He did.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.160]   - Might've been one of the people
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.320]   who coined the term rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.560]   but I don't think he was the one who discovered it, correct?
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.160]   - He was not, but he was well up there
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.920]   in terms of understanding both sort of what its term was
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.560]   and also what its function was.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.360]   He, legend as he was, very early on,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.400]   this was probably in the 60s,
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   he would take individuals,
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.240]   because we didn't really have the first published report
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.760]   of these two types of sleep, of REM and non-REM,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.120]   until they collected the data or found the data in 1953.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.960]   It was published in 1954.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.120]   So in other words, we discovered that even up to then,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.160]   prior to then, we just thought sleep was sleep.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.920]   We didn't have any knowledge that these different stages.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.640]   So in the same year that Francis Crick unveiled
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.520]   this incredible helical structure
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.000]   that was called a DNA strand,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.920]   we also discovered the different stages of sleep.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.280]   But in the 60s then, William Dement,
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.120]   knowing that there were these two types of sleep
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.400]   and knowing that there was something that was going on
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.680]   with REM sleep where people were dreaming
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.240]   and he would be waking people up from these different stages
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.600]   and found that it's far more likely
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.240]   for people to report a dream.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.360]   He wondered what the consequence would be
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.040]   if you selectively deprive people
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.360]   of this stage of sleep, of dream sleep.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.840]   So he brought individuals into his laboratory
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.520]   and every time they would go into REM sleep,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.640]   they would go into the room, they would wake them up,
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.800]   have them do some mathematical problems
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.120]   for two or three minutes and then put them back asleep
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.840]   and they go back into non-REM.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.000]   And then as soon as they went back into REM,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.320]   they would wake them up again.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.240]   And the first night they would have to go into the room
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.320]   maybe six or seven times.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.920]   - Still brutal for the person in the experiment.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.760]   - It's not too much fun.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.480]   But by the end of the five days or six days,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.000]   I think they were going back into the room
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.840]   something like 17, 18 times, why?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   Because the people were building up
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.280]   this growing REM sleep debt
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.800]   and the brain had such a hunger for it
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   that by night five of no REM sleep,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.120]   all it wanted to do was rocket
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.760]   into this thing called REM sleep
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.000]   and start devouring it with high volume.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.240]   But that wasn't the interesting part.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.800]   The interesting part was the consequence to these subjects.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.880]   They were all well-adjusted, perfectly normal individuals.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.160]   By about day three of selective REM sleep deprivation,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.920]   they started to show signs of paranoia.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.840]   They started to believe people were out after them.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.920]   They started to have hallucinations and delusions.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   And by day five, they were bordering on having
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.520]   aspects of quite severe psychosis.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.080]   And so what all of this research has taught us in some ways
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.480]   is that it's almost as though REM sleep,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.800]   and again, it's hyperbolic,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.720]   is the difference between sanity versus insanity.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.360]   It's the thing that separates those two.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.960]   And there's a wonderful quote
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   from an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.440]   And for all of the years of work
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.080]   that we've been doing in this field,
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.320]   and I've spilled so much ink over this,
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.600]   including in the book,
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.920]   he summarized it in a single sentence.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.040]   The best bridge between despair and hope
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.400]   is a good night of sleep.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.840]   And that's exactly what the data
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   is demonstrating in terms of basic emotional brain function.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.960]   - Such a powerful link there.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.640]   And I think it's appropriate therefore,
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.520]   if we explore a little bit about
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.280]   what the link actually consists of
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   in a way that will provide people a kind of a compass
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.160]   for when they're feeling a little bit
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.720]   less emotionally regulated,
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.800]   or if they would like to improve their levels
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.880]   of emotion regulation.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   This is going to be a little bit of an exploration,
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.000]   but you may recall,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.360]   this is an exploration that you and I had some years ago
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.800]   when we were talking about the relationship
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.860]   between rapid eye movement, sleep, and emotionality.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.800]   And here you've described
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.520]   that the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.640]   normally plays this kind of role,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.880]   this suppressive role over the amygdala under conditions
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.480]   where there is something to consider.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.320]   Is it averse?
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.140]   Is it not averse?
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:17.980]   How averse is it?
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.680]   But in terms of what we know about stress and emotion,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.000]   the autonomic nervous system,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.280]   this incredible system that balances sympathetic,
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.120]   meaning alertness arousal,
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.840]   sometimes called the fight or flight system,
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.640]   and parasympathetic activation,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.360]   sometimes called the rest and digest system.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   It's the balance of the two
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.400]   that dictates one's emotional state
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.340]   and alertness level of stress, et cetera.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.540]   And I've always imagined the autonomic nervous system,
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.440]   the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.320]   as sort of a seesaw.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.000]   But on this seesaw sits us, right?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.600]   And we can move back and forth across this seesaw,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.680]   but there's a component of the seesaw
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.080]   that in my mental model, which is the hinge,
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.240]   how tight the seesaw is,
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.780]   meaning how easily or how challenging it is
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.060]   to tilt the seesaw to one or the other side.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.100]   And I don't know if the mechanism has been discovered,
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.180]   but I feel like what happens under conditions
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.560]   of REM deprivation or sleep deprivation,
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.700]   that is sleep deprivation,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.260]   but you've beautifully described
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.860]   how it's REM deprivation in particular that can do this,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.240]   that the hinge becomes loose,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.860]   but the hinge doesn't become loose
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.940]   toward us becoming more parasympathetic and relaxed.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.140]   There's an asymmetry there.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.040]   It's as if the seesaw now wants to flop
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   to sympathetic activation until we're so exhausted
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.300]   that we just disappear into sleep.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.460]   So the question is this,
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.560]   and maybe all we have here is opportunity for speculation,
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   but is there any understanding of what the hinge might be
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.080]   and how sleep would adjust the tightness of that hinge?
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.960]   And if people are following this,
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.560]   what we're really trying to get to is,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.880]   you described a neural circuit mechanism within the brain,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.740]   but is this, for instance,
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.320]   the gating of the release of epinephrine,
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.780]   adrenaline, and cortisol?
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.480]   I mean, I could imagine that's regulated by the brain,
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.420]   but when we're deprived of REM sleep,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.860]   that process becomes less poorly gated,
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   and then we just will punch out a bunch of adrenaline
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.540]   in response to a phone call from a close friend
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.980]   that you adore, but is their voice is just a little bit loud
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.000]   and you're like, oh, this is rough, et cetera.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.280]   Do we understand the nature of the hinge?
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.300]   - We do a little bit,
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.940]   and it's something that we started off trying to test
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.120]   with one specific belief,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.880]   and then we were beautifully course-corrected by the data.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   We thought that the hinge was going to be,
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.880]   once you were sleep deprived and you started to slide down
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.440]   into that fight or flight branch,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.120]   the more sympathetic and away from the parasympathetic,
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.920]   that the hinge would get ever tighter,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.840]   the further into that sympathetic stress-related
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.520]   fight or flight dip that you had,
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.600]   and there you would stay.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.800]   It wasn't quite that simple.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.000]   What we found was that when I challenge you
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.980]   or put you either under a very simple
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.400]   cardiovascular challenge, let's say,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.840]   I'm just having you grip a bar for a long period of time,
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.080]   or we have you under some other,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.940]   maybe even if it's an exercise regimen,
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.400]   when you are in a sleep deprived state
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.460]   and you are largely inert
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.040]   and not interacting with the world,
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   you actually are in a more strong parasympathetic state.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.080]   It's almost as though you do not want to interact
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.800]   with the world per se, and this comes on to motivation.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.000]   We and others have found that one of the earliest
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   and strongest effects of a lack of sleep
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.560]   is just absence of motivation.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.600]   I don't want to interact with the world.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.320]   I don't want to be social.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.640]   I don't want to learn.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.360]   I don't want to exert effort.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.160]   I don't want to exercise.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.880]   I just don't want to do much of anything.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   However, when you provoke me and you force me to interact,
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.400]   or there is a very strong emotional event
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.840]   that I experience, I go all the way over
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.460]   into the strongly sympathetic.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.320]   So it's almost as though we had the prediction
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.280]   that it was going to be a very tight hinge
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.880]   and the screw was tightening
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.080]   the more sympathetic you became.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.960]   It was much more that you were
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.640]   in this sort of parasympathetic state,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.880]   this sort of non-motivational state.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.240]   And the hinge was so loose, however,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.600]   that even just the tiniest flick of a challenge,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.860]   whoosh, you went straight over to the sympathetic.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.520]   There was no sweet spot of a tightening
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:01.280]   where you were nicely balancing between those two states.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.840]   And this comes back to something else that we found.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.280]   That's you switching, flip-flopping back and forth
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.420]   between parasympathetic and sympathetic.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.360]   I spoke about the emotional reactivity
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.940]   to negative aversive events,
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.320]   but that's only one half of what we call
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.980]   the affective valence domain.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.680]   It's not just that you can have
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.220]   negative emotional reactions.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.020]   Of course, you can have positive emotional reactions.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.600]   So we did a sister study to that amygdala study.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.760]   And we asked, rather than showing you
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.360]   increasingly negative images
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.680]   and how your amygdala would respond
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.960]   much more strongly to those as we provoked it,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.320]   we then started to show you
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.280]   much more positive rewarding images.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.880]   And because one hypothesis would be that
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.000]   you just simply slide down the scale
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.480]   and you move towards more negative
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.540]   and away from more reward-based reactivity.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.200]   Or you could imagine that it's both,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.400]   that when you are sleep-deprived,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.520]   you are equally excessively reactive
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.520]   to both of those domains.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.440]   And what we found was that it was the latter,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.040]   that you were very abnormally reactive,
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.060]   overreactive to negative events,
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.000]   but you were equally hypersensitive
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.240]   to very reward-based stimuli.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.920]   And this fits beautifully with what we know
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.560]   from sleep deprivation.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.400]   You are much more impulsive,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   you are much more reward-seeking,
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.920]   you are much greater in terms of your sensation-seeking,
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.960]   and your addiction potential,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.900]   when you are not getting sufficient sleep,
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.240]   is significantly higher.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.360]   And sure enough, when we looked in the brain,
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.000]   many of these dopamine-related circuits
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.680]   that you've described before
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.280]   were overactive when you were under-slapped.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.760]   And so I bring this back
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.520]   because it relates to your seesaw sort of analogy.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.560]   Yes, you can think about the seesaw with sleep deprivation
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.600]   from a sympathetic/parasympathetic.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.040]   You can also think about it
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.240]   from a positive versus negative valence.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.400]   And once again, our hypothesis was
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.760]   that you're just gonna slide down into the negative
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.600]   and you're just gonna be less responsive
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.780]   to the rewarding positive.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.080]   It was the opposite.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.140]   You were abnormally and excessively sensitive
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.880]   to both of those domains,
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.600]   which you could argue is perhaps
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   the very worst of all adaptive responses as an organism.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.640]   You don't want to be non-reactive.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.880]   Emotions are powerful,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.260]   and we've spoken about the benefits.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.000]   You need to have emotions to be a functioning human being
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.680]   or organism in the world.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.400]   They are designed to adaptively help us survive,
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.420]   but you can't go to the extremes.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.400]   That's maladaptive rather than adaptive,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.480]   but that's where you go when you are sleep deprived.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.320]   It's this loose hinge and you become very, very erratically
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.000]   and extremely reactive from a neural perspective.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.640]   - Yeah, my understanding is that, you know,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.040]   sleep deprivation definitely increases impulsivity
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.200]   and addictive potential.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.740]   It's, yeah, so best, worst of both worlds in this case.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.140]   And given that, now would probably be an appropriate time
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.600]   to just cue people to some of the things
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.180]   that they can do to improve
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.060]   or maximize their rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:36.760]   This was covered in detail in episodes one and two,
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.500]   and to some extent in episodes three and four as well,
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.980]   but they're in reference to other things,
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.740]   learning memory, creativity, the role of naps, et cetera.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.740]   And I'll refer people back to this beautiful formula, QQRT,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.000]   that it's not just about getting enough sleep,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.400]   it's about the quantity indeed, but also the quality, QQ,
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:04.040]   regularity and timing of sleep and knowing one's chronotype,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.000]   that is the best time to go to bed
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.040]   and the best time to wake up in the morning for them
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.240]   is going to be critical here.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.720]   And I can raise my hand,
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   I'll raise both hands in fact, metaphorically,
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:20.060]   and say that when I've gone to sleep early
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.900]   and woken up early, so for me, 8.30, 9 p.m.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.820]   and then waking up at 4.30, 5 a.m.,
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.640]   which for me matches my chronotype,
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.020]   it has served as a powerful antidepressant effect.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.100]   And when I've gotten an equal amount of sleep,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.140]   but going to bed too late for me,
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.580]   that is, you know, midnight, 1 a.m.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.260]   and sleeping in until eight or 9 a.m.,
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.680]   I always carry a low level depression.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.600]   Fortunately, not something that needed to be medicated,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.480]   but it's a striking effect in the positive direction
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.320]   when obeying QQRT and in the negative direction when not.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.680]   So maybe just for, because we can provide some links
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.060]   to those segments in the show note captions,
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.160]   but maybe just for people that are here now,
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.720]   if we were going to list out, you know,
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.500]   two or three things that one can do to try and maximize
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.680]   the quality and quantity of REM sleep
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.300]   without going on too much of a tangent,
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.020]   but at the same time,
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.020]   we do want to highlight that addressing that QQRT formula
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.340]   for ourselves is going to be critical.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.820]   So maybe, so for REM sleep, you know,
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.340]   in the domain of exercise, temperature, et cetera,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.100]   are there any kind of quick bullet points
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.180]   that we can refer people to?
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:39.700]   - I would say just to keep it high level and brief,
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:46.000]   the single best way, cheapest non-pharmacological way
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.040]   that you can enhance your REM sleep
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.160]   is to just sleep an extra 15 or 20 minutes
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.720]   later into the morning.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.000]   Don't try to put, if I tell you, this is about,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.920]   by the way, this is about the quantity,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.280]   that your sleep opportunity.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.400]   Don't try to add that 30 minutes or 20 minutes
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   if your goal is to increase REM sleep
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.560]   at the start of the night, at the front end.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.580]   Instead, take that desire that I've offered you
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.240]   of adding just 20 minutes or 25 minutes of extra sleep.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.920]   Now, to the last part of your night,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.500]   wake up that sort of much later, 20, 25 minutes later.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.520]   That's the REM sleep rich phase.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.280]   So if people go back and listen to episode one,
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.920]   we'll describe to you exactly how the different stages
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.120]   of sleep unfold across the night.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.280]   And they're not evenly distributed.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.920]   It's not as though you get just as much REM sleep
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.880]   as well as deep non-REM sleep in the first half of the night
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.120]   as you do in the second.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.800]   You get most of your deep sleep in the first half
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.840]   and you get most of your REM sleep in the second half,
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.480]   and particularly in the last quarter of the night.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.040]   And this leads us to understand
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.280]   that the later into the morning hours that we go,
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.520]   the greater the hunger preference
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.240]   and the taste desire that is of your brain
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.560]   to start sampling from the finger buffet
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.320]   of all of those different stages,
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.800]   this thing called REM sleep.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.240]   And the later that you sleep into the morning,
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.120]   the more of that REM sleep that you will have.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.100]   And many people will have experienced this at the weekend
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.440]   where they have this pattern that we don't recommend
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.200]   based on the QQRT.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.440]   QQR, regularity, goes a bit at the same time,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.800]   wake up at the same time.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.400]   What we see often in society
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.880]   is something that we call social jet lag,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.840]   where you're short sleeping during the week
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.480]   and then at the weekend,
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.160]   you're out with friends or you're out sort of on the town,
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.240]   you go to bed late and you wake up late,
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.680]   and maybe you're doing that by two hours.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.800]   Maybe you're normally in bed by 10 p.m. during the week,
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.000]   but now at the weekends,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.280]   you're going to sleep maybe 12, 12.30
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.080]   and you're waking up two, three hours later
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.760]   on a Saturday and Sunday.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.040]   And then the problem with that, parenthetically,
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.640]   is on Sunday evening,
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.200]   you've now got to go back to work the next day.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.360]   So you have to push yourself back to 10.30 or 10 o'clock,
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.480]   whereas you were going to bed, let's say at 1 a.m.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.680]   on Friday and Saturday night.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.800]   That's a three-hour time shift.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.160]   And people are doing that very frequently.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.360]   That's the equivalent of you and I
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.600]   flying back and forth from Los Angeles to New York
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.800]   every single weekend in terms of our circadian rhythm.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.360]   And it's brutal on it.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.160]   But this is separate from this notion of your timing,
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.000]   the final part of the QQRT.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.440]   And by pushing your timing a little bit later
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.320]   into the morning when you wake up,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.360]   you will experience more REM sleep.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.320]   And as I said, when people sleep later,
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.680]   they go to bed later at night
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.760]   and they wake up much later in the morning at the weekend,
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.360]   I strongly suspect that if they paid attention,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.640]   they would say at weekends, I always dream more.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.680]   I always can remember my dreams and they're more intense.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.640]   It's not because there's something magical
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.120]   about how your memory recollection of dreams
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.240]   operates on Saturdays and Sundays.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.880]   It's because you've slept in later.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.440]   You've gone into that REM sleep rich preferential phase
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.400]   in the morning,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.680]   and therefore you've increased your REM sleep.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.920]   So I would say that that's probably the easiest way
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   that you can start to modulate REM sleep.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.680]   - So it's a terrific do.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.760]   And I think we can probably summarize the top don't
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.360]   as don't drink alcohol, because it abolishes REM sleep.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.240]   - Alcohol and THC are both very potent ways
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   that will remove or obliterate your REM sleep.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.640]   And we spoke about this in the episode on THC
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.400]   when we discussed this.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.600]   I think just yesterday, I got a very long email
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.640]   and I'm sure you get lots of emails
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.600]   from delightful people in the public.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.120]   And a gentleman just saying,
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.160]   I was using cannabis for probably about seven years.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.560]   And then I watched or listened to some of your content
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:11.560]   and I stopped and I just had this explosion of dreams.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   And I was never recollecting any of my dreams before,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.520]   but now they came back and goodness were they vivid,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.920]   they were rich, they were, and I could not believe it.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.000]   - And that's REM sleep.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.320]   - And that's because during the cannabis use,
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.520]   by way of the THC, not the CBD,
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.280]   you've been blocking that REM sleep.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.880]   You've built up that pressure
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.160]   just as we described in the dement studies.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.360]   And then when you finally do take away the agent
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.000]   that is blocking the generation of REM sleep, the THC,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.800]   all of a sudden your brain doesn't just go back
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.880]   to having its standard amount of REM sleep and dreaming.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.720]   It has that, plus it tries to get back as much of it
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.800]   as it possibly can by having what we call
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.200]   a REM sleep rebound.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.480]   And that's why people, when they stop using,
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.440]   they end up having this intense REM sleep.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.240]   By the way, to your point about reward
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.000]   and addiction sensitivity with sleep deprivation,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.720]   one of the things that we did in a collaboration,
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.800]   gosh, this was years ago when I was at Harvard
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.000]   with Carl Hart, who I think you, I don't know if you--
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.840]   - Columbia.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.000]   - Yeah, Columbia, you know him.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.760]   Yeah, he's a fantastic researcher,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.240]   a very interesting man too.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.440]   And what we found was that a lack of sleep
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.560]   was not only predictive of your addiction potential,
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.000]   but when you went into a clinic to abstain
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.960]   and trying to come off some of those,
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.440]   and here we were looking at cocaine addiction,
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.320]   a lack of sleep was a strong predictor of your abstinence
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.960]   and you falling off the wagon and going back to you.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.000]   So sleep is so critical,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.320]   not just for maintaining or pushing you away
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.080]   from that addiction potential,
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.200]   but once you are addicted and you're trying to abstain,
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.960]   it gives you that lift of altitude
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.040]   to try to resist falling off the wagon.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.640]   And when sleep gets short,
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.680]   that's when you become vulnerable again,
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:12.680]   probably because your reward circuitry becomes enhanced
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.080]   and all of a sudden you just cannot resist
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.440]   the temptation anymore.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.520]   I wanna take a brief break
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.920]   and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.320]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.760]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.280]   to help you better understand your body
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.200]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.960]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.040]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.960]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.560]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.000]   The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.400]   is that you get information back
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.620]   about metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.800]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.580]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.840]   to understand your results
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.960]   and they also point you to specific directives
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.120]   that you can follow in the realm of nutrition,
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.820]   exercise, supplementation, even prescription drugs
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.880]   that can help bring the levels back into the ranges
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.200]   that are optimal for you.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.040]   InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.080]   which enables coaches and health professionals
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.320]   to provide premium and personalized services
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.240]   by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.240]   and recommendations with their clients.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.780]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.220]   I think the takeaway is very clear.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.420]   In order to be your best emotional self,
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.660]   that is in order to be able to access positive emotions
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.100]   to their full amplitude, motivation,
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.500]   learning as we also covered in a previous episode,
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.140]   but also to stay out of those irritable,
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.620]   emotional traps of life and to be a regulated person,
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.940]   calm and joyful person, it stands to reason
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.680]   to minimize alcohol and cannabis use
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.960]   unless there's some medical reason
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.660]   why someone should do otherwise.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.540]   But the real take home message here
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.140]   is get as much rapid eye movement sleep as possible
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.020]   and don't do anything to inhibit it.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.220]   - Yeah, get as much sleep.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.580]   So focus on all of those four macros of sleep,
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.780]   quantity, quality, regularity, and timing.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.540]   And notice that if you want to try to optimize
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.740]   some of that emotional reactivity and balance,
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.180]   you may want to slightly over-index
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.780]   on your REM sleep in that regard
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.460]   and one easy, cheap way of doing that.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.100]   If you can, lifestyle permitting.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.140]   And again, of course I understand
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.100]   everyone has a life to live and pressures,
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.660]   but that's the way that if you were to ask me,
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.540]   can you do it and do it simply?
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.340]   Yes, you probably can.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.780]   - Great.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.860]   You touched on trauma a little bit already,
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.100]   but now would be the appropriate time, I think,
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.900]   to talk about PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder,
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   which I think we can use the definition of PTSD and trauma
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.180]   that the great Paul Conti,
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.500]   former guest on this podcast,
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.460]   who also did an expert series. - Wonderful, epic man.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.660]   - Yeah, an incredible man.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.780]   What a mind on him and what a generosity
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.460]   of sharing information in clear ways about mental health,
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.340]   as he did in the four episode series on mental health here,
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.980]   and he's been on other podcasts as well.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.060]   Wrote a marvelous book on trauma.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   Paul defined trauma as some event that is aversive,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.900]   that changes the way that our nervous system works,
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.900]   such that we function less well in the future.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.100]   It's not that every negative event,
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:31.100]   every negative emotion associated memory is trauma.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.100]   I think that's a misconception,
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.700]   but there are things that happen to people
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.580]   or that they observe happening to other people.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.140]   So there's first person trauma,
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:44.220]   third person observational trauma, et cetera.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.900]   And these can be single events, multiple events.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.440]   Sadly, this stuff happens.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.300]   It can be neglect.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.700]   So sometimes it's the absence of an event,
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.980]   which becomes the traumatic event
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:58.060]   that fundamentally rewire some component of neural circuitry
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.340]   such that we don't function as well
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.160]   in terms of relationship to anything,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.140]   work, food, sex, sleep, relationships,
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.740]   baseline levels of emotionality, and on and on.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.220]   - So what is the relationship between sleep
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.180]   and post-traumatic stress disorder specifically?
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.060]   I think some of what we've covered already
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.580]   certainly touches on this,
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:25.580]   but PTSD seems to me that it might be its own unique case.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:30.500]   - It is because if you look at the diagnostic criteria
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:35.340]   for PTSD, firstly, you see sleep disturbance.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.800]   And as I said, right at the top of this episode,
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.220]   there is no major psychiatric disorder
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.020]   where there isn't some mention of sleep problems
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.140]   in its diagnostic criteria.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.820]   But something else was intriguing about PTSD
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.420]   that compelled me to think about it
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.880]   and then create a theory around it.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.960]   It's not just sleep problems,
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.860]   it's also nightmares and specifically repetitive nightmares.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.820]   In fact, repetitive nightmares
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.380]   form part of the diagnostic criteria
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.480]   for you to receive a diagnosis of PTSD.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.820]   That's how reliable they are.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:16.300]   And as I thought more about this model of overnight therapy,
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.220]   this notion that sleep and particularly REM sleep
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.460]   provides a form of emotional first aid,
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:26.140]   PTSD stood out to me as something
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.860]   that I had to return to to explain.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.780]   Why?
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   Because if you think about PTSD and a veteran,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   it is the perfect example of the process that I described
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.760]   of emotional depotentiation failing.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.160]   Because what I started to realize is that in PTSD,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.760]   there is this trauma experience.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.000]   And then perhaps what's happening is that sleep,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.440]   the brain goes back to sleep that night and says,
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.840]   okay, please do your elegant trick
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.700]   of stripping away the emotion from the memory and it fails.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.120]   So then what happens the next night?
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.840]   The brain comes back and says,
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.920]   I'm sorry, but I still got this
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.760]   very emotionally charged memory.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.360]   Please do your elegant dissipation,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.560]   depotentiation of the emotion from memory and it fails again
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.040]   almost like this broken record that was so indicative
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.760]   of these repetitive nightmares.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   And then when you looked at PTSD,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.640]   I told you that REM sleep is a time
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.340]   of this remarkable decrease in noradrenaline.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.720]   But if you look at PTSD patients,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.080]   they actually have heightened levels of noradrenaline
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.400]   and also in the body adrenaline as well.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.480]   - In sleep.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.680]   - In sleep and also when you look
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.560]   just as a basal state as well.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.640]   So there's something not quite right
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   with the noradrenaline story in REM sleep in PTSD patients.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.640]   So I had just published this paper
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   and I was up at a conference in, I think it was Portland.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.180]   And I presented the theory that both the data
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.740]   that we had on healthy people.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.740]   And I put forward this theory of PTSD.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.460]   And then later that afternoon,
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.220]   a psychiatrist came on the stage called Murray Raskin
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.420]   and he was working a lot with PTSD vets.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.780]   And he described data, which I couldn't believe.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.020]   It's one of those moments, Andrew,
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.780]   where you're at a scientific conference.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.620]   And I think it happens maybe once in a career
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.740]   if you're lucky.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:40.740]   All of the hers on the back of my neck stood on sharp end
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.820]   because he was saying, we've got this data
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.720]   and we don't quite understand it.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.060]   We've been treating our veterans for blood pressure,
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.380]   for hypertension using a generic drug called prazosin.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:59.380]   And prazosin blocks the adrenergic response in the body
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.820]   because you're trying to sort of tamp down
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.900]   that sympathetic activation in the body.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.100]   - So it's a beta blocker.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.900]   - So it's an alpha adrenergic antagonist.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.740]   - Not a beta blocker.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.660]   - So it's not a beta blocker,
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.080]   but it's blocking the adrenergic system.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.060]   And so, and it's a generic, pretty cheap drug,
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.440]   but it turns out that it crosses the blood brain barrier.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.340]   So it doesn't just stay within the body.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.380]   It goes up into the brain.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.860]   And he said, we don't really understand it
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.660]   because I've been giving patients this medication
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.500]   and it works to a degree, but something else happens.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.740]   They come into the clinic and they say,
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.980]   doc, I'm not having those nightmares anymore.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.060]   They seem to have gone away.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.340]   And these patients seem to start to show signs of resolution.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.920]   So all of a sudden I had had a model,
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.520]   a clinical model that was in search of data.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.120]   And he had data that was in search of a theoretical model.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.280]   I couldn't believe it
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.080]   because it's exactly what I would predict,
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.400]   which is that if noradrenaline is too high in PTSD,
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.640]   you're not processing and stripping the emotion
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   from the memory.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.940]   So it keeps coming back over and over
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.080]   like this repetitive nightmare.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.500]   But then if you block and help bring back down
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.140]   that level of noradrenaline to that,
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.340]   which would be seen in a normal healthy person,
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.500]   in other words, completely blocking it,
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.340]   all of a sudden the emotional memory
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.300]   gets the chance to be processed
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.320]   and you finally start to get symptom resolution.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.420]   So we couldn't believe it.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.980]   He flew down to Berkeley.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.780]   We spent several days together.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.700]   We went out to dinner.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.780]   We just could not stop talking.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:44.500]   He subsequently did some incredible work in this area
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.740]   and prazacin went on to become
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.020]   an FDA approved medication for PTSD
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.260]   and repetitive nightmares
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.100]   that was approved by the Veterans Administration.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:55.940]   - Bravo.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.860]   - And so, no, it's not me.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.360]   It's all of his work.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.300]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.420]   You can't, no, this to me is the scientific collaborative
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.300]   conceptual equivalent of the old Reese's
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.820]   peanut butter cup commercials.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.620]   For those of us old enough to remember,
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.100]   it's two people running toward one another on the beach,
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.340]   one with a jar of peanut butter,
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.700]   one with a bar of chocolate,
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.060]   and then they crash into one another
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.400]   and then they both share in the delight
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.700]   of the chocolate peanut butter combination,
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.560]   which is an amazing combination.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.700]   But here, a far more important example,
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.200]   because it's led to clinical relief in patients with PTSD.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.620]   So I'm not making light of that at all,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.580]   but this is one of the reasons to go to scientific meetings.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.020]   Seriously, this is one of the reasons
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.380]   why scientists need to talk.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.980]   This is one of the reasons to do podcasts
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.940]   is it fosters hybridization of ideas,
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.900]   which is central to new discoveries.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.060]   And in this case, a clinical discovery.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.220]   I have a question about this notion
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.340]   of blocking norepinephrine in the brain and body.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.500]   On the one hand,
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.380]   it seems that during rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.180]   we know we're paralyzed or we are paralyzed.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.460]   That's a fact of rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   The brain is recalling memories often in great detail,
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.860]   sometimes through symbolic representation.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.980]   Space-time is disrupted.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.620]   It's either faster or slower because you're dreaming.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.360]   And it seems that there's something powerful
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.340]   about being able to replay the memories
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:36.300]   and yet divorce them from certain neurochemical release
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.260]   in the brain and body to essentially uncouple them.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.980]   And then to me, it makes perfect sense
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.380]   why taking a drug that would reduce
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.960]   the amount of sympathetic arousal in sleep would help,
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.460]   especially PTSD, because you said with PTSD,
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:52.640]   it's sort of an invasion of the noradrenaline response
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.300]   into rapid eye movement sleep that is inappropriate.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.060]   So does that mean that rapid eye movement sleep
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.580]   in people with PTSD is not truly rapid eye movement sleep?
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.460]   It's as if it's been abolished and replaced
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.620]   with something that's kind of pseudo-waking,
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   stress-invaded, you know, it's like a zombie REM.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.940]   And it's not good.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.780]   Is that correct?
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.140]   - It seems to be, and you can look at this
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:19.220]   in terms of the electrical activity of REM sleep,
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.540]   the electrical brainwaves of REM sleep in these patients.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.380]   And you're right,
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.860]   it doesn't seem to be of the same electrical quality.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   But what was interesting in Murray Raskin's studies,
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.060]   when he started to treat patients with the prazosin
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.300]   and tamp down that noradrenaline,
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.380]   one of the other things that returned back to normality
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.380]   was not just that the symptoms dissipated,
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:46.380]   the REM sleep started to return with a greater amount.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:50.320]   And so I think it fits very well with this notion
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.140]   that whatever REM sleep that was going on
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.660]   may not necessarily have been electrically
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:00.140]   or neurochemically identical to normative REM sleep.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.140]   But when you assisted the system with a chemical
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.660]   to bring it back into normality,
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.700]   REM sleep was gifted back to the brain
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.580]   and emotional resolution started to unfold.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.180]   Now I should note that there have been a number of studies
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.720]   that have replicated the finding.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.940]   Some studies have not though.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.200]   And so we still need to understand exactly
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.780]   why this is the case.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.860]   And there are other therapies that we'll probably discuss
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.960]   in a later episode on dreaming
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.740]   that are as if not more effective than that drug therapy
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:33.220]   for repetitive nightmares.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.620]   That is a psychological intervention
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.020]   rather than a pharmacological intervention.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.100]   And that seems to be very effective too.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.860]   - In 2017, as my laboratory was starting to explore
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.340]   some studies on humans on fear and trauma,
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.020]   I visited a trauma addiction center on the East coast.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.340]   The guy who runs it will be a guest on this podcast
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.220]   in the future, an amazingly talented trauma
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.100]   and addiction therapist by the name of Ryan Suave.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:05.420]   And there it was that I learned about Yoganidra,
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.620]   non-sleep deep rest.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.340]   And here's why, they were taking heroin addicts,
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.300]   gambling addicts, sex addicts, alcoholics,
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.580]   people with what they call behavioral process addictions
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.340]   and substance abuse addictions.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.500]   And every morning after they woke up,
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.220]   the first thing that they would do
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.420]   was one hour of non-sleep deep rest,
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.260]   you know, placing people into this liminal state.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.540]   And I asked why, and Ryan said,
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.060]   this is especially important to do with addicts
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.340]   when they arrive in inpatient recovery in the first week,
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.020]   and even more so in the first three days,
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.420]   because typically they are badly sleep deprived.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.100]   And in addition to that,
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.300]   many of them are just not good at getting
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.580]   and staying asleep at night without the use of pharmacology,
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.100]   or in some cases their behavioral addictions,
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.900]   depending on what it was.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.660]   And so it was a kind of a self-directed relaxation training
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.900]   of sorts first thing in the morning that in addition,
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.140]   perhaps could compensate partially
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.500]   for some of the sleep deprivation
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.660]   that they no doubt were experiencing when they arrived.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.020]   It's also a novel environment
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.140]   and sleeping in novel environments can be challenging.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.540]   So there is, as far as I know,
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:22.380]   no randomized control trials of this practice yet,
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.620]   but there are a good number of clinics and treatment centers
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.540]   that are now employing non-sleep deep rest, aka Yoga Nidra,
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.420]   for 30 minutes to an hour first thing upon waking
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:38.020]   as one of the core components of treatment
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.660]   for helping people get and stay sober.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.580]   - I think it's absolutely fascinating
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.300]   because that morning time period as well
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.700]   can be for those who are struggling with sleep,
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.820]   especially difficult.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.660]   And you and I have spoken on this podcast series
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.820]   about sort of awakening at night or later in the morning
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.460]   when you really want to be asleep
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.820]   and it's just a struggle to get back.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.620]   And as you noted that he was saying,
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.300]   they often come in underslept.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.780]   And my suspicion is that they're probably getting sleep
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.300]   at the front end in part because they're heavily medicated,
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.740]   but self-medicating in terms of helping their sleep.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.260]   But then of course, because they are asleep,
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.780]   they can't continue to medicate.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.820]   So which part of sleep is fragile?
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.460]   It's those morning hours.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.140]   And therefore, if you have something
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.140]   that is a compensatory tool
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.020]   that is not going to be the trigger of saying,
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.260]   just get back into bed, get under those sheets and sleep.
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.340]   Sleep doesn't work like that.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.660]   Sleep is not something that we do.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.220]   Sleep is something that arrives to us, with us.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.260]   And if it's not, you can't force it.
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.940]   And it's a bit like someone's name, in fact,
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.300]   quite the opposite that the harder you try to remember,
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.620]   the further you push sleep away.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.500]   And when you stop, it all of a sudden comes back.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.660]   But I love this idea of inserting something like that
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.060]   as a compensatory tool.
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.060]   And that's why I think you and I have discussed openly here,
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.980]   in fact, on this series.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.500]   At some point, we're going to collaborate
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.740]   and we're going to look to see exactly
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.620]   what is happening electrically
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.180]   at high fidelity mapping inside of the brain
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:18.180]   when we are going through these liminal states.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.420]   And what is the benefit of that?
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.340]   Is it a very similar benefit for sleep?
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.460]   And it's fascinating because it's possible
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.940]   that what we find at the level of the brain
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:31.900]   is that it's not sleep-like, it's something else-like.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.180]   Maybe it's just a liminal state-like.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.500]   And what's also interesting is that it provides
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.620]   seemingly many of the benefits of sleep,
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.340]   but it's not sleep.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.460]   In other words, you can arrive at the same destination
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.700]   of mental and physical health through two different routes.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.860]   One thing called sleep, one thing called these liminal states
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.660]   or they both operate on the same highway
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.660]   in terms of mechanistic transaction benefits.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.880]   So much that we need.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.080]   We could stay here all night and all day,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.140]   hopefully not all night.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.420]   - Well, we will absolutely do those studies.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.380]   And because I think that people are in desperate need
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:16.380]   of zero cost tools to try and access the replenishment
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.780]   and recovery that comes from sleep.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.240]   And when sleep is available to us, when we can access it,
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.580]   that's going to be the best option.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.420]   There's no question.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.060]   But then some of these tools in theory and in practice
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.740]   provide a portal to get better at sleeping as well.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.780]   - So yeah, I was going to say,
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.180]   one of the other things I'd be fascinated for us to do
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.980]   is not just look at that model
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.060]   of what happens in the morning,
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.060]   but can we use that for people
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.940]   who have the opposite insomnia problem,
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.900]   which is that I can't fall asleep.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.900]   And we spoke about this in a previous episode
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.580]   of tools and techniques and methods
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.640]   to help you fall asleep.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.380]   Could this be one of them?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.300]   Where you just start to help move yourself
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.260]   into this liminal state, you take the stress off.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.180]   One of the things I hear so much at the center
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.980]   when people come in and they say,
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.020]   I always struggle to sleep and you go into depth
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:11.140]   and it's because their mind starts to Rolodex
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.940]   through that anxiety of what I need to do
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.900]   and what I should do.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.060]   But also then the later it gets
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.200]   and the absent the sleep becomes,
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.020]   the more stress they get, not just about the next day,
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.060]   the more stress that they get about this thing
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.540]   called not being able to fall asleep.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.100]   And if there's something, a practice
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.540]   that you've taught someone that says, that's okay.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:36.220]   I know this place and I know this situation
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.660]   and there's a tool I have and it's called
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.140]   this a liminal state.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.140]   And if you were to train people on that sort of that method,
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:54.300]   is it a way that they finally can then cast themselves off?
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.700]   And it's the bridge, not necessarily just between despair
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.420]   and hope, but the bridge between wakefulness and sleep.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.140]   So put it at the back end, at the end of the day,
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.980]   rather than the front end.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.420]   - A lot for us to discover there.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:12.820]   And at risk of being hyperbolic,
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.700]   I mean, what would be more useful
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.380]   than a zero cost non-pharmacologic tool
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.420]   for people to get the rest and restoration they need
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.700]   and to get better at getting the ultimate form
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.160]   of restoration, which is sleep.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.900]   - Yeah, I love the paradox of it,
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.360]   that non-sleep deep rest allows you
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.140]   to go into sleep deep rest.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.280]   - It is after all a transition or liminal state.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.220]   Maybe this will become the stage
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.460]   before stage one of sleep, who knows?
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.460]   - We define our staging criteria.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.980]   - That's right.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.060]   Okay, so speaking of challenges,
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.060]   sleeping because of one's concern,
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.980]   aka anxiety about the importance of sleep.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.540]   What about the relationship between sleep and anxiety?
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.940]   Meaning many people in the world
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.660]   experience low level anxiety or have a low threshold
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.900]   to what could be a full-blown anxiety or panic attack,
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.460]   but more often than not,
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.460]   is this feeling of being tired and wired
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:17.260]   or having a quick pre-pulse startle,
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:19.460]   as we call it in our business, a nerd speak
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:24.460]   for kind of a reactive to input, anxiety.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.620]   And I don't think there's any clean definition
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.100]   between anxiety, stress, and PTSD.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.180]   These run along a continuum and they braid together.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.900]   - PTSD is an anxiety disorder, it's one of many.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.540]   - Right, these things braid together
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.500]   in a way that it would be a waste of our time
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.860]   to try and disentangle those.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.780]   But many people have anxiety that is anywhere
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.020]   from minor to debilitating,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.540]   but that is separate from PTSD,
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.500]   although people with PTSD can have anxiety.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.720]   So what do we know about the relationship
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.820]   between sleep and anxiety?
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.500]   And perhaps we could frame this in the context
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.940]   of the QQRT, you know, I'll just toss out a question
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.160]   that perhaps highlights what I mean.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.020]   Is it possible that somebody is getting eight hours
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.540]   of sleep a night, which for them meets
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.980]   their quantity requirement in the,
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.060]   the quality is relatively high,
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.500]   but it's not as high as it could be
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:23.260]   because the regularity and timing of their sleep isn't great.
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:25.560]   Is that person going to be more prone to anxiety
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.420]   than somebody who's really matched to their chronotype
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.620]   and is still getting enough sleep?
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.340]   - No one's done the head to head comparison
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.460]   where you kind of do the, how I can do,
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:39.460]   the Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper Sprite, QQRT challenge
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.840]   between all of those.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.160]   What we do know is that if you look at each one
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.920]   independently, QQRT, quantity, quality, regularity, timing,
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.100]   if any one of those is off,
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:55.640]   it's very difficult not to see a coexisting anxiety disorder
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.360]   or increase in anxiety or a mood disorder.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.680]   And I think to me, anxiety is part of that class
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.760]   of a broader class that I would call mood disorders.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.860]   It's relevant that we make that distinction,
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.480]   at least in my eyes.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.500]   And I know some people may disagree
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   because mood and anxiety are different than emotions.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.960]   And many of us clump them together.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:23.120]   The way I think about the difference is the following.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.800]   Timescale, emotions are short punctate events
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.680]   that usually last anywhere from seconds to many minutes.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.680]   Mood states, however, like anxiety or depression,
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.360]   those operate on a slightly different timescale
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.160]   from minutes to hours, to months, to years.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.200]   And so it's very unlikely
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.240]   that we can experience an emotional reaction
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.400]   that from a sort of a chronometry point of view
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.960]   lasts for two years.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.240]   But you can certainly see someone
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:01.400]   who has a mood state abnormality of depression
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.280]   that lasts for several years
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.500]   or who has been chronically anxious for several years.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.440]   And I'll come back to why I think that distinction
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.120]   is relevant for a second.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.440]   To your point though, about the relationship with sleep,
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.120]   here again, it's a very strong bi-directional relationship.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.440]   And I would say that probably in the last eight or nine years
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.720]   we've been doing a considerable amount of work
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.920]   in sleep and anxiety rather than just sleep
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.200]   and basic emotional reactivity.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.680]   What we found is it's very strongly bi-directional
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   that if you have anxiety, it's very difficult to sleep.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.160]   And if you are having difficulty sleeping,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.280]   it's very likely that you will increase your anxiety.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.200]   But before we really unpacked that,
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.680]   we started with a very basic study,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   similar to those that we've described.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.840]   We took a group of people and we were very careful
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.840]   to make sure that they had completely normative levels
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.560]   of anxiety, they showed no signs
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.080]   of an anxiety related disorder.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.720]   And by the way, anxiety disorders are,
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.440]   it seems one of, if not the most common
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.240]   of all psychiatric conditions,
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.120]   just to put it in context for people listening.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.280]   And these individuals, no signs of anxiety disorders
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.000]   whatsoever, they were normative.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.780]   And then we had them go through a full night of sleep
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.800]   or we then sleep deprived them.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.600]   And the next day we were measuring their anxiety
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.280]   and in those people who were sleep deprived,
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   we were actually measuring the level of anxiety every hour.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.320]   So we could almost get this time-lapse photography
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.920]   of what happened to their anxiety state
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.440]   as it unfolded across the sleep deprivation period.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   It wasn't a linear response, that the more and more hours
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   that you were awake beyond 16, the more exponential
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   that rise in anxiety became.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.120]   So it wasn't simply a linear dose response curve,
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.920]   it was exponential, meaning that there was
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.600]   this hockey shape swing up.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.680]   And in fact, by the next morning,
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.080]   compared to when you'd had a full night of sleep,
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.840]   those individuals were so anxious that almost 50%
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.560]   of the participants in that group who had no signs
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.480]   of anxiety before, had a level of anxiety
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.600]   that was so strong that they would reach
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:28.780]   the diagnostic threshold for having an anxiety disorder.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.760]   And that was simply by way of the absence of sleep.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.280]   But again, that brought me back to this notion
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.200]   of this is a good experimental tool for us scientists
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.000]   to understand what is the benefit of sleep
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.280]   when it's present and the absence of sleep when it's not
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.400]   by taking sleep completely out of the equation
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.200]   by way of total deprivation.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.420]   But of course that's not real life.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:54.380]   So we did a slightly different study.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.000]   Here, what we did was we tracked individuals
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.960]   essentially in the wild as it were,
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.880]   just going about their daily lives.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.320]   And we had different sleep tracking monitor,
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.000]   monitoring equipment on them.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.820]   So we were tracking their sleep from one night
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.600]   to the next, to the next, to the next,
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.160]   and from one day to the next, to the next,
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.160]   we were tracking their level of anxiety.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   And what we found here was that even small perturbations
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.920]   in their sleep from one night to the next, to the next,
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:28.880]   accurately predicted that increase or decrease
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.000]   in their anxiety from one day to the next, to the next.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.960]   What was the critical ingredient here?
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   Well, in the first experiment,
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.560]   I'd essentially manipulated both quantity and quality,
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.160]   the two QQs of the QQRT.
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.920]   I'd removed the quantity of sleep.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.920]   And also they had no quality of sleep, why?
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.640]   Because they had no quantity of sleep.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.640]   But when we looked at that day-to-day-to-day,
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.680]   night-to-night-to-night study,
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.200]   it wasn't quantity that was the best predictor.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.760]   It wasn't shortening of quantity
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.720]   that determined next day increases in anxiety.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.200]   It was quality.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.000]   The worse the quality was, night-to-night-to-night,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.860]   the worse their anxiety became.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:14.880]   So that started to lead us to think a lot more
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:18.360]   about what is it regarding the quality of sleep
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.280]   that seemed to offer when it was present,
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.520]   what I would describe as an anxiolytic benefit.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.560]   In other words, it's lessening anxiety.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.160]   A lack of sleep is an anxiogenic.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.240]   It's going to produce anxiety.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.720]   What in sleep is anxiolytic?
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.360]   We started off with a hypothesis
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.800]   that was profoundly incorrect.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.840]   We thought, well, for emotions,
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.600]   which are these short bursts of affective state,
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.120]   it was REM sleep that seemed to be the principal ingredient.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.480]   Well, wouldn't that be the case for mood states?
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.400]   Well, here with anxiety, it wasn't.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.080]   It was deep non-REM sleep, and we couldn't get away from it.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.000]   And so what we found was that when we looked
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.800]   at their sleep in the laboratory and asked,
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   what was predictive from the night before?
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.120]   So you measure your anxiety the night before,
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.720]   and then we measure it the next morning.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.560]   And basically we calculate a change score.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.640]   Has your anxiety the next morning increased,
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.280]   stayed the same, or decreased?
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.000]   And then we correlate that with the different stages.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.720]   And what we found was that the electrical quality
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.720]   of your deep non-REM sleep was very much predictive
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:35.520]   of your dissipation of anxiety overnight.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.560]   And this helped me realize, gosh, it's much more complex.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.880]   These are beautiful surprises you get from research
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.800]   when you have this hypothesis and you see REM sleep,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.080]   no signal of predictive relationship with anxiety.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.360]   And I say, of course, 'cause I'm idiotic,
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.680]   rerun the analysis, just go back to raw data.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.800]   And the REM sleep signal was so strong.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.880]   Rerun the analysis and you get exactly the same result.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.960]   It's deep non-REM sleep.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.920]   Great, okay.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.080]   Then what is that deep non-REM sleep doing
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.280]   to help dissipate the anxiety?
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.200]   But here again was a commonality with emotion.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.000]   What we found is that the greater the amount
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.400]   of deep non-REM sleep, the greater the re-engagement
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.440]   of your frontal lobe was the next day.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.000]   And that was predicting the dissipation
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.880]   of your anxiety the next morning.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.760]   So we really started to understand
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.680]   this sort of critical bi-directional relationship,
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   but it was a very complex one.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.320]   That yes, anxiety can disrupt your sleep.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.080]   And yes, disrupted sleep can predict your next day anxiety,
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.360]   but it wasn't the same stage of sleep
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.160]   that we thought before.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.680]   It was the opposite.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.720]   It was deep non-REM sleep.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.440]   What we've come to realize is that deep non-REM sleep
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.080]   in part seems to be almost shifting you
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.960]   from that sympathetic state
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.880]   over to the parasympathetic state.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.600]   It seems to engage that nice rest and digest.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.560]   It seems to reduce your heart rate.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.760]   It seems to drop levels of cortisol.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.680]   And we think that perhaps is a resetting brain body,
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.360]   literally an embodied mechanism
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.600]   by way of deep non-REM sleep,
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.880]   helping you just relieve that anxiety pressure.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.240]   So it does come back to your question,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.640]   which is yes, quantity if I manipulated,
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.240]   quality if I manipulated,
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.560]   regularity or timing,
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.520]   manipulate any one of those, I can change your anxiety.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.680]   But the story coming through here, if anything,
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.640]   was that it wasn't quantity, it was quality.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.160]   I told you that from one night to the next to the next,
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.400]   the quality of your sleep that we were measuring
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.600]   was predictive of your anxiety.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.160]   And then when we bring you into the laboratory
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.080]   and we look at the electrical activity of your brain.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.680]   I also mentioned in that episode on the first episode,
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.160]   another way we measure quality
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.440]   is not just subjectively what's going on
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.400]   or objectively what is the efficiency of your sleep?
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.120]   Is it filled with lots of awakenings,
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.520]   which was the measure that we used in the day-to-day study
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.080]   and night-to-night study.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.600]   But we looked at the electrical quality of your sleep.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.440]   Once again, it was quality that was predicting it.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:24.480]   It's something about getting good continuous sleep
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.320]   that is replete with this deep
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.480]   non-REM electrical brain activity
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.760]   that provides an anxiolytic benefit
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.680]   to your brain the next day.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.760]   And I think it's strategic
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.560]   'cause so many of us deal with anxiety.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.280]   And some of us would prefer
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.400]   not to necessarily be on medication or even look to that.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.560]   Well, here again is a strategic tool.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.240]   Think about your sleep.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.920]   It really does seem to be a buffer for anxiety.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.000]   - Along those lines,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.480]   maybe you can just recap a few of the things
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.960]   covered in previous episodes
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.240]   that are known to improve the quality
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.080]   and quantity of deep non-REM sleep.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:09.280]   I can think of a couple, but you're the expert here.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.280]   - Let's not rush to judgment on that one.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.920]   - I think it's an established fact,
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.640]   which is why you're here.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.880]   So let's perhaps list a few of those off
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.080]   in the domains of exercise, temperature, et cetera.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.880]   What would you place in that?
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.240]   Is there a top three, like three greatest hits
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.720]   for improving deep non-REM sleep
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.280]   because of its important relationship
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.800]   to anxiety management or reducing anxiety?
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.640]   - I think there are.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.360]   The first thing I would tell you
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.480]   is that regularity is going to be key here.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.080]   When you are giving your brain the signals of regularity,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.080]   it understands exactly how to instigate that deep sleep.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.640]   And that's one of the two qualitative measures
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.560]   of sleep that I spoke about.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.360]   So QQ, the quality, the second Q I spoke about,
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:04.080]   it's regarding the continuity of your sleep
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.000]   and the actual quality of your sleep.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   Regularity is probably best for the continuity of your sleep.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.760]   If you're very irregular with the timing of your sleep,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.920]   your brain almost doesn't know,
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.120]   are we on, are we off, are we on, are we off?
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.520]   And your sleep can become quite fragmented
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.200]   because it's confused based on regularity.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.840]   When you give it regularity,
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.320]   sleep starts to become more stable.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.960]   More stable means that it's less likely
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.640]   to be littered with awakenings,
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.840]   meaning that it's better quality of sleep.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.400]   In terms of electrical quality of sleep,
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.120]   we did mention this in a prior episode
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.320]   when we spoke about sort of food and exercise.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.400]   Exercise seems to be one of those things
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.000]   that's very good at improving the quality
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.200]   of your deep sleep.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.920]   And here I'm talking about the electrical quality
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.680]   of your deep sleep.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:59.640]   Try to make sure that you're physically active to a degree.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.680]   And I think this is a protocol
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.960]   and I think it's a meaningful protocol,
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.360]   but to go so to the extreme where I were to say,
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.800]   you need to do at least 32 and a half minutes
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.600]   on a spin bike at this wattage or, you know,
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.160]   we can't prescribe quite at that point,
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.200]   you know, scientific prescription, not medical.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.480]   And so I would say exercise is one.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.480]   Then we spoke about another, which was temperature.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.520]   And we said that getting your bedroom cool
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.800]   seems to be a way to promote the increase in deep sleep.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:34.800]   So these are two dos, which is get regular, get cool.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:39.200]   The don'ts, we've already spoken a little bit about too.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.400]   One of the things that I probably didn't mention enough
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:46.040]   with alcohol, not only does it seem to compromise
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.200]   your rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.040]   but it will fragment your sleep.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.120]   It will make your sleep more unstable.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.920]   And an indirect consequence of that is alcohol
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.200]   is going to be in highest concentrations in your system
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.600]   after drinking in the evening with sleep
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.400]   in the first four to five hours.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.520]   Now that depends on how quickly you metabolize it
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.400]   and how much you've had,
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.240]   but let's assume some degree of standardization.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.280]   In other words, I said that alcohol
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.800]   will not just block your REM sleep,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.160]   it will fragment your sleep,
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.280]   makes your sleep more vulnerable to you waking up.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.000]   Well, you're especially vulnerable
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.160]   in the first four or so hours
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.000]   because that's when alcohol concentration
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.800]   is highest in your system.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.080]   And therefore the first four hours can also fall prey
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.080]   to the greatest culling of your sleep quality.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.800]   And if you're removing or restricting some of that quality
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.880]   in the first four hours,
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.600]   what type of sleep are you principally restricting?
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.960]   You're restricting deep sleep
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.400]   because we've said deep sleep comes in the first half,
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.960]   dream sleep, REM sleep in the second half.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.160]   So don'ts would be try to stay away
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.880]   from excessive alcohol in the evening.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.200]   We also know that alcohol is associated
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.360]   with longer term chronic anxiety.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:02.120]   And the tragedy is that it's often used
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.400]   as a way to blunt the anxiety
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.240]   because alcohol is a sedative
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.560]   and it can help just alleviate, take the edge off,
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.320]   but it's a short term "win" for a long-term loss
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.040]   'cause overall it will increase anxiety levels.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.680]   So I would say those are some dos and perhaps a don't
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.160]   if you want to try to optimize your sleep quality,
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.640]   including the integrity of your sleep
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.960]   and also the electrical quality of your sleep.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:30.800]   - Terrific.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.760]   I think because so many people struggle with anxiety
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.960]   ranging from mild to severe anxiety,
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.400]   the tips you just provided
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.400]   are gonna be immensely beneficial.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.520]   And in addition to that,
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.040]   the previous four episodes
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.520]   that we've recorded for this series,
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.440]   each and all include tools that is protocols
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.560]   for improving the QQRT aspects of sleep.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.520]   So all the more reason for people to dig into those
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.880]   and to glean the gems that you've laid out for people
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.680]   because they really are very actionable.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.480]   And most all, perhaps even all of the tools
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.320]   that we've discussed in those episodes are zero cost.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.120]   They require a little bit of time investment,
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.080]   some thought and consideration,
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.720]   but they're not really that difficult to implement.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.960]   They just require a little bit
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.000]   of being one's own scientist of self.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.400]   - And be in your own corner when it comes to sleep.
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.640]   And I love the low cost method that we mentioned
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.320]   was not just temperature
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.480]   in terms of keeping your room cool,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.280]   but warm bath or shower before bed.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.800]   I mentioned improved sleep,
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.720]   but one of the things that improves most
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.160]   is deep non-REM sleep.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.840]   So there's another technique,
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.880]   get your room cool to go into,
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.240]   but warm up to cool down to fall asleep,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.400]   which then keeps you cool so that you stay asleep
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.520]   and you'll get more deep sleep.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.480]   - Fantastic.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.720]   Although it's a terribly unhappy topic,
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.200]   suicide is an important topic for us to cover here.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.800]   I can think of few things more tragic than suicide.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.040]   And yet sadly, it accompanies
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.120]   certain psychiatric conditions.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:21.480]   I think people with menopipolar have a 20 to 30
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:25.360]   times greater probability of suicide than others,
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:30.360]   but suicide accompanies major depression, anxiety, PTSD.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.760]   Again, it's a tough topic to get into,
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.520]   but an important one to get into.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.520]   What is the relationship between suicidality and sleep?
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.840]   And then I suppose we could look at this
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.480]   from the perspective of to what degree
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.200]   does sleep deprivation correlate with suicide
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.920]   or attempted suicides?
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.920]   And what sort of inoculatory effects
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.240]   does sleep provide towards suicide?
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.760]   - Unfortunately, we don't know much
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.280]   about the second part of the question,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.440]   which is how can sleep be used
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.840]   as a risk mitigating tool when you know
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.440]   that there is the risk of suicide in place?
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.400]   There's been a number of people who are doing this work,
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.880]   including my colleague, Alison Harvey,
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.640]   again at the University of California, Berkeley,
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.280]   and Sherry Johnson, who's also there too.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.400]   I would say though that the first question
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.680]   is quite answerable, which is what do we know firstly
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.560]   about how a lack of sleep can impact suicide?
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.480]   Some of the earliest data that we found
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.000]   were associational relationships.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.240]   What we found is that short sleep
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.440]   or poor quality of sleep predicted three things.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:45.480]   It predicted suicidal ideation,
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.760]   meaning that you had thoughts of suicide.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.040]   Bad sleep seemed to predict suicide attempts.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.760]   And then tragically more recent data,
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.120]   a lack of sleep predicts suicide completion.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.880]   And what makes me think more causally about it,
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.800]   and we've been trying to get some grants
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.680]   and we failed to do so so far to do more of this work
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.760]   because I'm just so compelled by it.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.240]   And you're right, it's one of the most tragic situations.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:19.080]   Those sleep relationships aren't simply happening
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.480]   at the same moment in time.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.160]   What I mean is that the sleep disturbance
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   that we see precedes the onset of having suicidal thoughts.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.960]   It precedes the onset of suicide attempt
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.080]   and it precedes the suicide completion.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.280]   So what this has been teaching me
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:40.400]   is I've been looking at the data
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.600]   and we've looked at a little bit of our own data.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:45.400]   Sleep disruption when it comes to suicide
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.360]   is almost the canary in the coal mine.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.160]   It's almost like a tragic crystal ball
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:55.920]   that when you see that sleep starting to dismantle,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.880]   it is a foreshadowing sign
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.400]   of a very dark series of events that will unfold.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.640]   In other words, could we now start to think,
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.800]   and this is one of the things that we want to do,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.160]   is sleep a biomarker, is sleep disruption, I should say,
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:18.160]   a biomarker for upcoming suicide risk before it begins?
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.080]   The idea of finding a biomarker
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.800]   or collection of biomarkers for suicide,
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.840]   I think is one of the more important missions
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.480]   of neuroscience, AI, and mental health generally.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.360]   There's a brilliant young researcher
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.400]   up at the University of Washington named Sam Golden.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.000]   He's spent a lot of his career studying animal models
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.440]   of aggression and rage.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.120]   And of course, some forms of suicide
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.160]   are thought to be forms of self-directed aggression
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160]   and rage, if it makes sense.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.640]   Some forms of suicide perhaps are different.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.080]   I don't think we quite understand
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.240]   what suicide represents in the brain just yet.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.080]   And I think having spoken to Paul Conti
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.000]   and others about suicide,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.640]   it's clear that there are unfortunately many paths to suicide
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.240]   and there isn't one brain state.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.520]   Nonetheless, Sam's laboratory has been developing tools
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.200]   that help people with suicidal tendencies
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.680]   or people who have had suicidal ideation
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.960]   or plans in the past
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.480]   with these AI-based tools where it detects changes
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.600]   in their voice, in their sleep patterns,
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.040]   and in a few other metrics that I don't recall
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.680]   that together become very good predictors
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.480]   of later suicidal ideation.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.880]   So the idea here is that people who are prone to suicide
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:50.200]   often don't realize that they're drifting that way
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.680]   until it can sadly be too late.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:57.680]   So the point here is, A, biomarkers are key.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.200]   B, these biomarkers are being developed.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.920]   C, AI is critical, but that according to Sam,
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.880]   changes in sleep patterns is absolutely central
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.480]   to these algorithms for allowing people
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.760]   to detect their own potential for suicide.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.800]   - I think it's critical, and we thought about this
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.000]   when we started to see these sleep signals
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.960]   that were preemptive, that were almost precognitive
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.120]   in the sense of prediction,
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.720]   occurred to me that we're at the stage
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.400]   of technological evolution,
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.800]   that if we get consent of many individuals
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.120]   who become suicidal,
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:40.680]   they are interested in some degree of support.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.360]   And we often, but of course, some people will just recoil
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.560]   and go into themselves,
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.320]   and that's when things can get very problematic as well.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.200]   But it would require some degree of consenting
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.200]   that if you have a history of suicide ideation in the past,
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.400]   what if you were to be able to consent and say,
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.240]   "I would like to risk mitigate,"
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.160]   and you have a wearable, like a watch,
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.880]   and that watch is connected to your phone,
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.720]   and there is a signal that can come from your watch
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.320]   that dials a series of phone numbers
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.520]   in order of preference.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.000]   And when your watch starts to detect
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.040]   that your sleep has this,
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.720]   and one of the things we really want to understand
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.560]   is what is the specific signature of sleep abnormalities?
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.080]   It's not just that your sleep gets short,
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.560]   but is it that your sleep gets long and then short,
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.760]   and then long and then short,
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.840]   but it constantly has poor quality of sleep,
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.040]   and the regularity is all over the place,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.480]   but the chronotype timing is still in place.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   What sort of specific pattern of those things
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.520]   is the hallmark that is most predictive of suicide?
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.440]   Let's say that I can come up with that algorithm finally,
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.640]   and then we can implement it into a watch
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.040]   or a tracking device of some sort.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.440]   And when it starts to see that pattern,
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.760]   it's constantly pattern matching,
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.160]   and it starts to see that
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.440]   across whatever number of days we say,
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:14.440]   if you see this across six nights or across 13 nights,
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.120]   this is serious.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.920]   It then triggers that phone
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.000]   to send a message to those individuals
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.680]   who are the designated support carers.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.400]   And those people then reach out and start to say,
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.360]   how are you doing?
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.960]   Would you like to have a phone call?
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.280]   Can I come over?
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.040]   Can I make you some food?
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.600]   And I'd love to have a chat with you.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.520]   Can you find a way to bootstrap a condition
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.760]   where you constantly then otherwise become asocial
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.160]   or antisocial and lose all support network?
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.440]   So that would be the sort of the grandiose idea.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.360]   The other thing that's very interesting
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.720]   is that we could measure the activity
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.320]   and their wakefulness at night.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.480]   And the reason I bring this up is some great work
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.160]   by Michael Perlis and Michael Grandner,
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.480]   who've looked at suicide,
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:10.920]   both attempts and suicide completion
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.360]   across the 24 hour period.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.160]   It's not constant.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.680]   It's not that you see suicide ideation
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.600]   and suicide attempts and completion
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.880]   in a distributed manner equally across the 24 hour period.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.960]   When do they principally occur?
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.000]   They occur in the late middle of the night.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.600]   And there's this almost four to five hour period,
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.560]   somewhere on average, and again, it's just an average,
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.360]   somewhere between let's say 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.,
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.360]   which turns out to be right at the lowest dip
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.040]   of your circadian rhythm, and it could be circadian rhythm.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.920]   But I also think that there is something about,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.520]   of course, the nighttime-ness when no one else is around
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.280]   and it is just you, bad point number one.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.920]   Second, as we've spoken about before on this episode,
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.680]   negative thoughts are 10 times worse
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.680]   in the darkness of night than they are in the light of day.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:16.160]   And third, at that point, if you're awake,
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.760]   you're not asleep.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:20.720]   And we know sleep is providing this ballast
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.160]   to your mental health.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.960]   So on all three of those counts,
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.800]   you see this very strong spike in suicide ideation,
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.920]   suicide attempt, and also suicide completion
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.160]   in this bewitching hour in the middle of the night.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.760]   There is a final piece in the suicide story, though,
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.240]   that is only just emerging.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.520]   If you are not getting sufficient sleep,
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.920]   you are somewhere between two to three times more likely
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.960]   to go into that suicidal state,
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.840]   which is a very significant number.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.840]   However, when people started to measure another factor
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.720]   of sleep and particularly dream sleep,
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.600]   which was the dream content itself,
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.880]   it became even more predictive.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.880]   And we've not really seen this very much
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   in psychiatric conditions.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:13.040]   But what they found was that instead of using
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.720]   your sleep disruption or your lack of sleep
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:18.400]   as a predictor of your suicide risk,
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:22.880]   we use nightmares as a predictor of your suicide risk.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.280]   That predictive value, that risk,
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.200]   went from about two to three times more likely
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.200]   to somewhere between five to eight times more likely.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.960]   There is something special going on with bad dreams
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.880]   and specifically nightmares that is even more predictive
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.280]   than this physiological thing that we call sleep itself.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.360]   And we'll probably come on to maybe some of the reasons
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.600]   why dreaming and particularly nightmares
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:54.360]   in the next episode on dreaming
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.080]   could explain exactly why that is.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.560]   But it's a new finding.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.240]   I don't think we can say much more about it now,
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.240]   but it is one of the most, I think, novel findings
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.840]   in the psychiatric sleep story
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:10.840]   that now dreams have come above and beyond
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.080]   simply sleep itself as a predictor of mental illness
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.320]   and specifically a form that will take your life
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.920]   tragically very quickly.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.480]   - When I think about depression,
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.960]   I immediately associate that
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.880]   with excessive amounts of sleep.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:31.600]   After all, it's called depression.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.400]   But what is the real link between major depression,
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.400]   which is the classical signs of malaise,
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.000]   one of the hallmark features also being
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.240]   a lack of optimism about the future
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.640]   or and/or ability to sense into the future.
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.040]   That's what, it's not the only criteria.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.040]   When Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.960]   the great neuroscientist that he is,
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.440]   was on this podcast.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:04.640]   And of course, he's also a practicing clinical psychiatrist.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.020]   When we were talking about depression,
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.400]   he mentioned that another hallmark of major depression
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:12.040]   is people waking up at two or 3 a.m.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.480]   and not being able to fall back asleep.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   This just seems like a recipe for disaster all around
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.220]   that the very condition that you're trying to
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.640]   perhaps ameliorate with additional sleep
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.200]   is preventing you from sleeping.
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.880]   It's like the, can't imagine.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:28.720]   - It's very cruel, isn't it?
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.920]   - A whole lot of things more diabolical
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.000]   in terms of the sleep science.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.100]   So what's the relationship between sleep and depression
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.680]   and how should one untangle that
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.960]   like seemingly Gordian knot?
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.760]   - It is like the other conditions,
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.760]   bidirectional, that depression can disrupt sleep very much.
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.940]   And disrupted sleep can trigger depression.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.580]   Depression is interesting, by the way.
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:57.320]   Some people have conceptualized it
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.320]   as being different to anxiety based in some ways on memory,
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.180]   which is that when you think about anxiety,
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:09.380]   people consider anxiety a disorder of the future,
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:11.220]   that you are constantly worried
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:13.820]   about what's coming up in the future.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.600]   I didn't do this today, so I need to do that tomorrow.
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.220]   And then I've got that other thing next week,
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:22.460]   or I'm fearful of going out to see them tomorrow.
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:25.900]   I just, I'm fearful of taking that flight tomorrow.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.300]   It seems to be so much about prospective future.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.300]   Whereas other people have suggested
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.180]   depression is the opposite.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:36.940]   It's about rumination of the past.
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:39.900]   I went through this event, I had this bereavement,
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:42.100]   I had this painful divorce.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:46.180]   I just can't get over my past.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.900]   Now, I don't necessarily know if that's entirely true,
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:54.580]   but it is interesting in the sense that both of those,
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:58.580]   abnormal prospection, worry of the future,
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:03.580]   and abnormal retrospection, sort of ruminating on the past,
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:06.900]   seem to disrupt sleep.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.340]   - Before you continue,
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.220]   I just wanted to drill into that idea just a little bit,
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.240]   'cause I think it's a really interesting one
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.460]   worth exploring.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.860]   Again, I'm no psychiatrist,
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.300]   but I have heard, and I've experienced,
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.580]   I've had a depression.
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.660]   I think it's, my understanding is it's normal
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.260]   for people to experience a major depressive episode
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.820]   at some point in their lives.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.180]   Could be situationally triggered or not.
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:34.620]   But that for others, unfortunately,
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.940]   they have repeating major depressive episodes.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.780]   And hopefully some people go through life
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.700]   never having had a depressive episode.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.460]   But as I recall, one of the more salient
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:49.180]   thought patterns was that I used to have something
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.260]   that somehow was lost,
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.060]   and I couldn't quite figure out what it was.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:55.140]   It was this recurring feeling of, right,
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.580]   like things were on track, and then they got off track,
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:00.900]   but not being able to tack the progression
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.300]   from on track to off track to one particular event.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:04.860]   It was this sort of sense that like,
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.340]   I had something that then was lost.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.860]   Now, fortunately for me, it eventually lifted,
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.020]   and it didn't get dangerously bad.
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.420]   But I've had some close friends
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.740]   who've gone through individual or several major depressions.
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.100]   And I hear this, like this idea that they had it,
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:24.380]   or they think something was there that then they lost.
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:25.940]   So I think I agree with your assessment.
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:26.780]   - It fits very well.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:28.340]   If you think about the word that you just used,
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:33.340]   had is about, it's the past.
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.860]   It's past tense.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.660]   - Right, and then if we apply the criteria
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:40.100]   that is indeed part of the criteria
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:42.140]   for determining if somebody has major depression,
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.220]   which is a lack of optimistic outlook on the future,
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.660]   one can see how one could be very much stuck in the present
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:48.700]   and focused on the past,
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:51.820]   and just stuck in that spin cycle.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.100]   Anyway, we're not here to decide
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.540]   what depression is or isn't in every case,
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:58.380]   but given that-
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.740]   - Yeah, I'm not a psychiatrist either.
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.380]   - Right, but I think this distinction
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.740]   between anxiety being about the future
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.420]   in a way that disrupts one's present,
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.420]   and depression being about often the past
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.380]   in a way that disrupts one's sense of the present
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.540]   and the future, makes a lot of sense.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.820]   It's just a nice, not nice, it's unfortunate,
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.820]   but it's a useful contextualization, yeah.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:24.180]   Thank you.
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.780]   - And to your question though about sleep,
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:32.060]   it's been a little bit interesting with depression.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.500]   Firstly, what we know is that depression
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:37.420]   will disrupt your sleep and make your sleep shorter.
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:41.620]   And it comes back to your comment from Karl,
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:43.060]   from Karl Deisseroth.
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:46.140]   We often see that patients will have problems
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.140]   staying asleep.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.620]   They wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.380]   they can't get back to sleep.
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:51.660]   It's problematic.
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:54.500]   And therefore their sleep duration
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.980]   and their sleep quality decrease.
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:58.740]   However, on the other hand,
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.860]   there is an interesting question by the way of,
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:02.660]   can you get too much sleep?
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.260]   Which I should probably come back
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.540]   'cause there's a whole episode to do on that probably.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:10.300]   But one of the places where we see quote unquote,
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.140]   too much sleep is in the depression literature.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.180]   And it's a condition that we call hypersomnia.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:21.620]   In other words, increased or excessive degrees of sleep,
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.500]   hypersomnia.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:28.500]   But a great PhD students at Berkeley looked at the data.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:33.100]   Kate Kaplan is a fantastic cognitive behavioral therapist
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.260]   now and a clinical psychologist,
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.900]   looked a little bit at the data
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:38.900]   and others have looked at this too.
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:44.540]   When you examine what people were asking those patients
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.100]   where there is this conclusion
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.740]   that patients with depression can sleep too long.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:51.660]   Really what they were asking in those studies
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.660]   was what time do you go to bed?
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.580]   And what time do you wake up?
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.220]   And there, what you clearly find
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:01.300]   is that people with depression will be in bed
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.220]   for significantly longer periods of time.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.380]   And the inference there,
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.540]   and you could argue almost the conflation
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.140]   is that if you're in bed for longer,
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.500]   then you're sleeping for longer.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:17.220]   And therefore depression is a condition of hypersomnia.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.220]   But when people looked at this a little bit more
[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:21.780]   in a nuanced way and asked a different question,
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:23.580]   what time did you go to sleep?
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:25.660]   And what time did you wake up?
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.380]   That hypersomnia phenomenon is nowhere near as strong
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.500]   as you would have been led to believe otherwise
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.500]   from the, what time did you go to bed?
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.860]   And what time did you wake up?
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.740]   And I think part of the reason comes back
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:41.380]   to depression as a condition.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:42.660]   When you think about depression,
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:45.220]   one of the aspects, one of the features
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:47.540]   is that you're depressed to the point
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:50.500]   where you just don't want to interact with the world.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:55.460]   And what better place to spend if that's your mentality
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.060]   than this thing called bed?
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:59.660]   I just don't want to get out of bed.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.180]   I'm just going to stay here and lie in bed.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:03.100]   I'm awake, I'm not asleep.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:06.020]   And so we don't quite know yet if depression
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.740]   is a condition that is associated with long sleep.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:11.700]   We certainly know it's associated with short sleep
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:15.660]   and disrupted sleep, or that is masquerading
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:17.180]   as this thing called hypersomnia.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.060]   But when you really look at the data,
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.260]   it's not quite so clear.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:27.340]   That was the first peculiarity in depression
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:30.380]   that there could be this paradox of yes, long sleep,
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:33.220]   but also not enough sleep, too short sleep.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.980]   One of the earliest findings in depression and sleep
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.220]   and has been quite well replicated
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.460]   is a change in REM sleep.
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:43.820]   But now it wasn't necessarily that individuals
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:46.700]   who had depression slept
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.780]   or had excessive amounts of REM sleep.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.940]   They had a little bit more.
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:55.740]   What was interesting is that when that REM sleep emerged
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:58.660]   during the night was much earlier.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.860]   And in the first episode, I was telling you that
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.500]   when your head hits the pillow,
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.420]   you go down to the light stages of non-REM,
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:06.300]   then into the deeper stages.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:09.420]   And then maybe after about 50, 60, 70, 80 minutes,
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.220]   you'll pop up and you'll have your short REM sleep period.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:16.740]   But that first REM sleep period in people with depression
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.620]   seemed to have been called up by the brain
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:24.020]   abnormally or not much earlier.
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:27.300]   So it's what we call REM sleep latency.
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:29.620]   From the moment that you fell asleep,
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:32.180]   what is the time, what is the latency
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.100]   of the first arrival of REM sleep?
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:39.020]   And that REM sleep latency was significantly shorter
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.220]   in those people with depression.
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:43.780]   REM sleep was arriving earlier.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:46.180]   Now it's hard because you can argue,
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.340]   and these are the most dangerous hypotheses,
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.900]   you can argue both sides of it.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:52.580]   You can say, well, perhaps that's because,
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:55.820]   Matt, you also spoke to me that REM sleep may be important
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:58.700]   for some aspects of the emotional brain.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:00.020]   And when you are depressed,
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:02.540]   the brain knows that REM sleep is required
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:07.380]   and it calls it up on the menu of the series of dishes
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:10.620]   that you're going to be served earlier on in the night
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.180]   because it's needed more significantly.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:17.860]   The other, and that's the adaptive theory,
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.860]   the other is the maladaptive theory,
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.700]   which is that arriving with your REM sleep too early
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:27.540]   does not do your brain good things,
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:32.540]   and therefore it's some abnormality of emotional processing.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:35.380]   The data that's interesting there
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.980]   is that if you look at some antidepressants,
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:41.900]   many of them will either delay the onset of REM sleep
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:44.460]   or they will reduce it significantly.
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.220]   Now there's a huge debate about the efficacy
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.620]   and the utility of antidepressants,
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.700]   and I don't have a horse in that race
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:54.180]   and I don't know enough about that literature to comment.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.980]   I would simply say though that it's at least intriguing to me
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:02.100]   that some medications that are commonly prescribed
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:06.460]   as antidepressants will alter specifically REM sleep
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:10.980]   and push it later or try to reduce it down.
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:14.260]   And that would fit with the maladaptive hypothesis
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:17.900]   that this arrival of REM sleep so early in depression
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:21.300]   and perhaps having a little too much REM sleep isn't optimal.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.940]   And when you push back against that with pharmacology,
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.620]   i.e. antidepressants,
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.900]   you seem to get some degree of resolution
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:32.540]   or reduction in the depression symptomatology.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:35.780]   Again, I don't think we clearly understand that.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:42.100]   Another strange thing that has been often cited to me
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:46.220]   many times about sleep and depression
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:48.260]   is a literature that suggests
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:50.620]   that if you deprive people of sleep,
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.300]   which time and again in this episode we've said
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:56.180]   leads to bad outcomes for mental health,
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:59.540]   it does exactly the opposite in depression.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:03.620]   That if you sleep deprive a depressed patient,
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.260]   you get a resolution of the depression.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:09.140]   And that is the claim that's often made to me.
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:13.740]   Now, it is a very clear set of data in the literature,
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:17.020]   but there are two potential concerns with it.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.660]   The first concern is that
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.340]   not all patients respond to sleep deprivation.
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:23.620]   In fact, if you look at the data,
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.980]   it's somewhere between 30 to 55% of patients
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:31.060]   will be responders to sleep deprivation.
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:34.300]   The other proportion of those patients don't respond
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:37.820]   or if anything, get worse when you sleep deprive them.
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.740]   And then the question is, well, how would you know?
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:43.420]   And right now, and there've been some brain imaging studies,
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:46.820]   some PET studies done way back at UC Irvine
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:49.340]   and other locations where they were trying to say,
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.380]   is there something about the metabolic activity
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:52.900]   of your brain that can predict
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.620]   if you're a responder or not to sleep deprivation?
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:58.100]   'Cause at least then we would know
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.660]   who should we push through this "treatment"
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.780]   and who should we not because it's going to be bad for them.
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:06.300]   That's the first issue.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:08.180]   And we don't have a clear understanding.
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:11.580]   The second issue is that as soon as those patients
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:14.980]   with depression sleep after the deprivation,
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:17.180]   the antidepressant benefit goes away
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:19.860]   and they go right back to being depressed again.
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:23.660]   So yes, it's a mechanistically interesting process.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.500]   What is it about sleep deprivation
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.660]   that could alleviate depression?
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.580]   And I'll explain why I think it can.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.740]   But it's not a sustainable one.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.940]   It's not a clinically viable one.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:39.980]   Why would it have that effect if it does?
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:43.060]   Well, you and I discussed earlier in this episode
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:44.740]   that when you are sleep deprived,
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:46.420]   not only does your emotional brain
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:49.420]   become much more responsive to negative things,
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.420]   it also becomes much more responsive
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:53.940]   to rewarding positive things.
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:55.100]   And one of the interesting things
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.820]   that I think people mistake about depression,
[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:01.900]   they just think that when I'm depressed, I have sad mood,
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.540]   I have negative mood.
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:05.540]   That's not entirely true.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:07.820]   One of the principal features of depression
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:10.500]   is something that we call anhedonia,
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:13.420]   which is an absence of having the ability
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:15.660]   to have hedonic responses.
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:18.580]   In other words, you can't get pleasure
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.980]   from normally pleasurable things.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.380]   It's not an issue about sliding down to the negative.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:29.180]   It's the absence of being able to experience the positive
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:32.300]   that puts you on a track towards depression.
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:34.660]   And what you and I discussed earlier in this episode
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.580]   is some of the work that we've been doing,
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.740]   where when you sleep deprive individuals,
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:40.860]   but you show them very rewarding based stimuli,
[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:44.060]   they become much more reward sensitive.
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:48.260]   And perhaps this is why patients will respond
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:50.180]   to sleep deprivation with depression,
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:51.940]   because they're too far away
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.980]   from that positive end of the spectrum.
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:55.820]   They're not reward sensitive enough.
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:58.900]   They don't get a positive, good feeling.
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.180]   Now, if you're someone who is healthy
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:02.140]   and you're sleep deprived,
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.860]   you go too far in the reward direction
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:07.860]   and you become vulnerable to reward and sensation seeking.
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:10.620]   But if you're depressed and you're shifted
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.220]   to sort of away from that,
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:15.620]   and sleep deprivation brings you back closer
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:19.340]   to a normative reward based reactivity,
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:21.140]   maybe that's the reason why you get
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.980]   this antidepressant benefit
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:25.860]   and why when you start sleeping again,
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:29.700]   you take away that enhanced reward sensitivity
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:33.780]   and you lose the antidepressant benefit.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:36.220]   So I think we still don't know enough
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:40.140]   about depression and sleep yet.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.980]   If you were to ask me of the four,
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:45.300]   quantity, quality, regularity, and timing,
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:47.020]   which would be ideal,
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:51.420]   I would say all four are definitely players,
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:54.460]   but timing may have some of the best evidence
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:57.100]   because it's not just about sleep
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.300]   when it comes to depression,
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.860]   it's also about your circadian rhythm.
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:04.580]   That if you are not aligned with your natural chronotype,
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:09.580]   your natural 24 hour rhythm, circadian misalignment,
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:11.460]   when you fall out of synchrony
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:13.740]   with your natural chronotype
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:17.300]   is a strong predictor of depression.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.780]   So if there is an actionable item,
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.420]   first, it would be to say
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:23.300]   from a big picture perspective,
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.940]   understand that sleep is one of the
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:33.860]   least painful available options for you
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:37.980]   as a no cost to try to stabilize your mental health.
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:41.420]   Now, I'm not suggesting that all psychiatric conditions
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.180]   are sleep disorders, that's not true.
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:46.900]   And I'm not suggesting that you should stop
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:50.100]   simply at the place of getting your sleep straight
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:54.140]   to help with your mental conditions, not at all.
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.220]   I am saying, however,
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:57.900]   that if you do get your sleep straight,
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:00.260]   it's only going to help and may help
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:04.100]   quite a significant amount based on the data.
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:05.540]   But when it comes to depression,
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:08.580]   I would say of those four, QQRT,
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.540]   there's a very strong emerging data
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:12.420]   that circadian misalignment,
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.580]   not matching your chronotype to the time
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:17.260]   when you are sleeping and the time you are awake
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.740]   is one of the strongest factors.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:22.700]   So if you want to say, I can't do all of them, Matt,
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:25.300]   I can't do all of this QQRT nonsense,
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:27.740]   just tell me one of them to start with.
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:29.940]   I would say, don't worry, we'll get to the three others.
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:32.340]   Let's just start with getting your timing right.
[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:34.380]   Let's understand what type you are.
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:37.660]   Take the, go online, you can take one of these tests,
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:41.340]   the MEQ, the Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire.
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:43.300]   You can just Google it, it's free, you can do it.
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:44.900]   - We'll write a link to it in the show note caption.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:46.140]   - That's great.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.660]   Understand what type you are,
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:50.620]   and then try to understand based on what time
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:52.420]   I'm currently awake and asleep,
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:53.940]   is it matched, is it mismatched?
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:55.260]   And if it's mismatched,
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.740]   try to see what you can do
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:59.140]   with your lifestyle accommodating, of course,
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:00.300]   to match that.
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:04.220]   Things will more than likely start there getting better.
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:08.300]   - Along those lines, and if I may,
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:11.140]   I'd like to just mention a recent study
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:14.300]   that I think dovetails with what you just said beautifully,
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:16.900]   and seems highly actionable to me.
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:21.300]   This was a study published in Nature Mental Health,
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:23.100]   which is a relatively new journal,
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:29.140]   but it involved exploring the light exposure
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:31.140]   and dark exposure patterns of,
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.760]   I believe it was more than 80,000 individuals.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:35.440]   I'll have to go back and check that.
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.140]   But what was interesting is that
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:40.940]   when they looked at light exposure,
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.940]   in particular sunlight exposure,
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:44.700]   and they looked at darkness exposure
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:47.180]   across the 24-hour schedule,
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:50.260]   what they concluded was that
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:52.420]   there was a near linear relationship
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:55.580]   between the amount of light that one gets in the morning
[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:57.740]   and throughout the day,
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.380]   and reduction in mental health challenges
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.140]   in terms of depression, PTSD.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:05.020]   There were a few others.
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:08.180]   Some of the effects were less robust
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:09.900]   for certain psychiatric conditions
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:11.780]   than they were for, say, depression.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:13.660]   What was equally interesting is that darkness,
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.060]   the absence of light,
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:18.140]   turned out to be as important a variable
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:20.460]   as light during the day.
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:24.480]   Made simple, if people tended to be in dim
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.660]   or dark light at night,
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:30.540]   they experienced reductions in their suicidal,
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.780]   depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms,
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:35.020]   independent of how much light
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.420]   they were getting during the day.
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:38.580]   So what this says is get as much light
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:42.180]   as one can possibly and safely get in their eyes,
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:44.220]   by the way, in the morning and throughout the day,
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.500]   and then do one's very best to be in very dim
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.700]   or dark environments at night.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:53.540]   Even goes so far as to say that
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:56.100]   if you didn't get sunlight during the day,
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:59.220]   then you would be especially well off
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:01.140]   being in a very dark environment at night.
[02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:03.300]   - And it's independent, so don't worry.
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.540]   Yes, it's always good to get that daylight,
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:08.340]   but what that paper also teaches us
[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:11.460]   is that because those things can be independent,
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.980]   you can still get some benefit,
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:17.380]   even if though you've not made a good on your daylight
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:20.060]   during the day, getting that darkness at night
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:21.900]   is still going to be beneficial.
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.220]   And I should probably resolve
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:25.460]   what some people may think of as confusing.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.540]   We spoke about, for example, suicide risk
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:31.020]   and it being highest in the depths
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:32.700]   of the darkness at night.
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:34.620]   I think what's clear from that paper
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:39.180]   comes on to one of the fundamental conventional tips
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:42.100]   that we spoke about in how to optimize your sleep,
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:44.260]   not just an unconventional, but the conventional,
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:48.060]   which was, I told you, we are a dark deprived society
[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:53.060]   and we need darkness at night to help keep our sleep regular.
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:57.340]   So the sort of the R in the QQRT.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.460]   And I think there in that paper, the inference of course,
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.820]   is that if you're getting dark at night,
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:07.060]   it's going to give you a nice sleep onset signal
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:11.100]   so that you are asleep at night in the darkness.
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:13.740]   And that sleep at night in the darkness
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:16.660]   provides this beneficial, you know,
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:21.540]   sort of not immunization, but at least palliative help
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.420]   to certain psychiatric conditions.
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:26.420]   We're not suggesting that darkness at night,
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:29.940]   if you're awake at night, however, is beneficial.
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:32.900]   That seems to be not beneficial,
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:36.460]   but it was such a great paper and very elegant
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:40.540]   in how it dissected the independent nature of these things,
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:42.020]   which fits very well with, I think,
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:43.940]   your mission in part in life,
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:46.060]   both as a scientist and as an educator,
[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:50.460]   which is how can I curate information, gather it together,
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:54.540]   and give you some type of actionable boots on the ground,
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:57.580]   feet in the trenches advice as to what to do.
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:07:59.100]   It was a great paper.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:00.460]   So thank you for bringing it up.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.180]   - Yeah, I only wish I'd done that study,
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:04.660]   but I'm so glad that others did.
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:06.100]   One thing that's been helpful to me
[02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:11.100]   to encourage more darkness and dim light at night
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:12.900]   for myself in my home environment
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:17.180]   is to think about artificial photons
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:18.460]   coming from artificial sources
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:21.980]   as sort of empty calories at night
[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.980]   and how sunlight provided one isn't getting a burn.
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:27.700]   And people debate how best to do that.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:29.420]   Physical barrier, everyone agrees on,
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:31.620]   certain sunscreens are safer than others.
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:34.240]   Some are very safe, some are perhaps less safe.
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:36.180]   In any event, the point is that
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:40.060]   trying to make one's home environment dark at night
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:45.060]   is in my mind now akin to trying to avoid eating sugary,
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:49.260]   non-nutritious calories at night as well.
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:53.840]   It just lends itself to just overall feelings of wellbeing,
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:56.660]   improved sleep, and of course, improved daytime wakefulness.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:01.100]   And then getting sunlight even through cloud cover
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.980]   in one's eyes early in the day,
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:06.820]   and as much as safely possible throughout the day.
[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.100]   And if one can't get sunlight,
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:11.060]   getting light from bright artificial sources
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:12.700]   seems to be the best alternative.
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:15.540]   But I think there's this asymmetry
[02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:17.440]   of light-dark requirement in the same way
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.060]   that I think most everyone agrees
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:21.620]   that eating during one's active hours of the day
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.060]   is going to be the best way to go,
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:26.140]   as opposed to eating during the less active hours
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:29.700]   of the late night and certainly prior to sleep.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:31.020]   - Such a good point.
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.940]   And since it's only you and I here
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:35.660]   and no one else watching and witnessing this,
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:39.660]   I am thoroughly going to steal that phrase of junk light
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:40.940]   and help educate people,
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:42.740]   because that's a perfect description.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:44.220]   - It's like empty photons.
[02:09:44.220 --> 02:09:45.980]   - Yeah, you've all heard of junk food.
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:48.120]   Well, there's something called junk light.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:52.420]   And if you get your whole foods during the day,
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:56.060]   just like you get your whole kind of encompassed light
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:57.900]   during the day, that's great.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:02.900]   But then if you start binging on junk light at night,
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:05.980]   it's profoundly deleterious to your sleep
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:08.980]   and everything that sleep depends on.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:10.100]   It's lovely.
[02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:13.780]   So when people hear me in future public spheres
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:16.620]   talking about junk light, you know where it came from.
[02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:17.980]   I will give you full credit.
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:19.500]   It's a delightful statement.
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.380]   - 'Cause I may have lifted it
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.340]   from somebody else inadvertently.
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:25.580]   - We all stand on the shoulders of other giants.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:26.400]   - That's right.
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:28.180]   Or other Twitter accounts or something like that.
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:31.180]   - Well, I place myself firmly underneath a pedestal,
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:34.300]   but yes, we all try to stand on the shoulders of giants.
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:36.100]   - Well, wherever you place yourself,
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:39.220]   the information that emerges from you
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:42.460]   and that emerged today is absolutely spectacular.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:45.220]   You know, I can't think of topics more interesting
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:49.820]   and important than emotion regulation, anxiety, PTSD,
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:51.500]   suicide, sadly, depression.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:55.900]   All of these things are tragic challenges,
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:58.900]   but they are a real part of life.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:01.300]   Some argue even more so nowadays,
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:04.060]   perhaps even because of the advent
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.080]   of so much artificial light and smartphone use
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:06.920]   in the middle of the night.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:08.260]   Who knows?
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.700]   I think it's reasonable to assume
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.560]   it's at least one variable.
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.560]   Today, you've provided a ton of depth of understanding
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:20.700]   about why sleep and these mental health
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.140]   and emotional states are linked.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:24.740]   It's just a really clear logical framework
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.220]   for both the non-REM sleep and REM sleep
[02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:32.020]   and how it impacts mood and reactivity during the daytime.
[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:34.660]   And also some really actionable tools
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:39.220]   to improve one's mental health and emotionality, excuse me.
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:42.560]   And in addition to that, we'll refer people back
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.840]   to episodes one, two, three, and four,
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.920]   all of which include tools to improve every aspect of sleep
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.360]   and to really nail down the QQRT, that quality.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.840]   Do you put quality first or quantity?
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.680]   - Quantity. - Quantity.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:56.500]   I'm just making sure.
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:59.240]   That QQRT to really nail down the quantity,
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:01.880]   quality, regularity, and timing of sleep.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:05.400]   We can no longer consider sleep just six to eight hours
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.920]   or get your nine hours or get your seven hours.
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.720]   Clearly there are other variables involved
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.080]   and you've made those variables very clear to us.
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.120]   And you've given us the roadmap
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.880]   to plug in the best variables for ourselves.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:21.400]   So thank you, Matt, ever so much.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.660]   - Thank you for allowing me to both voice
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:27.840]   and narrate the important story of sleep and mental health.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.360]   It's something I'm immensely passionate about,
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:31.920]   both from a personal perspective,
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:35.560]   but also from a professional research perspective.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:37.120]   Thank you for this opportunity.
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:38.640]   - Well, again, thank you, Matt.
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.840]   And I'm very much looking forward
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:44.960]   to the sixth installment in this series on sleep,
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.160]   which is about a topic that everybody is fascinated with,
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:50.760]   which is dreaming.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:53.760]   I know you're gonna tell us about dreams and what they mean,
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.760]   perhaps what they don't mean.
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.600]   We'll get into dream interpretation of all things,
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:01.440]   lucid dreaming, and much, much more.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.920]   So I really look forward to that discussion in episode six.
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.780]   Thank you for joining me for today's episode
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:08.320]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.

[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.120]   I do read all the comments.
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:49.120]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:50.620]   we discuss supplements.
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:52.760]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.800]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:56.160]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.160]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.680]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:00.940]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.500]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.360]   That's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.600]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:11.340]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:14.820]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:16.320]   And on all those platforms,
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.620]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:20.120]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:21.580]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.420]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:24.920]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:28.220]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:29.380]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.120]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.000]   our Neural Network newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.720]   that provides podcast summaries,
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.280]   as well as protocols in the form
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:39.340]   of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.960]   that cover everything from neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:44.040]   to sleep, to deliberate cold exposure,
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.460]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.480]   We have a foundational fitness protocol, and much more,
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.480]   all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.520]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the Menu tab,
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.760]   scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:57.180]   and by supplying your email, you can subscribe.
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:58.020]   I want to point out
[02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:00.300]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.640]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:03.760]   for today's discussion all about sleep
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.360]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.400]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.440]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:12.020]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:14.600]   (upbeat music)
