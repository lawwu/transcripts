[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   For our brief meditation this morning and in order to prepare our minds for our thinking
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.120]   this day and tomorrow and all these days round about Christmas Day, I would call your attention
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.680]   to the first verse in the second chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.080]   And it came to pass in those days that they went out to decree from Caesar Augustus that
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.000]   all the world should be taxed.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.920]   I really want to look at that phrase "those days" and I do that of course because they
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.400]   emphasize the historical character of the Christian faith.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.640]   Now that is a very good reason and indeed in my opinion the main reason for observing
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.200]   Christmas Day at all.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.320]   You will know many of you how many of our fathers and grandfathers and great great great
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   grandfathers felt that this is something that should not be done.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.600]   They reacted of course against the abuse of this observance by Roman Catholics and others
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.940]   who brought in the whole idea of the mass and many other pagan ideas.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.480]   But surely we must agree that our fathers tended to react a little bit too much and
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.980]   went too far.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.760]   In this sense only that they tended to encourage those therefore who pay less and less attention
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.080]   to the actual historicity of these events.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.320]   Now it is extraordinary that one should have to go on saying this kind of thing.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.400]   But doubtless many of you have read the articles in the various newspapers during this past
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.880]   week and if you have done so, as I have done, you will have come to the conclusion that
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.200]   we need more than ever to emphasize the fact that the Christian faith is a faith that is
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.120]   based upon facts.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   Now there are two main wrong attitudes to this at the present time.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.920]   The one is, there is nothing new about this of course, but I have to mention it because
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   it is still being repeated as if it were something new.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.320]   The one is to deny the facts altogether and to say that these are fairy tales or what
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:45.680]   they now call myths by which they mean not so much that they did not happen at all and
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.840]   that there is nothing here as that these are just stories which are meant to convey some
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   great and profound truth.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.920]   That is one attitude, that which would deny the facts altogether.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.220]   But there is a second attitude and to me this second one is even worse than the first.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.120]   The first is in a sense ridiculous because secular history itself recognizes and acknowledges
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360]   these facts as I am going to show you in a moment.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.700]   But this second attitude I feel is worse and it is the attitude that says this.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.560]   It does not matter whether these things did happen or not.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.840]   You see the first view says that they did not happen.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   The second view says it does not matter whether they happened or not because they say whether
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.560]   these events literally took place and we have got to dismiss the stories of the birth in
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   Bethlehem in the stable of the inn and so on.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.440]   Whether it happened or not really does not matter at all because we still have this wonderful
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   teaching and this is the thing that matters and that counts.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.320]   As one of them put it in an article this week, the psychological influence still remains.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.960]   The influence of the stories still remains and therefore the facts in a sense do not
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   matter at all.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   And one of them in an article which I read quoted a man like the late Mr. Gandhi to that
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.080]   effect and she was pretending to write as a Christian whereas Mr. Gandhi always said
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.120]   that he was nothing but a Hindu and had never been and never wanted to be a Christian.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.360]   But you see this is the attitude that the facts really are irrelevant.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.240]   That what matters is the psychological effect of reading all that we have in the New Testament
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.200]   upon us and that the psychological effect is to make us feel better, to make us feel
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.160]   more friendly and well dispersed towards others and to fill us with a desire to help them
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.280]   and to relieve suffering and to do good and so on.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.400]   So now that of course is as I say the very worst form of denial of the Christian faith.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.360]   To start with it's got no answer at all to those who reject the whole of Christianity
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.600]   in terms of psychology.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.520]   It plays straight into their hands.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.640]   It likewise has no answer to give to the cults that are around and about us at the present
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   time.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.120]   The cults can do people a lot of good and they do it simply in terms of suggesting,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   suggesting a certain teaching, suggesting to people that they're better and that they
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.200]   should be better and that they should be helpful and so on and so forth.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   And that reduces all this to nothing but a form of psychological teaching calculated
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   to make us all better people than we were before.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.680]   Now the fallacy of course behind all that kind of attitude is this, that it reduces
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.720]   the Christian message to a teaching, to an elevating teaching, an uplifting teaching,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.600]   a very noble teaching.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.040]   But after all it's nothing but a teaching.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.680]   That's their attitude that what we've got here is a point of view with regard to life,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.880]   an attitude to life, an excellent attitude and that this is the thing that the world
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.240]   needs and therefore what we should be concerned about is to get the spirit of this message
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.720]   into men and women so that they'll be better people and live better lives and as a result
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   we shall have a better world.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.800]   Now that I say is not only the greatest denial of the Christian faith, it is in many senses
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   the most hopeless attitude to life that is conceivable for this reason.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.200]   The world has been trying to put itself better by means of teaching for so long and patently
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.280]   it can't do it.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:10.300]   And so if we are left this morning with nothing but an exhortation or a stimulus or the psychological
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.320]   suggestion of noble and wonderful teaching, well the end is that we are still left to
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   ourselves and you and I have got to do it.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.240]   We've got to take up this teaching, we've got to remind ourselves of it constantly and
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.360]   we've got to be repeatedly putting it into practice.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   But it leaves it entirely to us and if we happen to be people who are not interested
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.640]   in reading and in intellectual matters and in idealism and so on, well then it's got
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.700]   nothing at all for us.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.320]   If we're the victims of drink or of drugs or of anything like that, it's got nothing
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   to give us at all.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.080]   It simply comes to us and tells us that what we are doing is wrong, we ought to be better
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.360]   and we ought to be living a better life.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.040]   Let's read this New Testament and try and catch this spirit and so on.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   What's the value of that to people who are the helpless, hopeless victims of sin and
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.760]   evil and iniquity, who've lost their interest and lost their willpower and lost everything
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   else?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   Now we are living in a world like that and if the message of Christianity is simply some
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   sort of psychological teaching, well then I say we are left in a completely and entirely
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.200]   hopeless position.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.360]   But my dear friends, all that is a travesty of Christianity.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   We are here this morning to celebrate a fact, to celebrate an event.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.800]   In those days there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.720]   This is a history book.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.840]   It's as much a history book as any other history book.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.080]   And here we are reminded that we are in the realm of concrete facts and events.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   And what I want to do now very briefly and hurriedly is to give you a number of thoughts
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.280]   or ideas or principles if you like, which you can think out for yourselves and work
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.400]   them out at leisure, concerning this whole matter of the relationship of the Lord Jesus
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.160]   Christ to time.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.480]   Now that's the thing that is emphasized by Christmas Day, that at a given point in history
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.720]   the Son of God came into this world.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.760]   Now that's not an idea, that's not a psychological suggestion or teaching, that's an event.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   It's a fact.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.720]   And you see, this record and the other records will insist upon our observing the detailed
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   facts of history.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.680]   They even tell us here this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.000]   and you can check that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.160]   You can check that from the secular history books and you'll find that it is correct.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   And on it goes.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   This is a great book of history.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   You see, we are told here that Joseph and Mary went up because Joseph was of the house
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   and lineage of David.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.480]   In other words, they kept registers.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:12.120]   We are in the realm of registers, record offices, genealogies, family trees.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.360]   That's what we are concerned about, not with some wonderful elevating teaching which can
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.560]   suggest better things to us.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.960]   We are concerned and thank God for it.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.400]   It's what makes Christmas Day Christmas Day.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.200]   God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.680]   It's something that's happened and it's happened in time.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.640]   Well now, look at the staggering nature of this event which took place.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   What does the Bible tell us about this?
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.320]   What does it tell us about that babe?
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.240]   What is his relationship to time?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:54.080]   Well the first thing it tells us about him always is that he was before time.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.960]   In the beginning was the word.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.160]   And beginning there, remember, means well before the beginning, when there was no beginning.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.000]   It's before the beginning.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   That means eternity.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.960]   That means that he always was.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.680]   That there was never a time when he wasn't.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.760]   Now this is the fundamental proposition of the Christian faith.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.280]   We are not here to celebrate the birth of a great man.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.080]   It's all right to celebrate the birth of great men and all concerning their lives and their
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.820]   activities, but that is not what we are doing.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:38.360]   We are here to commemorate, to bring to mind, to think again of the coming of the eternal
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.840]   Son of God out of the eternity into time.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.220]   In the beginning was the word.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.000]   And the word was with God and the word was God.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.480]   Or if you prefer it, take the way that the Apostle Paul puts it in writing to the Corinthians
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.120]   in that famous second chapter of his first epistle.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.600]   He says he was being criticized, you remember, by certain people in the church at Corinth
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.320]   for not being sufficiently philosophical.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.640]   You see, people were the same in the first century as they are now.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.260]   They wanted ideas.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.960]   They wanted philosophies.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.160]   They didn't talk about psychology then, but they meant exactly the same thing.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.720]   And they were criticizing the Apostle because he always kept the facts.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.400]   He was preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.240]   So he answers them saying, "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.680]   of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to naught."
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:46.240]   Listen, "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:54.720]   ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.880]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.080]   Here, you see, is this same idea.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.360]   Before the world, before the creation of the world, before time, before any of these things
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.880]   had come into being at all, he was.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.520]   You see, we are looking into the great eternal mystery of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.640]   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.600]   You can't understand Christmas unless you start there.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:37.640]   These three persons, co-existent, co-eternal, co-equal in every respect, the three in one,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.760]   of course, an everlasting mystery that our poor, feeble minds cannot hope to grasp and
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.840]   comprehend.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.200]   But that's the way to look at Christmas.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.080]   You look at that child, but you don't start there.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Where's he come from?
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.720]   And he's come from before time, out of time.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   He's come from the eternity itself.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.840]   So then, the second step which we have to take is this, and it's a thing which you
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:13.040]   find repeated so often in the New Testament, that he was manifested in time.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:20.240]   Now that's how the description is always given, that there he was in eternity, and
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.760]   God's great plan for salvation was there, elaborated, but at a given point in time,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.400]   it all was made manifest.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.240]   Now here is a great and a controlling idea in the Scriptures.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.440]   Let me just read some verses to you, for you to see exactly what I have in my mind.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.680]   It's a vital part of the Scriptural teaching.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.920]   Take, for instance, Paul's first epistle to Timothy in the second chapter, where he
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.480]   puts it like this, in the beginning of verse three.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.560]   He says, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God, who will have all men to
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.760]   be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   Then, here it is, "For there is one God, and one and only one mediator between God
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:20.960]   and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time."
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.400]   That's the idea, testified in due time.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.440]   Or take it again in the next chapter, 1 Timothy 3, 16.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.600]   "Without controversy," says the apostle, "great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Why?
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.560]   Because God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   That's what we are celebrating, that the one who was outside time, beyond time, before
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:16:00.160]   time, timeless, has entered into time, manifested in God, who was manifest in the flesh.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.000]   Now, here is the thing that happened, you see, at Bethlehem, that there is a manifestation,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.200]   a revealing, a coming into time, and a visibility in time of the invisible and the eternal God.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.760]   Or, the apostle Peter tells us exactly the same thing in his first epistle, again in
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   the first chapter.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.480]   Listen to it like this, "Forasmuch," he says, "as you know, that you were not redeemed
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.480]   with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:41.400]   from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:50.560]   without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:58.160]   manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God."
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.920]   Now, there's the idea, and I could give you endless other quotations.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.040]   Keep your eye on that.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   It's the way to understand the mystery of this birth that took place there in the stable
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.920]   of the inn at Bethlehem.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:20.560]   It is a manifestation in time of the one who is outside and beyond time.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   And then there's another aspect of this matter that I must put before you.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.680]   Did you notice that verse in the hymn that we've just been singing, the great hymn of
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:36.520]   Charles Wesley, the second verse, "Christ by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   Lord."
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:46.720]   Now listen, "Late in time, behold him come, offspring of a virgin's womb."
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.840]   Late in time, behold him come.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.160]   What does Charles Wesley mean by that?
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.520]   Well, that's a most important principle.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   There's a great mystery here, but it is an essential part of the whole of the biblical
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.000]   message.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.800]   You see, you must go back to the creation.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.960]   Why did this birth take place?
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.120]   Why did the eternal come into time?
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.560]   Why is the invisible God taking on this visible form?
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   Why?
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.200]   Well, the answer is, and it is the only answer, he came because of the state of the world,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.120]   because of the state of mankind.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.360]   He came to redeem.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:39.040]   He said himself, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.400]   But the question that people often ask is this, why didn't he come earlier?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.200]   You read the account of the creation of man, how he was made in the image of God and that
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.680]   he was perfect, and God put him into a perfect environment.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.200]   But man foolishly listened to the temptation and the suggestion of the devil, and he rebelled
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.240]   against God and he fell.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.040]   And he brought down misery and unhappiness upon himself, and he was driven out of paradise.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:16.160]   He was thrown out, and God set a guard at the entry into the garden, the flaming sword,
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.360]   you remember, and the cherubim, preventing men getting back to paradise.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:28.240]   Now from that moment, the history of the human race has been one of misery, unhappiness,
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.800]   striving, trouble, pain, and trouble.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:39.160]   The world has been, ever since men rebelled against God, as it is this morning, a world
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.200]   of trouble and of sorrow, pain and unhappiness.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.520]   There it is.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.800]   And man has been striving to get back into paradise.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.120]   He's been doing his utmost.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.680]   That's the whole story of civilization.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.120]   But he can't do it.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.000]   He's failed completely, and he's failing as much this morning as he's ever done.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.080]   The world is pronouncing the truth of the Bible by living as it is at this present time.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.760]   And what we are celebrating is this, what God has done about this situation.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:18.280]   He has sent his Son into the world in order that the world through him might be redeemed.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.040]   But people often ask, "Why didn't he come at once?
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.960]   Why didn't the Son of God come?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.520]   Why wasn't he born immediately after the fall of man, the moment man was thrown out of paradise?
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.960]   Why didn't he come then?
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.520]   Why this long interval?"
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.800]   Now, whatever your view may be of biblical chronology, we can at any rate be certain
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.400]   of this, that even accepting the most conservative figures, which have been traditionally accepted
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:55.160]   the chronology of Archbishop Usher, there was at any rate 4,000 years from the fall
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.440]   of men to the birth of the Babe of Bethlehem.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.000]   And since then, there has only been, well, not yet 2,000.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.120]   We are coming to the end of the 2,000th year, at the end of this century.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.280]   So you see that Charles Wesley is right.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.960]   Late in time, the centuries have passed.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.480]   But suddenly he comes.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:25.400]   He comes at this point in those days when the decree went forth from Caesar Augustus.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.320]   Why so late in time?
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:36.440]   Why were all the centuries allowed to pass before God sent his Son into the world?
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.840]   Well, there is an easy answer to give to that.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.400]   There is no trouble.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.760]   And the answer is this, my dear friends.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.920]   Man is so stubborn in his foolish self-regard.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:57.560]   Man is so madly confident of his own innate powers and abilities that he had to be convinced
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.680]   that he could not save himself.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.800]   You see, if the Son of God had come almost immediately after the fall of men, well, then
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.320]   men would have said, "Ah, but if I'd only been given a chance, I could have done it
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   myself."
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.200]   God didn't give us a chance.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.360]   You see, he developed this enmity towards God.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.320]   His mind was set against God.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.720]   He rebelled against God.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.040]   And he is now confident that he can handle things himself.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.160]   And if God had sent his Son, then men would have said, "Ah, we could have done it."
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.680]   Very well, God gave him at least 4,000 years in order to prove to him that he couldn't
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   do it.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.440]   He did it in time.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.360]   Read your history, my dear friends.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.280]   Read the biblical history.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.440]   Read the story about how God gave people, these children of Israel, a law and said to
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.740]   them, "If you can keep this law, you can save yourselves.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.360]   You say you can.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.240]   You rebel against me.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.080]   You say that you don't need my help.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.820]   Very well, you're always turning to other gods.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.800]   If you think you can do it, well, get on with it.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Do it.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   Here's my law.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   That's how I ask you to live.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.400]   Keep that if you can."
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   And they couldn't do it.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.000]   And by when the babe of Bethlehem was born, it was obvious that they couldn't do it.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.680]   The apostle Peter puts it on one occasion by saying that it was a yoke that was grievous
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.560]   to bear and more than our fathers could bear.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.160]   Nobody could keep it.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.680]   But not only that, you see.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.760]   God gave ample time to the great civilizations that you can read about in the Old Testament
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   and in secular history books.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.920]   The great civilization of Babylonia.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.880]   We think the world is wonderful today, and it is in a sense, but you know, relatively
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.480]   speaking it's no greater than it was in the time of Babylon.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.040]   You read the story of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.840]   Here is civilization.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.640]   Here's men going to put everything right.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:06.680]   So it came and it went, followed by that of Medo-Persia, the Medes and the Persians.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.160]   Then you come to the great story of the Greeks.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.560]   Here at last are the people who are going to put the world in order.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.000]   The philosophers.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.160]   The others were warriors and kings.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.280]   They've got their wise men, their seers, but at last here's a nation of thinkers,
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.440]   philosophers, great men of understanding.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.960]   These are the men who are going to put the world right, and they taught and they brought
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.000]   their plans of utopia.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.200]   They are going to put the world in order.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:43.280]   It all went, the glory that was Greece, typified by the Acropolis and so on.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.360]   There it is, the failure of the nothing.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   And after that, the great Roman Empire, with its law, its legal system, its local government,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.960]   its devolution of government, the masterpiece in a sense of local government as devised
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.760]   by Rome, all that had been and had come.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.840]   And the world was still in trouble and pain and still lost.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.200]   Late in time, that's why.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:16.480]   He could have come at any time, but he comes after all these centuries of striving and
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.800]   useless, futile, vain effort.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   Why?
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.840]   Well, to show the world and to establish to the whole of mankind that man cannot save
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.080]   himself.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.000]   And so he comes late in time.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.480]   But thank God I don't leave it at that.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:43.420]   I add immediately to that, though it was late in time, it was in the fullness of time.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.240]   You remember the great statement of the apostle to the Galatians?
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.840]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:05.560]   It's late, but it's only late in the sense that the centuries have passed.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.480]   It's not late in God's timetable.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.240]   We are accustomed to timetables that are not kept.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.080]   The bus isn't on schedule, the train is late.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.240]   There's the schedule, but it isn't kept.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.160]   Not so with God, my friends, in his relationship to time.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.840]   Oh yes, it's very late if you look at it from the standpoint of the long story of the
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.640]   human race.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.200]   But it's not late in the sense in which we generally use that term.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.120]   It doesn't mean that something has gone wrong.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.240]   No, no.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.640]   When the fullness of the times was come, God's appointed time, the time that was planned
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.840]   before the beginning of time, the plan that was made before the foundation of the world
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.240]   and to our glory, this time that was known to God and that our hour had struck, and he
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:04.560]   sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, born of a virgin.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.160]   Truly men, and yet God has to be men to be under the law in order that he might redeem
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.600]   those that are under the law.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:20.360]   Time here to me is one of the most consoling and wonderful things about Christmas.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.680]   The fullness of time, God's time, what does it tell us?
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.440]   Well it tells us this, you see, and this is the great hope that should be in every one
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:36.120]   of our hearts this morning, that God is independent of this world and of what happens in it.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.680]   I've reminded you hurriedly of the story of the great civilizations I might have thrown
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.840]   in, the civilization of China and the civilization of Egypt, on top of what I've said, these
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.480]   great civilizations and the world is interested in them, but you know they're more or less
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:59.280]   irrelevant and thank God, God is utterly independent of them.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.040]   He acts quite apart from them.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:09.960]   He permits them, I say, for his own purpose, to show their final uselessness and futility,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:17.120]   and then he acts at his own appointed hour, at his own appointed moment, when he feels
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.360]   that the conditions are such that this can be done, he does it.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:29.280]   The exact moment, at the exact place, everything as it had been prophesied and predicted.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.680]   Or you can look at it if you like in this way.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:41.840]   The birth of that babe in Bethlehem is the proof of the supremacy of God.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:48.120]   The world can't save itself, but it can't prevent God from saving it either.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.840]   He acts independently of it, cuts across its schemes, its plans, its programs, and all
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.960]   that it can think of and devise.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.880]   The world was against this babe when he was born.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   Read your Gospels again, look at a king like Herod, look at all of them.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.680]   They were against him, and it's been against him ever since.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.160]   God is before time, he's above time, he's independent of time, and he can break into
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.320]   it in spite of the opposition of the world and all its peoples.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.560]   The birth of the babe at Bethlehem tells us that this morning.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.040]   Right in time, behold him come.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:34.880]   Yes, but at the exact moment when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.920]   son made of a woman made under the law.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.480]   And you see, the next thing is this, his coming is the center of time.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.040]   When I mean the center, I don't mean the exact number of years.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   I'm not suggesting that there will be 4,000 years after his birth before the end of the
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440]   world.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.280]   I think there's a great deal to be said rather for 2,000 years after his birth.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.400]   That doesn't matter.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.960]   We don't know about that.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   But what I do know is this, that his coming in the fullness of the times has made him
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.240]   the center of time.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:13.320]   And all this is something in which as Christian people we should rejoice this morning.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:19.600]   This babe was born and the world took no notice, paid no attention, no room in the inn.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.920]   They were aware of the great people who booked the best rooms in the inns of Bethlehem.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:30.320]   They knew nothing about this poor woman who had to go to the stable to give birth to her
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   child.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.960]   They knew still less about the babe and so he's got to be put into a manger.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.120]   There was no crib for him.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.920]   The world doesn't know.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.800]   It doesn't understand.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.160]   It thinks this is insignificant and unimportant.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.360]   Like certain clever modern people probably regarded him as an illegitimate child.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.440]   That's the kind of blasphemy that is being uttered in the name of Christianity by certain
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   people today.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.880]   But that you see is just ignorance and darkness and blindness.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:09.640]   Here is a babe born who has come from the beyond, outside time, into time, and his influence
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.280]   upon time is to change everything.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.840]   He's the end of an age.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.400]   He's the beginning of another.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.640]   Your Old Testament looks up to this.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.600]   Your New Testament looks back at this.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   He divides.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   You'll find this.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.920]   You can't understand your New Testament if you're not clear about this point.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.640]   At the end of the age we are told that these last times, in these last days, you see that
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.960]   is what he's done.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   He's ended an era, an epoch.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.160]   He's started a new one.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.800]   Old Testament, New Testament, the old dispensation, new dispensation.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.760]   God put it in more ordinary terms.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.440]   Ever since this child came into the world, your ordinary calendars have to be changed.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.920]   Everybody now talks about BC, AD.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.400]   He's the turning point.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.200]   BC, before Christ, that's your history, that's your chronology.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.480]   He's come.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.760]   Years of the Lord, Anno Domini, after Christ.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.680]   Here is one, you see, who coming into time, divides it.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   Is the center.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.560]   He's a kind of fulcrum.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.040]   Everything turns around him and nothing is ever the same again, even time itself.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:37.160]   And for me to conclude, we can't leave this matter without reminding you of this.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.280]   He came from the eternity into time.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   He spent a number of years.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:51.080]   Here in this world, subject to time and subject to all the things to which you and I are subject.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:57.280]   And then he went back again into the glory and into the eternity.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.000]   Does that mean that he's finished with time?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.200]   No, it doesn't.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.320]   He is still concerned about time.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:14.640]   And what I mean is this, you see, you can't think of that coming of the babe of Bethlehem
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.880]   without thinking of who he was.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:23.640]   And you can't think of who he was and what he's already done when he was in this world
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   without thinking of him now.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.000]   And there you see him seated at the right hand of God in the glory, everlasting.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   What's he doing?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.360]   Well, we are told by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews that he is sitting and waiting
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.320]   until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:50.800]   And that means this, that that selfsame Jesus will again come.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   He will again enter into this world.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.160]   He will again break into time.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   What will be his relationship to time then?
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.240]   Oh, he will come then to end time.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.760]   And time shall be no more.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:19.040]   He's going to wind up time, finish it, bring an end to the universe as we know it.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.160]   And then he will reign from pearl to pearl.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.880]   And all in earth and heaven and under the sea and everywhere will bow the knee to him
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:39.440]   and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:47.520]   You see, this is how Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 15, "Then cometh the end."
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:55.160]   And the end comes when he comes again into this world and judges it in righteousness,
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:03.120]   gathers those who rejoice in the babe of Bethlehem, in the man Christ Jesus, especially the Christ
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.680]   of the crucifixion, the cross dying to bear the punishment of our sins, the buried Christ,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.840]   the risen Christ, the ascended Christ, the reigning, ruling Christ, all who rejoice in
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.360]   this blessed person, he will gather to himself.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:27.400]   And they will reign with him and enjoy his glory forever and forever and forever beyond
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.160]   time in the eternity everlasting.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:43.600]   He will end time and hand back to God the Father a universe purged of sin and evil and
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.480]   rebellion and wrong and ugliness and all that is foul.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:59.080]   He will hand back to his Father a restored, a regenerated, a perfect universe peopled
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.640]   with his own perfect people.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:10.240]   Thank God this isn't a philosophy, this isn't a psychological teaching, this is not
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:15.960]   just something telling us to be better, it is telling us what God has done to redeem
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:24.680]   us and not merely to make us better but to make us sons of God and heirs of that eternal
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.480]   glory which is to come.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:34.960]   The Son of God, as John Calvin put it, became the Son of Man that the sinful sons of men
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.760]   might be made the sons of God.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:50.640]   And you and I shall be taken out of this time relationship into the eternal glory.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:57.600]   Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.840]   Amen.
