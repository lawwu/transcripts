[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.720]   All right, so we have a question here from Erica.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.420]   Erica asks, why do you think there is a lot of attention and
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.240]   hype on the FIRE movement, but not as much attention on other
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.920]   career options such as part time or contract work?
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840]   You know, Erica, it's an interesting question.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.240]   There has been a lot of attention on the FIRE community.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.120]   There was, I think, a moment maybe a few years ago where this reached a peak.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.440]   I think it's kind of dying back down again.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.640]   And I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.440]   But for the listener who doesn't know what we're talking about,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.920]   FIRE stands for Financial Independence Retire Early.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's a movement mainly of sort of middle class,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.080]   highly educated knowledge workers, so salaried knowledge workers.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   Where the whole notion is, if you have a good salary,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.520]   like you're a computer programmer, and you bring your expenses,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.280]   you get very comfortable living cheaply.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.800]   You get this double edged advantage where, A, you can save a lot of money,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.240]   because you're only living on a little bit of money you earn.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.080]   And B, because you live cheaply, the amount of money you have to save
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.960]   to then sustain your lifestyle just off of savings,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.160]   the formal definition of financial independence, becomes much lower.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.480]   And basically, if you do this math, if you can live on,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.560]   these numbers aren't precise, but it's roughly speaking,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   if you can live on 20% of what you make,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.360]   then 10 years of savings, more or less,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.800]   will be enough to in perpetuity cover that 20%,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.400]   and you'll be financially independent.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.600]   All right, so that's the FIRE movement.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.760]   Mr. Money Mustache is a big player in that movement.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520]   I wrote about him in Digital Minimalism.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.240]   He actually blurbed Digital Minimalism.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.520]   Nate and Liz Thames, the Frugalwoods,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   they have a really interesting blog.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.920]   I talked about them in a recent New Yorker piece of mine,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   and they're interesting examples of FIRE proponents.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.680]   And there's a bunch of others.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.840]   This is why I think a lot of attention goes to movements like FIRE,
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.200]   is extreme examples are a useful way to illustrate powerful,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.640]   but much more generally applicable principles.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.840]   This is something that advice writers know.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.880]   You give the big example that's out there
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.360]   because it purifies and clarifies what the underlying mechanism is,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.200]   and it purifies and clarifies the aspirational appeal of that mechanism.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.840]   It's the best way to make the more general point.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.640]   So the more general point that's being made by the FIRE movement
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   is that you have way more flexibility than the culture makes clear
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.360]   to play around with this income expense equation.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.480]   There's this cultural pressure that, you know,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.000]   you get moved to whatever city that you get pushed into
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.520]   because that's where the job is.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.840]   And then once you're there, you take your salary
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.600]   and you basically spend most of it.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.320]   And if you're really on the ball,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.040]   you can save 15% in your 401k,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   and that plus social security might take care of you when you're 65.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.520]   And along the way, when you're about to get married or buy a car,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.200]   try to put a little bit more money aside.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040]   And the underlying principle that the FIRE movement points out
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   is you have way more control over that than you think.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.880]   You don't have to just live at whatever amount of money you happen to make.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.400]   You have to live just right there.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120]   That doesn't give you the return you think it does.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.640]   Are you really way more happier when you're 35
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.400]   than when you were when you were 22?
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.600]   You make a lot more money at 35.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.120]   You've probably increased your spending to match that money,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.320]   but, you know, you lived on a lot less money when you were 22.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.760]   Were you miserable? Probably not.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680]   These are the type of questions they push.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.760]   What if you had stayed at that level of spending you had
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.440]   when you were 22 now that you're 35?
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   Think about all the flexibility you would have with your money.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.880]   What about if you move somewhere cheaper?
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.920]   So this was the big point I made in my recent New Yorker article
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.440]   about the great cubicle escape.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.000]   I talked about Bill McKibben and his wife, Sue Halperin,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.800]   how they moved to the Adirondacks.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.360]   He quit the New Yorker, they moved to the Adirondacks
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.080]   in part because it was incredibly cheap to live there.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.880]   And because it was so cheap to live there,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.400]   Sue and Bill could just do freelance articles
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.600]   at their own leisure and live quite comfortably.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.800]   And then when Bill had a hit book with The End of Nature,
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.400]   he said, "This is great.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   Instead of trying to go ride this wave
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.680]   and make as much money as possible,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.800]   this will buy me the ability to basically
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.400]   sell any book to a publisher that I want to write
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.000]   and I'll get a reasonable advance on it."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040]   And because we live cheaply,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.960]   if I just write a book every two or three years
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.080]   on whatever I want to write about,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.440]   that'll kind of cover all of our expenses.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.120]   I don't even have to do the freelancing anymore.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.280]   They hacked the equation.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.040]   Let's bring down the expenses.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.840]   Now we can get by with a lot less money.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.880]   That is the general point.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.080]   I think that is the appeal.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.920]   So, Erica, when you talk about career options
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.440]   such as part-time or contract work,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.240]   this is actually where you get to.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.800]   Most people, once they're exposed to fire,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.640]   is thinking, "I'm going to sell the 3,000 square foot house.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.960]   I'm going to move over to the Eastern Shore.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.120]   I'm leaving Fairfax to go to Chestertown
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.400]   or something like this.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.760]   And I'm going to buy a house
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.920]   that's a fraction of the price.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.640]   And I'm going to live on half the money.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.320]   And I'm going to do contract work.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.560]   And I'm going to take three months out of the 12 off every year
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.160]   or work three days a week."
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   That type of engineering and flexibility
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   that you can have more options than you think
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.040]   to contrive what your work life works like.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.880]   You have a lot of flexibility on your expenses.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   You have a lot of flexibility on how you want to earn.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.920]   And getting out there and actually exploring those options,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.280]   that is the lesson of fire.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.920]   Not this idea that you have to fully be financially independent
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.080]   and living on this incredibly small amount of money
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.600]   and it's all coming out of your savings
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.960]   and all of that nonsense.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.320]   That is all a distraction.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   That's not why fire is popular.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.680]   It's not that people want to live on $18,000 a year in a trailer
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.920]   because they could technically be financially independent
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.960]   by the age of 27.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.200]   It's that they want to take back control and say,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.840]   "I have way more options to engineer my life
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.200]   than the culture is telling me."
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.240]   So, Erica, you're right to say fire seems a little bit extreme,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   but that extremeness, I think, is why it's appealing.
