[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060]   As you can tell from your bulletin, and if you've been here the last couple of weeks,
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.940]   we're doing a brief series looking at the church under the title Heaven on Earth.
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.780]   That is what the church is in the world.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.680]   It should bring down heaven.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.320]   A church should be nothing like the world, and it should approximate heaven.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.840]   Churches, however, today seem to have lost their sense of heavenly connection.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.060]   They have an identity crisis in so many churches, shifting styles, changing methods,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.060]   shallow sentimentalism, naive theology, superficial worship, all kinds of things.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.640]   It's a smorgasbord of attempts to, quote-unquote, make the church relevant
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.540]   to a fast-changing world.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.160]   This calls for us to go back to the foundations, and that's what we're endeavoring to do in this series.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.820]   The right way to define the church in its true form is this.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.560]   It is the present form of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.140]   It is the present form of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.620]   That is a fundamental definition of the church.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.600]   The kingdom has many manifestations.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.120]   There is the universal kingdom, the kingdom of creation over which God is the universal
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.620]   sovereign.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.340]   He rules over all creation.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.000]   There is the eternal kingdom to come, the new heaven and the new earth.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.880]   Again, this will be the kingdom of righteousness and holiness.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.940]   That last word is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.440]   That lasts forever.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.100]   There is the millennial kingdom, which is a thousand-year reign of Christ on earth,
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.940]   when He comes and sets up His throne in Jerusalem and rules over the entire world.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.200]   The kingdom has various manifestations through redemptive history, but for now, in this present
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.220]   era, it is the present form of the kingdom of heaven, and that is the church.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.260]   The church.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:37.080]   It should be informed by and conformed to heavenly realities.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.720]   As Paul said to the Colossians, "It should be where our affections lie."
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.560]   As Jesus said, "It should be where our treasure is."
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.460]   Our perspective has to be heavenly.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.260]   The church is the realm of the redeemed.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   . . .
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.260]   The kingdom ruled over by God and His appointed head, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.020]   As we saw a couple of weeks ago, Paul said that if you're a believer, you've been transferred
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.260]   from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.920]   There's a lot of kingdom language in the gospels as our Lord speaks of His kingdom and entrance
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.760]   into His kingdom and those who will not enter into His heavenly kingdom, and this is familiar
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.260]   language to any Bible study.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540]   And it is the way to understand the church.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.100]   It is the kingdom of heaven on earth.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:44.880]   In 1 Corinthians 15:23 it says, "The church is the kingdom made up of those who are Christ's."
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.560]   That's a great statement.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.260]   The true church, the kingdom of heaven on earth, is made up of those who are Christ's.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.260]   It's a great statement.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.260]   It's a great statement.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.480]   Now when you understand that, it ends all the foolishness of trying to figure out what
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.340]   a church is and should be.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.960]   What establishes the entire ministry of the church, what establishes everything about
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.260]   the church, is what the King says about His kingdom.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.260]   Our King is none other than the King of kings and Lord of lords, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.440]   the Father made Him as head over the church.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.500]   The church of Jesus Christ, then, is not a man-made organization.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.800]   It is not a human institution.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.500]   It is not to be designed by clever people, or any people for that matter.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.640]   It is certainly not to be designed to fit the preferences of a debauched culture or
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.260]   the desires of the unconverted.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:00.920]   The church is heaven on earth, and if that is the case, then there is an obvious reality
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.100]   that is the very foundation in the church, and it is this: that we are conformed to the
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.540]   will of God in heaven.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.920]   That's why 1 Timothy 3:15 says, "The church is the pillar and support of the truth."
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.500]   When we say that, we're really talking about the truth.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   We're talking about the truth.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.120]   We're really talking about the true foundation of the church.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.360]   It is built on truth.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:41.040]   And as we saw in Psalm 119, it is built on truth, designated as the Word of God, fixed,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.900]   settled in heaven forever.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.800]   It doesn't change.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.740]   Now the last couple of weeks, we talked about some things.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.820]   We talked about some other foundational doctrines regarding the church, the church and election,
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.360]   or the kingdom and sovereignty.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   It is the work of God and Christ, Christ said, "I will build My church."
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.240]   We talked about the church and identification, or the kingdom and substitution.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.740]   It is in union with Christ, who is our substitute and Savior.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   And we talked about the church and purification.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.440]   The church and sanctification.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.280]   The church and the election, we looked at the Father's role in choosing the church before
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.980]   the foundation of the world.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.960]   In the church and identification, we looked at the role of Christ, who is in union with
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   the church.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:48.620]   Substitution and imputation being that marvelous defining language that speaks of us being
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.740]   in Christ and Him in us.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.740]   Amen?
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.180]   And then thirdly, we looked at the church and purification, which points directly to
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.720]   the work of the Holy Spirit in sanctification.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.900]   So we've been looking at these first three foundations and seeing essentially that there
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.900]   is a Trinitarian character to them.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.980]   Now this brings us to the fourth in our five doctrines.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.280]   We'll save the fifth one for next time.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.920]   The church and revelation.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.980]   The church and revelation, meaning the Word of God.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.500]   Or the kingdom and Scripture.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.980]   The kingdom and Scripture.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:32.860]   This is really the very foundation of all three that we have spoken about, because the
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.720]   reason we understand the doctrine of election and identification and substitution and sanctification
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.260]   is because we understand the Scripture.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.900]   This is the cornerstone of what the church is.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.900]   Then one reality.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   And we can narrow this down.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.900]   We can narrow this down.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.940]   We can narrow this down to one, which is very helpful for us.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.980]   One reality guarantees that the church will be heaven on earth.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.980]   One reality.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.660]   And that is that it is conformed to the Scripture.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:11.280]   Again, I remind you of Psalm 119:89, that verse that I read earlier.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:18.020]   "Forever, O Lord, Your Word is settled in heaven."
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020]   It's not changing.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.120]   God doesn't change.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.400]   His Word doesn't change.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:35.980]   In fact, in Psalm 119:160 says, "The entirety of Your Word is truth, and all endures forever."
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.700]   In the words of Isaiah 40 and verse 8, "The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.100]   Word of our God stands forever."
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.020]   That's why going back to Psalm 119:89, "The Word of our God stands forever."
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.020]   That's why going back to Psalm 119:89, "The Word of our God stands forever."
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   That's why going back to Psalm 119:89, "The Word of our God stands forever."
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   Verse 89, "The Word of our God stands forever."
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.100]   Verse 99 says, "Forever, O Lord, Your Word is settled in heaven."
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:59.260]   And then verse 90 follows it up immediately by saying, "And it demonstrates God's faithfulness
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:05.860]   to all generations, for all generations in all of human history, the Word of God is settled
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:13.020]   – settled, established, fixed, set in heaven."
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020]   1 Peter 1:25 says, "The Word of the Lord endures forever."
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.020]   1 Peter 1:25 says, "The Word of the Lord endures forever."
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:27.240]   Jesus said, "Not one jot or tittle from My Word shall in any wise pass away until all
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   is fulfilled."
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   Matthew 5.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.620]   And in Matthew 24, He said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Word will never pass
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.780]   away."
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.620]   The Word of God is eternal, never altered, never changed.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.400]   Nothing can be added to it.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.020]   Nothing can be taken from it, and that is the final warning in the Bible at the end
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.700]   of the book of Revelation.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.400]   If you add anything or take anything away from this, you'll be added to the plagues
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.720]   that are written in this book.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.920]   This is the Word of God settled forever in heaven.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.100]   So for us to understand how the church is to behave as heaven on earth simply is to
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:15.240]   bring the truth of God settled in heaven to earth and live according to it.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:23.720]   We conform our lives to the Scripture, to the Word of God.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.460]   And that becomes the theme of the instruction in two critical books in the New Testament
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.720]   I want you to look at with me, 1 and 2 Timothy.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.600]   These are called the Pastoral Epistles because this is the Spirit of God through the apostle
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.120]   Paul showing Timothy what is required.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120]   1 Timothy 2:1-2.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   "And the Spirit of God is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of God."
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   1 Timothy 2:1-2.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   "And the Spirit of God is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of God."
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.420]   This is the spirit required of pastors who lead the church.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.020]   And you will see clearly the emphasis.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:03.420]   If you look at 1 Timothy 3:15, I already quoted it, "The church is the church of the living
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.160]   God, the pillar and support of the truth."
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   What truth?
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:15.000]   The truth settled in heaven and revealed on the pages of Holy Scripture.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.180]   And that brings you into chapter 4.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.280]   And we read at the very outset, "The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits, doctrines of demons,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:38.760]   hypocritical liars, seared in their conscience, who go against the Scriptures."
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   That's the implication.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.880]   Verse 5 says, "Everything is sanctified by means of the Word of God."
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.880]   And prayer.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   The Word of God is everything.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:56.400]   And so Paul says to Timothy, if you want to be a faithful pastor, listen to this: "You
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:06.060]   will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.500]   the sound doctrine which you have been following."
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   That's the positive.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.760]   The negative is in verse 7.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   The good is in verse 7.

[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   "And have nothing to do with worldly things."
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   The good is in verse 7.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:43.820]   The power is in the Word.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:55.320]   One final passage on this particular point, 1 Peter 1, verse 24 - or verse 23, rather:
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.060]   "For you have been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.740]   is, through the living and enduring Word of God."
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.360]   And this is the Word that was preached to you.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:22.600]   He preached the Word, and the Word, the living and enduring Word of God, gave life.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.880]   The Word of God is alive.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.860]   He gives life to all who believe.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.960]   Consequently, preach the Word.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.720]   Why would you do anything else?
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.220]   Nothing else can give life.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.620]   Nothing else.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:52.780]   Notice down in verse 16 that it not only produces salvation, but it establishes doctrine.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:32:01.160]   It is profitable for teaching, or for doctrine, didaskalion.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.700]   That's not a process teaching, that's a content.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.640]   It's not a process teaching, that's a content.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.540]   It's not a process teaching, that's a content.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   The Word is the body of truth.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.740]   Scripture is the body of truth revealed that Paul gave to Timothy, and Timothy was to guard,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.940]   as we saw in 1 Timothy 6 and 2 Timothy 1.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.940]   It is the truth.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.260]   Your Word is truth.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.020]   God's will is revealed in His Word.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:35.680]   The Word is filled with teaching that generates truths, propositional truth, fixed truth.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.120]   Eternal truth.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.960]   Everlasting truth.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   Unchanging truth.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:53.800]   And that is what we as pastors would want, I would hope, to dispense to our congregation.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.000]   If you want to give them anything, you want to give them the truth.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.720]   Why would you give them anything else?
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.660]   Listen to an interesting comment in Matthew 24.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.920]   Matthew 24:22-16.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.380]   The Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus, and they sent their disciples to Him along with
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:19.960]   the Herodians, and they asked this question in verse 16, or they made this comment: "Teacher,
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:27.880]   we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   for you are not partial to any."
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.640]   Now just how much flattery that was.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.820]   Outside of that "I don't know," it is still absolutely a true statement.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.140]   You, the teacher, are truthful.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.900]   You teach the way of God in truth.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.300]   You defer to no one.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.480]   You are not partial to any.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.880]   You never, ever deviate from the truth.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.700]   Never, ever.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.620]   Later in verse 29, Jesus said to them, "You are not partial to any.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   You are not part of the truth."
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.440]   You're confused and mistaken because you don't understand the Scriptures.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.320]   And because you don't understand the Scriptures, you don't understand the power of God.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:23.120]   The power of God is released through Scripture only when it is rightly divided and when you
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.120]   believe.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:33.800]   The knowledge of God's Word forms our entire theology, our entire view of everything in
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.600]   the natural and the supernatural world.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:43.200]   That's why the Bible says over and over again, "Be renewed in your mind," Romans 12.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.100]   Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, Ephesians 4.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:53.260]   Philippians, I pray that you'll have real knowledge and discernment.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:35:01.920]   The power of the Word unleashed in your life when accurately understood is the power that
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.580]   establishes a set of convictions by which you can be truly convinced.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.460]   You can live your life to your own blessing and to the glory of God.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:21.880]   Thirdly, he says, "This Scripture is profitable not only for salvation and for doctrine, but
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.760]   for reproof."
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.000]   Strong word.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.940]   It refutes.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.420]   It confutes.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.660]   It convinces.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.080]   It convicts.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   It rebukes.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.560]   This is the other side of truth teaching.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.240]   It exposes error.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.800]   When you have an expository ministry and you preach the Word of God, you are bound to make
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.760]   some people uncomfortable.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.060]   Some months ago, I was on some interview, and somebody said to me in that interview,
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.860]   "Does it bother you that you offend people?"
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:58.980]   I said, "No, I live to offend people," because that's the work of the Word.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.940]   It exposes their error.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.540]   It undoes everything that is deceitful.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.760]   It is deceptive.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.960]   It unmasks all the lies.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:16.420]   It crushes the fortified ideologies that condemn people.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:22.360]   So we preach the Word because it saves.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:32.420]   It establishes truth, structure which produces convictions, and it reproves us in our error
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.080]   and our sin.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.520]   And there's more.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.940]   It also corrects us.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.020]   So at first, it makes you feel badly, but only with the purpose of establishing the
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.100]   right thing to do and believe.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.800]   It reproves error.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.380]   It reproves unrighteousness.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:37:01.080]   And that's Hebrews 4, which is also an amazing testimony to the power of Scripture.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.640]   Listen to Hebrews 4:12.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.500]   The Word of God is living and active.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:11.980]   sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.060]   of joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart, and
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.320]   nobody can hide from it."
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:26.980]   The Scripture will cut right to the bone, right to your soul, your spirit.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   That's how powerful it is.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   It is effective.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   It is dynamic.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.280]   It is accurate.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:40.040]   It penetrates into the inmost recesses of the spiritual heart, into the depths of sin.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040]   It sifts.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.040]   It analyzes.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:50.200]   It reveals emotions, attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, and God misses nothing with
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.360]   His Word and no one.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.620]   Men hate that.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.100]   John 3: "They hate the light because their deeds are" - what?
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.200]   - "are evil, but it's a necessary exercise."
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:10.960]   So the Word of God does all that work, rebuking error, confronting sin.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.720]   And then comes correction in verse 16.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.880]   Correction.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.560]   To straighten up.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.720]   To thoroughly restore to an upright position.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:30.820]   It'll break you down, and then it'll put you back together in a far better condition.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:37.720]   In John 15, our Lord talked about this same work of the Word.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   In verse 3, He said, "I will not be a slave to the Lord, but I will be a slave to the
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   Lord."
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:50.520]   You are already clean because of the Word which I have spoken to you.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:56.940]   The Word of God not only exposes your sin, it cleans you up.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.500]   It corrects you.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:07.240]   Another passage that speaks of this is Ephesians 5:26, "Regarding the church, the Lord's desire
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.640]   is that He would sanctify the church.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.220]   Cleansing her by the washing of water with the Word."
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.500]   How are we cleansed?
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   How are we rebuked?
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.640]   But then how are we corrected?
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.160]   By the work of the Word.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:28.380]   Washing with the water of the Word, so that He can present to Himself a church in all
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:33.280]   her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.440]   blameless.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.560]   The Word does the rebuking, and the Word does the correcting.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   And then, verse 17.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.400]   "He who is holy, he is a righteous man."
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.020]   This is the full work of the Word.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:56.600]   It tears you down, it rebuilds you, and then it trains you in the right direction.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:03.560]   As you feed on the Word of God, Peter says in 1 Peter 2:2, "Like newborn babes, long
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:09.840]   for the pure milk of the Word, so that you may grow in respect to salvation."
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.480]   The Word begins with the Word.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.180]   It begins by assaulting you and offending you, and then it sets the correction in place,
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.780]   and then it begins to train you in righteousness.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.160]   So why is it that every time you come here, we're teaching you the Bible?
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.680]   This is why.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.580]   We only have one tool.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.260]   We only have one tool.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:40.400]   Since the Word does all that, verse 17, "It accomplishes its purpose."
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.180]   Because it's objective.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:49.720]   The man of God, by the work of the Word, in saving, and teaching, and reproving, and correcting,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:41:00.220]   and training, makes the man of God adequate, perfect, complete, mature, equipped for every
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   good work.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.980]   What more could you be than equipped for every good work?
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.300]   That's the max, right?
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.320]   So what is going to get you to that kind of spiritual maturity?
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:18.180]   Where you are artios, is the Greek word, where you are complete, capable, proficient.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.680]   It's the Word of God.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.420]   The Word of God, that's the tool.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.780]   It's always been the tool.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.540]   And so faithful pastors go deep into the Word to mine out its riches.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.380]   They disdain the flat, trivial, shallow preaching.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.240]   They reject the formulas.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.940]   The cleverness, the human wisdom.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.420]   They know the Word is the truth that transforms.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:53.640]   And so a faithful pastor takes his people consistently down deep into the Word, because
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:03.480]   that's the demand, and the singular demand from God for His ministry.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:08.780]   When you don't do that, you get a kind of evangelicalism that is man-centered, trying
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.160]   to make people feel good about themselves.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:17.380]   Rather than encountering the realities of heaven.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:23.540]   Just to kind of wrap up, I want to go back to the Reformation and give you a couple of
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.540]   illustrations.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.280]   The greatest revival the church ever knew, in my judgment, was the Reformation back in
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.980]   the 16th century.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:38.780]   And the Reformation really came about because there was a restoration of biblical expository
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.080]   preaching.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:48.740]   Take, for example, John Calvin, whose impact was probably without parallel.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.420]   He was relentless in his exposition of Scripture.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:43:01.740]   In Geneva, he started in 1536, and he exposited the Scripture until 1564 with a three-year
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.200]   break when he was exiled by the city council.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.000]   But it wasn't just Calvin.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   R.L.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.120]   Calvin says, "All the leading Reformers, whether in Germany, Switzerland, England,
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:22.660]   or Scotland, were constant preachers, and their sermons were expository.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:30.300]   We may assume with safety that the instrumentality to which the Spirit unleashed power in that
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.800]   greatest of all revolutions was the restoration of scriptural preaching."
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.920]   That was the Reformation.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   It came because of that.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.040]   The Bible forms the whole content of our preaching.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:54.720]   And, by the way, God set forth all its truths in such contexts and proportions and relations
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.000]   as He knows suit the soul of man under the work of the Holy Spirit so that you don't
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.980]   need to alter the Scripture.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:09.480]   This is the way God wanted it.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:09.840]   What is preaching?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.260]   It is preaching, then.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:18.740]   It is explaining the Scripture in its context, and the church, if it will be heaven on earth,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:24.640]   must be radically committed to Scripture.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.360]   Part of the problem of the confusion in the church, probably most of it, resides with
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:37.460]   those preachers who refuse to do this, maybe out of pride, maybe out of unbelief, maybe
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.760]   out of laziness.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.420]   Maybe out of sin.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.620]   They don't do what we must do.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.380]   They will be held in account.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:56.580]   James 3:1, "Stop being so many teachers; theirs is a greater judgment."
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:01.680]   But the Reformers understood it.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.980]   Take for example Calvin.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.140]   He wrote tracts.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.680]   He wrote massive theologians.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.700]   He wrote theologians, the institutes.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.720]   He wrote commentaries on Scripture, except the book of Revelation.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.860]   He gave lectures.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.220]   He regularly preached ten sermons every two weeks.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.980]   That's a lot of work.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.360]   All of them Scripture exposition.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:38.380]   And then Luther, between 1510 and 1546, that's 36 years, he preached 3,000 sermons, frequently,
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.600]   many days a week.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:47.620]   Sometimes more than two times a day, studying, preparing, and preaching.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:54.920]   He did all that, as did John Calvin, with some very serious issues in their home life,
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.520]   with their wives and children who were ill and died.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.600]   Luther preached to his children on Sunday afternoons.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.560]   Here's just a little bit of insight into Luther.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.520]   In 1520, he wrote 130 sermons.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.180]   He wrote 130 works on Scripture.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.640]   In 1522, he wrote 130 works.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:24.120]   In 1523, he wrote 183 works, one every other day.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.200]   Here's a Sunday with Luther at Wittenberg.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.760]   Five a.m., he exposited an epistle.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.580]   Ten a.m., a gospel.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.480]   Five p.m., a book of the Old Testament.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.440]   Monday and Tuesday, he taught theology and the catechism.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.680]   Sunday he preached on Matthew.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.040]   Thursday and Friday on Apostolic Letters.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.340]   Saturday on John.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:49.140]   And he did that all week, week after week.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:57.340]   The whole church was just preaching, preaching, hearing the truth of God's Word.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.760]   John Calvin did the same thing.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.780]   It's really astonishing.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.560]   Preaching in the same church in Geneva, the cathedral there where I've had the privilege
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.360]   of preaching, an amazing opportunity, just to give you some idea.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.980]   The first thing I want to talk about is the scope of Calvin.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:20.600]   In August of 1549, he began a series on Acts and ended it in March of 1554, five years
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.180]   later.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.800]   After that, he decided to preach on the Thessalonian epistles and preached 46 sermons.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.440]   Then he preached 186 sermons on Corinthians.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.980]   Then he preached 86 on the pastoral epistles.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.280]   Then he preached 43 on Galatians.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.040]   Then he preached 44 on Ephesians.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   Then there was a gap while he was ill in 1558.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:53.660]   But he came back in 1559 and began the harmony of the gospels and didn't finish when he died
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:58.260]   in May of 1564.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:04.140]   On the weekdays during that same season, he preached 159 sermons on Job, 200 sermons on
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.100]   Deuteronomy, 353 on Isaiah, 123 on Genesis, and on Isaiah.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   He preached 159 sermons on the Gospel of the Lord.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.100]   He preached 159 sermons on the Gospel of the Lord.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   He preached 159 sermons on the Gospel of the Lord.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.100]   He preached 159 sermons on the Gospel of the Lord.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:18.940]   on and on, just this saturation of Scripture. It was an Easter day in 1538. He preached
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:25.420]   in the cathedral, and the city council arrested him and banished him. He returned three years
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:36.960]   later and picked up the exposition in the next verse.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.120]   Calvin believed the Word of God was the lamp that had been taken away from the church. Calvin
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:49.900]   had a horror of those who preached their own ideas in the pulpit. He knew the Word of God
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:59.780]   was indeed the power that was profitable. I'll give you just a quote to close in sermon
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:06.780]   number 61 on Deuteronomy. He said this: "Let the pastors boldly dare all things by the
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:06.780]   Word of God, and let them know that the Word of God is the power of the church." He said
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:06.880]   this: "Let the pastors boldly dare all things by the Word of God, and let them know that
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:06.940]   the Word of God is the power of the church." He said this: "Let the pastors boldly dare all
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.940]   Word of God.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.940]   Let them constrain all the power, glory, and excellence of the world to give place to and
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:18.460]   to obey the divine majesty of this Word.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.120]   Let them enjoin everyone by it from the highest to the lowest.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.660]   Let them edify the body of Christ.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.260]   Let them devastate Satan's reign.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.340]   Let them pasture the sheep, kill the wolves, instruct and exhort the rebellious.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:35.920]   Let them bind and loose thunder and lightning if necessary.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:43.380]   Let them do all of it according to the Word of God.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:50.260]   It's heaven on earth when the Word of God reigns in the church.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.160]   Let's pray.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:02.960]   Lord, certainly in our hearts we're here in this church because we understand the power
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.720]   of Your Word.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.920]   Let us pray.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.900]   Lord, we hope this morning You have driven that even deeper into our hearts and sealed
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.100]   it permanently.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:26.340]   May we understand that this is the church's one great calling to unleash Your Word, to
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:29.920]   do its work, to accomplish everything.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   All things pertaining to life and godliness are found in the Word.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:44.100]   May we be brought to the hearts and souls of men and women when that Word is preached.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:48.100]   Lord, I pray that You would raise up more preachers.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:54.460]   We know that if there's ever to be another Reformation, ever to be a great revival across
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:51:00.100]   this country, it will happen only when pulpits proclaim Your Word and nothing else.
