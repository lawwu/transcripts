[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.600]   Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.760]   at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.900]   It was entitled The Brain-Body Contract.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.920]   The first part of the evening was a lecture
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.680]   about science and science-based tools
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.340]   The second half was a question and answer period
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.000]   in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.760]   or related to their own interests
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.040]   or things that they've gleaned from social media,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.820]   or just general questions about mental health,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.540]   And I answered those questions for them.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.080]   We wanted to make the recorded version
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.020]   of that question and answer session available to everybody,
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.740]   regardless of who could attend.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.320]   So what follows is the question and answer period
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.840]   from the Wiltern Theater Brain-Body Contract
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960]   live Huberman Lab event.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.480]   Want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.400]   They were 8 Sleep, which makes smart mattress covers
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.680]   with heating and cooling capacity.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.560]   I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.720]   about eight months ago,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.040]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.900]   I sleep so much deeper.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.920]   I wake up far less during the middle of the night,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.360]   if at all, and I wake up feeling far better
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.100]   In fact, I love my 8 Sleep so much that when I travel,
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000]   now I'm quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.040]   don't have 8 Sleep mattress covers on them.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.500]   And I've even shipped my 8 Sleep mattress cover out
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.700]   to meet me in the location that I arrived to
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.860]   so that I get the best possible sleep.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.700]   If you want to try 8 Sleep,
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.960]   to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday bundle,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.320]   which includes their new Pod 3 cover.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.600]   8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom,
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.220]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.820]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.920]   I'd like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentus.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.040]   They make the very highest quality supplements.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.780]   They ship internationally.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.000]   And they've formulated supplements
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120]   as single ingredient formulations
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   If you're interested in any of those supplements,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.580]   please go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.720]   And now without further ado, the question and answer period
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640]   from the Huberman Lab live event in Los Angeles.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.220]   [upbeat music]
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.460]   What occurs in the mind body when you have ADHD?
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.040]   Are there ways to address it without medication?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.480]   Thank you for this question.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.700]   So attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.260]   used to be called ADD.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.240]   The hyperactivity part is a little misleading.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.540]   And again, I'm not a clinician here.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.700]   Here's what we know works for some people.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.580]   And yet there are always going to be side effects
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.740]   of any kind of chemical manipulation,
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.400]   which is that we know that people, kids and adults
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.140]   with ADHD actually have a tremendous capacity to focus
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.020]   if they like what they're focusing on.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.180]   You take a kid with ADHD who can't focus
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.700]   and you give them their favorite video game
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.580]   and they are a laser.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.460]   The threshold to access the dopamine system is higher.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.820]   And dopamine has this incredible ability
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.640]   to focus the brain and other aspects of the nervous system.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.260]   Certainly if people require medication,
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.660]   I'm not going to tell you to stop taking that medication.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.300]   But the focus training exercises
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.040]   that have been explored mainly in China,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.140]   but they're starting to be explored over here as well,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.820]   do seem to be of benefit.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.340]   And these are, as they sound,
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.120]   they use them in schools in China now,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.440]   which are literally visual focus exercises.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.120]   Your mental focus, that is your ability
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.060]   to focus on things cognitively, follows your visual focus.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.220]   And of course, your stress will anchor your,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.660]   essentially put you in a soda straw view of the world.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.980]   So yes, there are non-medication based treatments.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.420]   By medication, I'm assuming you mean
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.900]   prescription medication.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.260]   There are of course, supplement based medications
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.540]   that will increase dopamine, mainly L-tyrosine.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.380]   Again, this is something to think carefully about
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.340]   before you start tampering with your dopamine system.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.980]   But it is the, L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.480]   So it will raise your dopamine levels.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.540]   But I believe, and you'll hear me say this
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.280]   as many times as necessary, that one should,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.600]   if you can, rely on behavioral tools first.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Then of course, sleep and nutrition are prerequisite.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.640]   Again, for all mental health, physical health performance,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.820]   you simply can't neglect those.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.900]   And then, and only then, if those,
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.200]   all of that isn't working to rely on supplement based tools
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.060]   or on prescription medication.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.060]   So it's clear that vivant, Adderall, Ritalin, et cetera,
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   work for ADHD, but some people choose to rely
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.440]   on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   like L-tyrosine.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.380]   And this focusing exercise essentially consists
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.100]   of spending one to three minutes trying
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.340]   to maintain visual focus.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.680]   And yes, you are allowed to blink.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.600]   I don't know why we tend to stare at something
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.420]   we don't blink, but don't let your eyes dry out.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.440]   And that can increase your ability to focus cognitively.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.840]   And it works.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.800]   And keep in mind that focusing always involves refocusing.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.360]   We covered a beautiful data set, not collected by my lab,
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   by Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU, that at roughly 10 minute,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.080]   it's actually 13 minute a day meditation of the sort
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.200]   where you just focus on your breathing,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.280]   has been shown to improve focus significantly.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.780]   Why don't we hear about this more?
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.920]   Well, she's now Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.860]   and all the students are hearing about it.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.780]   Hopefully they're doing it,
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.260]   but it takes a little bit of discipline.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.860]   For some reason, 10 minute a day type meditation
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.240]   is something that very few people follow consistently.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.300]   But if you're looking for non medication based treatments
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.000]   for ADHD or you're somebody who just struggles with focus,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.140]   the focusing exercise or the meditation I just described
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.320]   can be very useful, so say the data.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.380]   Yeah, thanks for bringing up space time bridging.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.300]   Are people familiar with what space time bridging is?
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.140]   I haven't talked a lot about it.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.340]   Okay, this is, thanks for bringing that up.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.620]   We actually have an episode on meditation coming up soon
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.900]   where I cover it and I talked about it long ago
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.940]   and then I kind of abandoned it
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.980]   because well, we wanted more data
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.060]   and it's a pretty interesting technique.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.580]   If you think about the nervous system
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.180]   and vision in particular,
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.460]   but if you're not a sighted person,
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.500]   you're low vision or no vision,
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.700]   you could do this with your hearing,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.160]   but I'm gonna assume most people here are sighted.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.460]   If not, just translate this to the auditory system.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.000]   You have this incredible ability to close your eyes
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.220]   and focus for instance on,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.020]   people talk about the third eye center,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.500]   focusing right behind your forehead.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.660]   Do you know why people do that when they meditate?
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.400]   The reason is that you actually have no sensation
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.260]   in your brain.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.700]   It's the one place to focus your attention
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.980]   for which you abandon sensation.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.700]   If I think about any portion of my body or my breathing,
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.140]   I'm going to sense what's happening.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.660]   I'm going to perceive my inner landscape,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.500]   so-called interoception,
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   or my outer, if I look out into the world,
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.980]   it's exteroception.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.860]   When you focus your attention with your eyes closed,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.660]   you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead,
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.080]   you are focusing on your thinking.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.260]   Sort of obvious, but I don't,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.300]   at least to me it had never been stated that clearly.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.100]   Again, one of the problems
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.060]   with some of the more traditional practices,
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.760]   but also the problem with science
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.420]   is that there's a shrouding of everything
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.360]   in very complex language,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.240]   which sucks.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.080]   Why does it suck?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.060]   Because it's a separator.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.500]   You eliminate the number of people
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.360]   that could be brought to potentially useful practices.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.000]   And I don't like it when people, including myself,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   overuse mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.460]   to mask basic principles.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.340]   So, simplest language, I think is a,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.400]   it tends to unify people around the practices.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.940]   So when you focus on this so-called third eye center,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.560]   or a spot right behind your forehead or on your breath,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.660]   it's a little tricky with the breath,
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.460]   but when you focus on your frontal cortex,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.940]   there's nothing to sense
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.760]   because there's no sensory neurons there.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.640]   There's no touch, there's no pain, nothing.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.200]   That's why in these gory movies,
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   you can take the skull off.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.040]   Or in neurosurgeries, they're poking around in there,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.080]   and the person's playing a violin.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   No anesthetic, no anesthetic.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.920]   Doesn't require anesthetic, there's no sensory neurons.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.280]   Can't sense anything there.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.860]   So, space-time bridging involves,
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.040]   it's essentially a meditation,
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.020]   but it's really a perceptual exercise.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.520]   I think that's where we're going with this.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.540]   Is it starts by closing your eyes
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.060]   and focusing on that location
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.960]   for which there's no sensation, there's only thought.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.780]   And then opening your eyes and focusing on a location,
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.780]   maybe about the distance of your hand.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.420]   And you focus also on your breathing.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.640]   So you sort of imagine a kind of a tether between that.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.480]   You can split your attention to these two locations.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.660]   You're thinking about your body
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.660]   and you're thinking about a location outside of you.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.540]   And then you, while continuing to think about your body,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.460]   so-called interoception, focus on your breathing,
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.900]   you focus further out, and then further out,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.740]   and then further out.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.200]   And then ultimately, you know that little cartoon or meme
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.960]   where they're like, we're just a little blue dot
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.220]   floating in a big universe,
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.060]   and it's supposed to make all your problems go away?
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.700]   Like, it kind of works because what you've done
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.840]   is you've expanded your perception and you go,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.540]   oh yeah, like the stuff that's happening in here
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.500]   is really important when I'm focused
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.600]   on what's happening in here.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.760]   But when I'm focused on what's going on
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.300]   and the kind of the vastness of all this,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.220]   and we're just a little, you know,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.860]   pale blue dot and all that, it changes your perception.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.320]   Not just your visual perception, obviously,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.180]   changing your visual perception
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.580]   changes your cognitive perception,
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.580]   which changes your emotional experience.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.820]   So the space-time bridging is a perceptual exercise
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.420]   where you step from focusing internally
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.560]   to focusing externally at a short distance,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.780]   then a further distance, further distance, further distance,
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.740]   and then trying to imagine yourself
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.980]   in this larger landscape.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.820]   It sounds very mystical,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.860]   but it's actually very neurobiological,
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.720]   and it captures something really amazing.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.060]   Why is the T in there, the time, space-time bridging?
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.220]   'Cause this is space, but time is in there
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.480]   because when you focus in close,
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.260]   your slicing of time is finer.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.700]   You notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.300]   and things that are happening up close.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.440]   Whereas when you focus further out,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.040]   your perception of time actually changes,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.120]   which is why in panoramic vision we are calm.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.360]   And when you think about we're just a pale blue dot
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.060]   and we mostly only live to about 85
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.200]   or maybe 100 years old,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.740]   and then like what's happening right now,
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.180]   my boss being a jerk and all that doesn't really matter
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.920]   because, you know, like the earth is spinning
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.460]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.780]   which is all true and is the stuff of philosophy
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.620]   and mindfulness and I think is beautiful.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.140]   What you're really doing is you're changing
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.220]   your time perception by changing your space perception.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.060]   So space-time bridging is very useful
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.060]   because most people get locked at one step,
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.100]   one of these stations,
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.820]   especially under conditions of stress.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.460]   And people who have trouble focusing,
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.740]   I'm glad you brought this up in this context of ADHD,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.300]   people who have a hard time focusing
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.380]   whether or not they have ADHD or not
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.820]   tend to skip back and forth between different space-time
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.480]   domains as we call them in science.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.780]   So this is a simple exercise that you can do
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.360]   focusing internally then stepping out externally
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.900]   and then stepping back in,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.020]   all the while paying attention to your inner landscape
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.560]   just simply by focusing on your breathing.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.660]   It's a tool that we're still collecting data on
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.140]   in terms of its utility, but people are already using it.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.820]   And I don't think of it as a meditation,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.100]   I think of it as a perceptual exercise.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.500]   Thanks for asking that.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.060]   Okay, as a teenager, what are five things
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.860]   you would recommend to physically feel my best?
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.720]   I'm a 15-year-old surfer who attends high school
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.900]   and plays soccer.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.300]   Well, it sounds like you're doing a lot of things right.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:11.740]   To physically feel your best.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.680]   Okay, so I'm gonna grasp at some context here
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.020]   that I'm not, that's not within reach.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.100]   I'm assuming if you are doing all these things,
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.220]   you're hopefully doing a bunch of other things too
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.740]   and they're going to be demands on you that you,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.300]   probably some of them you don't want to do school
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.060]   and things like that, are going to have varying levels
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.460]   of like joy and delight and demand
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.660]   of things you don't want to do.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.620]   I don't want to default always to the simplest of tools,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.780]   but I certainly think that even as a 15-year-old,
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.940]   if you're not already getting lots and lots of sleep,
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.980]   that's going to be great.
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.620]   Tell your parents that I said you should get
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.420]   lots and lots of sleep
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.180]   while you're not sleeping through classes.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.940]   I am a professor after all, I couldn't tell you otherwise.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.260]   I would say if I could travel back in time,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.820]   as a 15-year-old, I would encourage you
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.780]   to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practice.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.660]   I know this sounds a little cliche,
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.100]   but having some awareness of your thinking
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.780]   about your thinking is good,
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.240]   but I'm actually not going to say sit down
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.940]   and meditate for 10 minutes a day or do NSDR.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.380]   I'm actually not going to tell you that.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.180]   I think given how plastic your brain is,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.720]   how much it's changing at 15,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.700]   I would encourage you,
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.600]   and maybe you would set a timer for this,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.240]   to actually develop just a really keen awareness
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.140]   of what stresses you out, what relaxes you,
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.580]   what delights you, et cetera,
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.460]   and just to simply develop an awareness of that
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.340]   because those are your antennae.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.300]   And I certainly had a meditation practice as a youth,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.860]   mostly given to me because I was a little haywire
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.100]   and I needed it, and it worked pretty well,
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.540]   but I think in retrospect, what I wish I had developed
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.460]   was more of a sense of how I navigated stress
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.500]   or things I enjoyed and things I didn't enjoy,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.900]   and I would just encourage you to have a general awareness,
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.380]   try and detect and learn about what raises your adrenaline,
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.420]   what raises your dopamine, what raises your serotonin,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.980]   and then start thinking about tools.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.020]   But again, the awareness is going to be very valuable,
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.700]   and gosh, as a 15-year-old, you are in this amazing,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.660]   blessed period of heightened neuroplasticity.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.700]   Should we all be so lucky, so enjoy it.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.620]   Next question, please.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.580]   Clarity on adrenaline regarding cold water.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.460]   Should we wait to feel the rise of adrenaline,
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.780]   the get-me-out-of-here feeling,
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.420]   and the fall of it before bailing?
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.900]   Yes.
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.420]   Provided it doesn't kill you.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.340]   You know, I don't want to say cold water,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.420]   it's hard to kill yourself with cold water,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.300]   provided your head's above and you're breathing,
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   but the, it's, sorry, my podcast producer's always,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.460]   I can't help that anyway.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.580]   It's, it's a great tool,
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.540]   and different days it'll feel different.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.780]   So for instance, doing cold, any kind of adrenaline
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.740]   and deliberate cold exposure
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.660]   or adrenaline-increasing activity early in the day,
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.380]   you might find that you are more quote-unquote
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.940]   resilient than later.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.220]   In other words, the wall, like,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.740]   I really don't want to do this.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.580]   This is actually interesting for, I think,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.460]   it extends beyond cold water.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.660]   Let's say you really don't want to do something.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.980]   Pay attention to the fact
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.820]   that maybe it's not the right thing to do.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.940]   But assuming it's something that you know you should do,
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.340]   but you don't want to do,
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.660]   you are already in the first wall of adrenaline.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.380]   You don't experience it necessarily
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.700]   as heightened levels of stress.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.100]   You might experience it as heightened levels of fatigue
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.780]   or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.580]   that's required to move through the thing.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   But I do encourage you to take advantage of that.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.060]   Of course, and we have an episode coming out tomorrow,
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.420]   actually, that answers questions like,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.780]   should you train if you're sick?
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.980]   And, you know, what if you travel?
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.660]   And, you know, there's context always.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.340]   But I think that you do want to experience,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.700]   if you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.420]   and to be more specific, the adrenaline,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.940]   then you want to get to that point of,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.300]   I really want to get out of here,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.780]   but I know I can stay in safely,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.780]   but I really want to get out of here.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.340]   And it's a little hard to explain,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.220]   but there's just so much learning in those short moments
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.580]   about where your mind goes.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.020]   And this sounds very kind of, again, subjective
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.100]   and maybe a little wishy-washy,
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.860]   but you can realize great things about yourself
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.700]   in those moments.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.860]   You can find insight in those moments.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.180]   Also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort,
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.740]   not just physical, but mental discomfort,
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.640]   is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.860]   that you'll experience afterwards.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.900]   The reason it feels so good
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.220]   when you get out of the ice bath and you're showered off,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.600]   I always do the warm shower after.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.780]   I don't do this end on cold thing.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.620]   I don't know.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.060]   It just seems a little too painful.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.580]   And then take a warm shower and then you feel great.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.100]   And that's the surge of dopamine
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.980]   that we know based on a paper published
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.860]   in the European Journal of Physiology lasts many hours
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.860]   and it's a 100 to 200% increase in dopamine.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.620]   It is not a subtle effect.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.840]   And then people say, well, wait,
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.900]   is that dopamine going to crash my dopamine system?
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.080]   No, because there's a nice slow rise.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.620]   In fact, I'm actually not aware of many things
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.100]   besides love and delight that can create this long,
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.220]   slow arc of dopamine lasting many hours.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.560]   Maybe you're aware of other things.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.900]   If you are, let me know.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.900]   But it turns out that long arc is a true antidepressant.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.600]   And my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lemke,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.640]   who's the head of our dual diagnosis addiction clinic,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.760]   has talked about in her amazing book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.260]   about patients of hers
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.580]   that have really helped themselves along
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.260]   and out of the more depressive phases
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.060]   of working through addiction
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.160]   and in just depression in general
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.100]   through directed cold water therapy.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.880]   So I'm obviously a fanatic about it
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.340]   in the sense that it's a powerful,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.980]   relatively safe if done properly way
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.940]   to modulate your internal dopamine.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.260]   Hopefully I answered your question.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.380]   Next question, please.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.500]   Sorry, I caught it raised, it went off.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.900]   The fall as well.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.480]   Yes, I think you should get out
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.560]   once you've accomplished something.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.020]   Don't get out when you panic unless it's dangerous, sorry.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.840]   How can you train your brain to feel more confident
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.700]   in moments where you tend to feel intimidated?
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.140]   Ah, okay.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.820]   These are hard question.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.980]   Because context is tricky here
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.100]   'cause I don't know what the context is.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.340]   And confidence on short timescales
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.400]   and then long timescales.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.700]   So confidence in school, confidence in career,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.940]   those are long arc things,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.880]   whereas confidence to be able to do something
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.540]   in the short term is different.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.600]   But remember those action sequences
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.540]   that trigger the release of dopamine.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.220]   Dopamine, I've mainly talked about the dark side of dopamine
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.280]   but I hopefully also talked about the sort of upward spiral
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.960]   that dopamine can cause mainly by thinking about delight
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.180]   and things that you really enjoy.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.560]   That carries over.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   And I would say that you want to micro slice
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.700]   the demands of what's maybe got you back
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.300]   on your heels a bit.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.820]   Actually a good friend of mine who's here tonight,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.580]   I think also my friend Pat,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.300]   he has a great way of conceptualizing this,
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.900]   which is for most all endeavors
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.340]   we either feel back on our heels,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.300]   flat-footed or forward center of mass.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.020]   Like we can really do something.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.480]   We're flat-footed, we're back on our heels.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.980]   And sometimes getting from back on our heels,
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.700]   let's call that lack of confidence
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.860]   to just on two feet and confident enough to move forward
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.000]   or at least stay in the game.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.060]   That's going to require, you could lean on different tools.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.040]   I can't say which would be ideal
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.660]   for the circumstance you have in mind.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.220]   But I do think that having a way to calm yourself
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.220]   will give you access to more resources, internal resources.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.060]   We know this.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.280]   This was something I meant to bring up
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.700]   during the discussion about fear versus love, et cetera,
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.260]   trying to access delight and love.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.900]   When we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety,
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.080]   the rule set, the options available to us
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.780]   and indeed our creativity is greatly diminished.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.140]   And this has to do with the way
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.240]   that the prefrontal cortex interacts
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.980]   with an area of the brain called the insula,
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.100]   which relates to our internal landscape.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.160]   And there's this weird phenomenon,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.940]   which is that normally our brain, our thinking brain
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.060]   and our rule setting brain can,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.060]   it leads our, the brain parts that control
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.260]   and pay attention to how we feel internally.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.260]   And that's why, for instance, if you feel a little nervous,
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.580]   you can still do something.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.940]   At some point you get stressed enough
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.700]   and we know this from work by my colleague, David Spiegel,
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.620]   it reverses and these areas of the brain
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.660]   that are paying attention, like how flushed my face is
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.460]   or whether or not I'm sweating or my breathing
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.920]   actually start to shut down creative decision-making.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.860]   So I would say the way to have more confidence
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.260]   is to learn to control that stress
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.040]   and keep the part of your brain,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.780]   the prefrontal cortex is that part,
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.600]   that can come up with new rules that can be funny,
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   that can be creative, that keeps that brain part leading.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.900]   The way you think about this is the prefrontal cortex
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.540]   is sort of like the coach and the rest of your brain
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.540]   are sort of like the players.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.440]   And if you get too stressed,
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.100]   the players start to lead the game and the coach follows
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.000]   and kind of drags them along.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.700]   So I would encourage you to focus
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.780]   on real-time stress modulation
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.860]   and to raise your stress threshold
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.940]   using the sorts of tools we talked about
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.860]   and to register your wins.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.580]   I didn't get into this in too much detail,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.060]   but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.920]   is that it's highly subject to your interpretation.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.380]   If you tell yourself that a fail was a win
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.740]   and you can see or conceptualize some way
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.020]   in which that's actually true,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.920]   you get to tap into the dopamine system.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.880]   You might think that's crazy.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.220]   You can cheat your own brain.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.020]   You can cheat your own neurochemistry and indeed you can.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.880]   You can change the time space, time referencing.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.840]   We see this with examples like Nelson Mandela
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.700]   or Viktor Frankl.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.160]   You know, you read their stories, right?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   Trapped in little cells, right?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.620]   Confined, imprisoned, and they come up with new ways
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.140]   to access the dopamine system
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.920]   by now not thinking about what they're not getting,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.540]   but thinking about what they can control
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.060]   in their immediate experience.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.100]   Many, many examples of this
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.140]   throughout literature and history.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.580]   And the dopamine system is the life force system.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.220]   I don't say that in any loose way.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.820]   Dopamine is life force.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.820]   It's the wish and the desire to continue.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.740]   It's persistence.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.000]   And so if you can think about
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.760]   what might seem like a failure
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.340]   and really spend some time thinking about
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.660]   not the potential wins on the outside,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.220]   but how you can conceptualize that
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.980]   as a potential win internally,
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.980]   you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:43.220]   and that chemical win sets you up for more real wins.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.420]   If that makes sense.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.160]   It's incredible how contextualized the dopamine system is,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.340]   but if it weren't, why would it matter
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.220]   if we're talking about money or mates or food
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.300]   or job or school?
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.060]   You don't get 50 reward systems and motivation systems.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.700]   You get one, and that's the dopamine system.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.580]   Next question, please.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.300]   What is the competing mechanism
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.580]   behind bilateral eye movement, EMDR,
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.200]   that helps resolve psychological trauma?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.800]   The competing mechanism.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   Well, let me try and answer as best I can.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   I'm not sure I understand the full extent of the question,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   but EMDR, moving your eyes from side to side, right?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   And then recounting a trauma is a very common
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.220]   and actually one of the four approved treatments
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.640]   that are behavioral for trauma.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.840]   So it's taken seriously in the psychiatric
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.020]   and psychological community for good reason.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.760]   It tends to work best for single event traumas
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.380]   as opposed to like entire childhoods.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.220]   No joke there.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.260]   Like some people have their entire childhood was traumatic.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.340]   Other people, they experience a trauma,
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.500]   single event trauma or repeated periods
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.340]   of the same or similar type of trauma.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.580]   Eye movements from side to side have been shown
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.560]   in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.060]   of a brain structure called the amygdala,
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.860]   which most people are familiar with
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.060]   because of the character from the Star Wars movie,
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:15.060]   amygdala, there's a neuroscientist somewhere on that team.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.300]   It is indeed a threat detection center.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.500]   And when you move through space, not outer space,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.860]   but when you walk like this,
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.260]   your eyes actually generate these subtle side to side shifts
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.100]   unless you're focusing on a specific target.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.380]   And my lab and other laboratories have found
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.660]   that that leads to a very potent quieting
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.140]   of the threat detection system.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.420]   And then EMDR is essentially a process
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.100]   of pairing that calmer state
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.260]   with no threat detection system activated
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.500]   with the recount of something
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.420]   that normally would be quite triggering.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.500]   So it's, you've heard of Pavlovian conditioning,
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.260]   like a bell rings and the animal gets fed
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.560]   and animal salivates.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.100]   Eventually just the bell will evoke the salivation.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.820]   You're doing the reverse of that.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.020]   It's called behavioral desensitization.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.380]   It has an underlying mechanism, et cetera.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.660]   But the idea is to pair a calm state
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.980]   with recount of something.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.980]   It has been shown to be successful.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.380]   There are people who think that
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.300]   the side to side eye movements and the recount of trauma
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.700]   may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.220]   My colleague, David Spiegel's expert in clinical hypnosis.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.820]   He's appeared on my podcast, Rich Roll's podcast
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.740]   and a few other podcasts and talks about this.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.300]   It is not staged hypnosis, it's clinical hypnosis.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.640]   So there may be something going on there.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.480]   EMDR, again, some people get great relief from it,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.380]   other people don't.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.740]   What's kind of nice is that this eye movements
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.820]   from side to side or simply taking a walk
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.320]   as long as you're not looking at your phone
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.120]   and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.260]   is a very good way to shut down the fear and stress system.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.020]   So taking a walk, I think is relaxing for obvious reasons.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.080]   And there are data showing that part of the reason
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.420]   why animals scratch at the door and wanna go for a walk
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.820]   may not actually be the exercise.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.060]   There's kind of an anxiety and then an anxiety relief
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.580]   that occurs.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.600]   Of course, they probably have to go to the bathroom too.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.400]   One of Costello's great joys in life
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.240]   was just peeing on everything.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.940]   Outdoors, thankfully.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.580]   So the psychological trauma rewiring,
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.380]   unfortunately, there haven't been a lot of brain imaging
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.620]   studies looking at this long term of how well EMDR works.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.660]   What I think is going to happen in the next few years,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.840]   by the way, is it is not going to be a discussion around,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.980]   should you do EMDR?
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.140]   Should you do transcranial magnetic stimulation?
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.700]   Should you do behavioral therapy?
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.820]   It's going to be combination therapies.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.180]   Combination therapies, including pharmacologic manipulations
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   to essentially give a boost to the systems
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.160]   that encourage neuroplasticity like dopamine and serotonin
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.060]   and adrenaline, and then also then perform EMDR.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.980]   And if you wanna talk about what's happening
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.580]   in the landscape of clinical trials
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.640]   on some of the psychedelics, I'm happy to talk about it.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.400]   They're still illegal, but they are being used
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.080]   in clinical trials and very interesting stuff
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   is happening there.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.860]   Okay, next question, please.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.880]   What new research or interventions are you most excited
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.560]   about in the realm of health and wellness?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.240]   So what I think is going to be very interesting
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.480]   in the next few years really reflects my obsession
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.160]   that you've seen a little bit of tonight.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.320]   But the thing that I think is going to be most useful,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.960]   and I've seen this in science before,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.680]   and I think we're going to see it in health and wellness,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.560]   is that there are all these tools and all these people
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.640]   and he's saying this and she's saying that
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.160]   and what we're going to start paying attention to
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.400]   is what are the common themes, right?
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.640]   And a broader and more important theme is going to be one
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.540]   of modulation versus mediation.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.520]   What do I mean?
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.840]   Well, if someone were to pull a fire alarm right now
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.660]   and please don't, that will shift our attention
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.400]   and make it hard to focus on what I'm saying
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.100]   and knowing me, I'd probably just stay up here talking.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.060]   Do we think that fire alarms mediate attention?
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.840]   No, they modulate it, right?
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.360]   If it were very, very cold in this room
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.820]   like it was when we first got here tonight,
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.400]   we were arctic cold.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.460]   Hopefully it's warmed up a bit.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.360]   It hasn't, I'm so sorry.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.400]   So sorry.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.940]   Yeah, I attempted to, yeah.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.340]   I almost thought maybe we all just do a bunch of breathing
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.940]   to heat up, like adrenaline release.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.340]   But I don't know, these days,
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.180]   getting groups of people to all breathe on each other
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.980]   is not exactly, I can see that might go the wrong way
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.260]   in terms of what people interpret.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.260]   So the idea here is that certain things
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.280]   directly mediate something.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.500]   Like a physiological side directly calms you down quickly.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.580]   It mediates the calming response.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.820]   Getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.100]   It modulates stress, but is sleeping
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.660]   directly mediating stress control?
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.060]   No, and I think this is really important
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.860]   and this brings up the topic of the gut-brain axis.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.400]   The gut is rich with these little bugs,
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.720]   bacteria, trillions of them,
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.520]   which is an eerie thought to me.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.940]   But also the surface of your skin,
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.020]   the surface of your eyes.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.140]   You have a skin microbiome, a nasal microbiome.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.980]   Every mucosal lining has a microbiome.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.180]   In fact, think about this, this is a crazy
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.020]   but worthwhile tangent.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.720]   Have you ever bitten the inside of your mouth?
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.560]   It sucks, right?
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.340]   And you get a cut and it hurts, but guess what?
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.500]   The inside of your mouth heals without a scar.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.560]   Think about that.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.400]   Weird, right?
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.980]   You cut anywhere else on your body
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.620]   and depending on how well you heal
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.680]   and your age and your immune status, you get a scar.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.100]   Your mouth is filled with bacteria
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.860]   and it's open to the world.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.780]   But the gut microbiome, provided it's healthy,
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.140]   provides an incredible ability to heal quickly.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.140]   And I'm not somebody who's done a lot of acupuncture.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.220]   I've went a few times and now there's interesting science
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.140]   happening on acupuncture, but what's the first thing they do
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.300]   when you walk in there?
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.780]   And then they go, oh yeah.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.420]   And they have this cool intuition
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.920]   that's not based on Western mechanistic science.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.700]   It's more of an intuition based on millions,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.300]   if not billions, of data points
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.020]   that have been put into these charts.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.340]   It's pretty cool, right?
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.540]   And what they are looking at, I believe,
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.740]   and from what my colleagues who work on microbiome tell me,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.100]   is they can look at the pallor of your tongue,
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.540]   in particular in the back, and get a sense
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.720]   of whether or not the microbiome there
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.620]   is of the appropriate stuff.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.540]   But they don't go, oh, lactobacillus and then bacillus.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.100]   They all on to illus, right?
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.500]   Oh, you're dysbiotic.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.140]   Instead, they get a sense.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.300]   Now, parents of small babies learn to detect
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.020]   all sorts of things coming out of essentially
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.860]   every orifice of the child as a readout of health
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.780]   because the child doesn't have language.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.340]   And a dog owner, unfortunately,
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.100]   he learned to do this too, for better or for worse,
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.440]   probably for better, right?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.500]   So we have this intuition about gut health,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.020]   but gut health would be another example
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.780]   where it's very clear now that fiber can be helpful,
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.460]   but it's mostly consuming these fermented foods
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.260]   that have been used for ages,
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.780]   but low-sugar fermented foods of the natto,
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.420]   kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, et cetera.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.980]   All these things, depending on which culture you're in,
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.660]   they come in different forms, certain yogurts, et cetera,
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.380]   that allow the gut to be healthy,
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.360]   and it modulates a huge number of systems.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.500]   So I don't think that you're going to cure depression
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.660]   by adjusting your gut microbiome,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.960]   but if your gut microbiota are not well,
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.500]   and you improve that,
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.140]   it will indeed shift the neurotransmitter systems
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.540]   of your brain and give you a elevated mood.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.400]   That shouldn't come as a surprise anymore,
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.200]   but I think that the whole world thinks like,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.340]   gosh, it must be the serotonin in the gut.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.600]   No, it's actually not serotonin in the gut,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.860]   it's that the gut microbiota create chemicals
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.660]   that actually become serotonin in the brain
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.780]   or become dopamine in the brain.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.680]   And so I think that the gut microbiome,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.180]   I would put in the same category,
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.060]   although not quite as important,
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.040]   I would put it in the category of like sleep.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.600]   It modulates a huge number of other processes,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.580]   it doesn't mediate them.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.200]   So sunlight, sleep, healthy gut microbiome,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.060]   exercise, good nutrition, social connection,
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.760]   these things all create this general milieu
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.940]   or environment of health.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.700]   I would like to see more distinction
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.580]   between modulating and mediating
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.520]   to effects and tools out there
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.900]   because I also see a lot of unnecessary argument.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.320]   People are like, there's no example
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.540]   that improving your gut microbiome cures depressions.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.380]   Of course there's not,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.480]   but there are really good examples
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.400]   if your gut microbiome is off
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.680]   that improving it can improve mood,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.400]   which depending on where you are
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.180]   on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.920]   So I think that the future of health,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.600]   we hear so much about personalized medicine
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.740]   and matched to your genome,
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.580]   but we don't even have the basic,
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.320]   most people don't even have the basics right.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   And if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough,
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.840]   hopefully certain themes start to kind of repeat themselves.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.920]   But a key theme that you learn in science,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.480]   you teach your students,
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.360]   does it modulate or does it mediate it?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.600]   You need to be careful with your language there.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.320]   And there's great information
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.660]   or as we say, interpretational power there.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.680]   If you understand the difference,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.600]   then I think we can go a long way
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.800]   by making that distinction modulating versus mediating.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.980]   There are probably other things that modulate health
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.160]   that I'm overlooking now
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.020]   just because of the flow that I'm in.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.280]   The cool mitt, yeah.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.680]   The cool mitt, Palmer cooling.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.240]   Okay, I promised to talk about Palmer cooling.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.300]   Well, I'll do it now.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.980]   Palmer cooling, they changed the Q&A format.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.820]   What can I say?
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.020]   This is like teaching in the classroom.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.960]   All right, very briefly that Palmer cooling,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.280]   which is essentially placing,
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.800]   you can cool the core of the body most quickly
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.160]   by placing cold objects on the hands,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.680]   the bottoms of the feet or on the top of the face
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.560]   because of the arrangement of vasculature.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.000]   Normally, you've got this arteries, capillaries, veins things
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.520]   but at those locations in the body,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.720]   you skip the capillaries and you can basically,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.380]   you're not really passing cool into the body
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.020]   but you're cooling off the core of the body more quickly.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.420]   And if you do that in between sets of exercise
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.300]   or during a run or cycling,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.880]   you can dramatically increase your ability to continue.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.800]   I actually use the cool mitt for cognitive work
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.360]   but you don't need a cool mitt.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.400]   Sorry, cool mitt guys.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.800]   You can just get a thing of ice water
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.640]   or just very cold water and you,
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.080]   I know it sounds trivially easy
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.960]   but you're actually just cooling your core
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.620]   by putting your hands or even one hand
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.320]   on a relatively cold thing of water or ice
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.340]   but not so cold that it constricts the vasculature there.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.940]   This is the incredible work of my colleague at Stanford,
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.660]   Dr. Craig Heller.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.320]   Why wouldn't more people do this
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.100]   if you can double the amount of endurance believe it or not
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.620]   or double the number of sets of exercise you can do
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.980]   or feel more alert and do more cognitive work?
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.420]   Why wouldn't more people do it?
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.720]   Because people just don't do it and it sounds crazy.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.220]   It really sounds crazy but it's a real thing
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.460]   and I wish more people would do it.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.320]   The athletes at Stanford do it.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.340]   People in the military do it.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.280]   So people who know know and they use it, enjoy it.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   It's just, it's almost like seems too off target
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.300]   from what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.260]   I don't know, for some reason,
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.820]   people are finally on board breathing.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.020]   Like in a specific way as a useful tool.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.780]   A few years ago, no one was into that.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.600]   I mean, just think of how far we've come.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.000]   It's incredible.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.500]   People are talking about psychedelics,
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.380]   meditation, breathing.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.360]   I think the pandemic for all its pains
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.420]   and what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.060]   did wake people up to the idea
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.860]   that you have to take control over your health
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.500]   because there's no magic fairy coming to do it for you.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.440]   And with all due respect, there's no government agency
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.460]   that's gonna like drop off the kit at your front door
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.500]   of like, here's how you take good care of yourself.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.440]   So it's just not gonna happen.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.620]   And it wouldn't happen under any circumstances.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.980]   So it's a personal responsibility issue.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.180]   All right, what lessons from skateboarding?
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.280]   The failure part, you know, the failure, failure, failure.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.860]   I mean, for me, you know,
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.980]   never was a good skateboarder.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.060]   Still have close friends in that community
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.520]   and our photographer and a guy who does all the visuals
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.960]   and the other guys that do the visuals for our podcast,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.840]   Mike playback and Chris and Martin are all of that community.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.060]   You know, I think that for me,
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.480]   that community was really, as Mike will sometimes say,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.980]   skateboarders hate everything.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.620]   Meaning they have a very high threshold
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.180]   for what they consider acceptable.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.500]   It's not just what you do, it's how you do it.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.880]   Super important.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.020]   And I think in neuroscience,
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.220]   there's a lot of stuff.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.940]   In science in general, there's so many papers
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.200]   and there's so many experiments,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   like how do you navigate that landscape?
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.860]   I think it helped me develop a sense of taste.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.100]   But the taste that I'm referring to
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.240]   is not necessarily a taste of which science is cool
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.860]   or not cool, that too.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.820]   But it came through a few times tonight
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.520]   when I was talking about my mentors.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.420]   You know, I picked back then skateboarding
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.220]   'cause I really liked the people.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.040]   And also you didn't need your parents to go to a game.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.340]   And so that worked for me.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.940]   And you could kind of make your own schedule.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.260]   And I do think it's very important
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.140]   to the extent that you can in science
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.780]   and in everything to surround yourself
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.620]   with the kinds of people
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.780]   that you just really enjoy being around.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.100]   And so to me, the podcast running a lab
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.880]   feels a lot like skateboarding.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.900]   It's the same energy, it's the same neurochemical systems
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.980]   firing, so that's, yeah, that one.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.500]   Next, favorite Feynman.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.680]   Oh, oh wait, no, that's inappropriate.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.980]   I do have a Feynman story, but it's inappropriate.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.660]   Darn it.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.260]   Maybe some time.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.060]   This is why I don't drink.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.220]   Good decision making.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:25.180]   Well, I read all of Feynman's books.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.620]   So I had the pleasure, I never met him.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.880]   He was dead before I was born.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.200]   But my dad did and he had good Feynman stories
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.600]   and they were inappropriate.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.380]   So the cool thing about Feynman, right,
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.720]   was that he didn't really care
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.940]   if people understood the specifics
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.620]   of what he was talking about.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.500]   He just wanted people to get turned on
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.300]   to how amazing physics was and he loved general principles.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.860]   And one of the things, the example that's sometimes given,
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.140]   I don't know how many of you are familiar
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.660]   with the Feynman books, but surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.540]   or what do you care what other people think?
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.180]   All of that stuff, it's wonderful.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.740]   He picked locks, when he worked at Los Alamos Labs,
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.100]   they were working on the bomb.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.260]   And he basically, well, there and elsewhere.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.620]   And every morning, the offices used to come in
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.740]   and he would spread all the top secret papers
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.740]   out on the floor.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.220]   He would break into the safes at night
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.700]   and then they were perplexed who could do this.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.060]   And he liked safe cracking,
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.580]   literally like national security secrets,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.660]   just for fun, prankster.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.540]   He also bongo drum naked on the roof of Caltech.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.860]   And he did most of his writing of theorems
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.620]   in strip clubs, in fact.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:39.180]   Learned to draw late in life,
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:44.180]   was really into flotation tanks and very curious about,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.060]   but never did psychedelics.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   That's as I understand.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.140]   But one of the cool Feynman factoids
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.340]   is that when he was a kid,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.420]   he talked about when he was a child
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.660]   that his dad used to take him bird watching.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.420]   And he'd say, well, that's a whatever scrub Jay
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.380]   and that's a whatever thrush.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.020]   And his dad said, no,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:10.500]   don't cloud your mind with naming and taxonomy.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.380]   That's not meaningful.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.340]   Because then what if it's the different,
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.340]   the pygmy thrush or the lesser this or that.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.900]   The more important thing is to start to identify principles
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.140]   of why certain birds behave one way
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.180]   and certain birds behave another
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.460]   and to start finding the commonalities and the regularities.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.460]   And that's a theme that I obviously tonight
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.340]   have tried to impose.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.020]   And it's actually something that I can't do in podcasts,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.860]   necessarily, 'cause I can't thread across 40 episodes
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.020]   or something like that in the same way
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.820]   that I could in an evening like this.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.860]   So that's an appropriate Feynman story.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.180]   Also, it just seemed like a delightful guy.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.020]   And he's kind of cool.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.200]   He's a little bit street, right?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.340]   He had that thick accent.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.300]   He was from Far Rockaway,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.540]   but he didn't really care much what people thought.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.700]   Or he did and he pretended he didn't.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.620]   Careful when people tell you
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.980]   they don't care what people think.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.300]   I think he did to the extent that it's still to allow him
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.340]   to get the message out there.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.640]   Okay, next question, please.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.340]   My horse.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.220]   Wow.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.700]   I love this.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.340]   I delight in all things animals, but especially horses,
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.400]   because my high school girlfriend had a horse.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.700]   And they do that thing where people go,
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.780]   oh, horses can detect how they know more about you
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.600]   than you know.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.260]   And then I get into the horse and the horse is like this.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.060]   And it's like a litmus test.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.140]   Having a girlfriend with a horse
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.620]   was very intimidating for me, actually.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.100]   I felt like I had to compete with the horse.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.780]   She spent all this time with the horse.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.980]   She was very large, very like, you know.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:52.520]   Anyway, eventually I broke the horse.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.100]   Okay, my horse does the double inhale long exhale often.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.340]   He's a bit of a stressy guy.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.300]   Warm blood, yeah, warm blood.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.820]   I used to work at the barn.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.960]   I used to shovel manure and work at the barn.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.240]   She brought her horse to college.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.780]   That's how she followed her off to college.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.900]   I never would have gone to college
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.460]   if she hadn't gone to college.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.600]   And the horses are interesting animals.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.860]   They do tell you a lot.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.540]   The horse does the double inhale long exhale often.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.700]   He's a bit of a stressy guy.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.240]   Do you suppose this physiological stress
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.180]   regularly transcends for you?
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.780]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.220]   In fact, I mentioned warm bloods, right?
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.620]   I have a colleague at Stanford.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.180]   She's amazing.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.200]   Her name is Sue McConnell
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.340]   and she is an expert in dog genetics.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.240]   So you can imagine I'm always asking her questions.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.820]   And we talk about dogs and we talk about horses
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.640]   because she also, I think she raises warm bloods.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.260]   And you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.380]   and you also, if you have any familiarity with dogs,
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.100]   there are dogs like Costello
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.020]   where like a nuclear bomb could go off
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.800]   and Costello might open an eye.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.080]   That's the bulldog, economy of effort.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.760]   They're not going to get activated
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.080]   unless there's a reason to do it.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.780]   They are very, as we call, parasympathetic dominant.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.780]   That seesaw of autonomic arousal
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.060]   is just really, really relaxed.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.000]   Getting them into action is more of an effort.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   There are other animals like the whippet, right?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.160]   Or the Italian greyhound, like they're always cold,
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.180]   that are very sympathetic dominant.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.580]   And then of course, within a breed
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.820]   or within a species, there's a range.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.500]   And humans also out within a range.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.500]   I think anyone who's had children will tell you,
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.800]   he or she has been like this since birth.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.760]   Calm, easygoing, or like really easily stressed.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.220]   I think that seesaw, we didn't get into tonight too much,
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.520]   but there's a concept with the autonomic regulation
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.840]   of a hinge.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.880]   So don't think so much about being really stressed out
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.860]   or really relaxed, but certain animals,
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.880]   the hinge is tightened so that the seesaw
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.580]   just kind of tilts mellow like Costello.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.500]   A bulldog almost seems like a different animal
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.060]   than a whippet.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.880]   They're so very different.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.940]   And within the category of horses,
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.060]   and I'm not an expert in horse genetics,
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.780]   but they are selected for,
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.260]   not just for their physical attributes,
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   but for their psychological or temperament attributes.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.180]   And you see this in dogs too.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.020]   In fact, the reason I picked Costello,
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.500]   and Elvis can verify this story,
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.980]   is I wanted a dog for so many years,
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.620]   and I went there, and there were all these puppies,
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.260]   and I was like, I heard you need to take them
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.180]   in the other room, one by one,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.820]   and then if it barks for its siblings,
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.740]   and you're like, oh, it's a healthy puppy.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.260]   So I walk in and all the dogs are running around like crazy.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.940]   It was right around Christmas time, right Elvis?
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.140]   And they're running around,
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.260]   and then there's one in the back,
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.740]   and he's taking advantage of the fact
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.580]   that all the other ones are waiting,
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.580]   and he's just eating out of all of their bowls.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.660]   And I was like, I want that one.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.740]   So I took that chubby little bastard in the next room,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.780]   and I thought, okay, he's gonna bark for his siblings.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.900]   And he laid down and he took a nap.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.500]   And I was like, this one, I want this one.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.880]   Why did I want that one?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.860]   Well, this completes the principle,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.940]   which is I wanted a dog like that,
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.460]   because I'm not like that.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.100]   And I was very interested in a dog I could take care of,
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.420]   but also a dog that would help regulate my nervous system.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.300]   And so for me, having a dog like that,
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.940]   as opposed to a whippet or something
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.720]   that was gonna, you know, like constantly around
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.940]   is gonna, you know, a very calming effect.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.760]   And to this day, memory of his snoring
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.100]   still puts me to sleep.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.620]   So I think that your horse probably has,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.180]   it kind of idles a little bit higher.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.500]   Think about the RPM, you know,
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.020]   revs a little bit higher at a given speed,
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.440]   higher, more RPM at a given speed.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.140]   That's the way I think about the autonomic system.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.860]   How do you reset that?
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.380]   Well, this is why a lot of exercise is good, right?
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.820]   Incidentally, my girlfriend's horse was crazy.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.540]   It was gelded late, and it was crazy.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.360]   I almost said nuts, but like a bad pun, so right.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.660]   It was not nuts, but it was crazy.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.860]   It was gelded late.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.240]   Next question.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:23.600]   Is there any science behind staying motivated
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.060]   or developing discipline?
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.980]   Ooh, so this represents kind of the higher tier
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.220]   of where I think things are gonna go in the next few years,
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.060]   where we're going to start seeing this convergence
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.680]   of psychology and biology,
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.140]   where we can get to these harder concepts.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.700]   You know, I like to think that we can stay motivated
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.340]   through a simple process that now will make sense to you,
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.500]   because the last thing I covered
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.460]   was toggling back and forth between our ability
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.500]   to be gritty and lean in, kind of in friction,
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.440]   maybe even a little anger, fear, competitiveness, et cetera,
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.820]   that kind of grr, grinding in,
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.400]   but that the more sustaining fuel,
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:07.140]   the sort of hybrid version, right,
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.580]   hybrid fuel model would be one in which you can access that,
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.260]   but that's a depletable and not so renewable resource
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.460]   without a lot of rest,
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.380]   meaning working hard out of anger, determination,
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.080]   and kind of grit will work,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   but when you are depleted, you have to stop for a long while,
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.980]   whereas if you can access this delight system,
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.560]   which is really one of dopamine and serotonin both,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.560]   in other words, and I wanna think of a,
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.260]   not of a different way to put this,
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.380]   but to try and think about what sorts of things and tools
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.260]   allow you to be and feel most loving.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.220]   I know it sounds weak, but it's anything but weak,
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.280]   to be most loving in the verb sense of the word
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.640]   toward what you're doing.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.420]   I actually used to use this trick in college
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.100]   when I'd encounter a topic I hated.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.100]   I would tell myself, I'm really,
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.340]   I'm just gonna fall in love with this
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.220]   by trying to find the gems within it.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.900]   Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't,
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.060]   but the wish to do it that way,
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.100]   as opposed to, okay, I'm just gonna grind this out,
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.340]   at least for me at the time was a powerful tool.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.740]   So motivation and discipline is a tricky one.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.540]   That's sort of the just do it thing.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.480]   You need tools to modulate your stress
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.180]   and to get your sleep, do all the basic things right,
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.640]   set the right context for you to be in your best chance
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.720]   of being disciplined.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.580]   And that itself is its own form of discipline.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.320]   But in terms of continual motivation,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.380]   you're not gonna manage to go against the grain
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.420]   for very long.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:50.100]   People have managed to go against challenge
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.920]   for a very long time, for very long times.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.260]   In fact, I was reading recently
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.240]   about the psychology of people who've been kidnapped.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.900]   And they have this odd trick that they used.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:00.740]   Have you heard about this?
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.900]   It's sort of like Stockholm syndrome,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.840]   but they actually convinced themselves
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.120]   to fall in love with their captors.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.680]   And then they come up with new ways to escape them,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.780]   which is kind of cool.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:14.140]   So there's something about mentally feeling
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.160]   like you're trying to go from back on your heels
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.620]   to flat-footed that's very energetically costly.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.600]   So again, these systems are very susceptible
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.300]   to what we call context or top-down regulation.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.140]   Hopefully that helps.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.700]   I know it's a little bit abstract.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.620]   I wish I could give you a one-minute exercise
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.480]   that would make you motivated.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.320]   But we do talk about tools like to get adrenaline going
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   and things like that.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.140]   But spend some time thinking about what would allow you
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.840]   to sustain effort through positive feelings.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.200]   It's not a light concept at all.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   Okay, next question, please.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.660]   What would be your biggest piece of advice
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.040]   for achieving one's dreams?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.080]   Oi, that's a tough one.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:02.000]   Again, this is gonna be a little abstract.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:11.980]   I'm a believer in this idea of a seed message.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.920]   Robert Greene has talked a lot about this,
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.620]   that we can all kind of think back to a event
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.820]   or stage of our life.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:27.100]   Typically it's before puberty for other reasons
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.620]   that are kind of interesting.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.140]   But where we delight in something.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.380]   So for me it was fish.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.220]   And obviously now I don't need to work on fish.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.460]   It wasn't about the fish.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.660]   I hope that came through.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.780]   I mean, aquaria are really cool.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.300]   But it's not about the fish.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.740]   It was something about the way they moved.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.520]   It was something about the way that it tickled my excitement.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.220]   I used to get dropped off at this little pet shop
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.900]   in California Avenue in Palo Alto called Monet's Pet Shop.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.340]   My mom used it as childcare.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.060]   And she would drop me off there and I had this book
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.280]   and I would log all the tropical fish
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.000]   and which ones could be with which ones.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.240]   And then I was obsessed, right?
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.060]   But for me it was something about organizing
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.540]   and being able to make reliable predictions.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.580]   It was about parsimony.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.780]   It was about principles as opposed to,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.380]   and the colors delighted me and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.000]   The equipment delighted me.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.500]   But then I had puberty and then like it was something else.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.220]   And then I went to college and it was something else.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.420]   And I got a girlfriend and it was something else.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:26.060]   So it changes over time.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.020]   But this is why I recommended to that young 15-year-old person
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.740]   that they learn to tap into that sense of like, oh,
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.380]   like this is cool.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.260]   Like this feels cool.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   I know not everyone else thinks it's cool.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.120]   Maybe they do.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.900]   Like this feels good.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.940]   I actually have a somatic experience of this.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.740]   I'm not a very somatically oriented person.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.820]   I'm more up here.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.540]   But I actually kind of know if I'm
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.460]   onto something if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.660]   It's like I want to move or like some people.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.900]   You can start to identify ways in which you suddenly
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.540]   have this positive energy.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.180]   It's not a fear energy.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.580]   It's almost like a magnetism to things.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.060]   And just don't be confused or misdirected
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.180]   in thinking that it's that thing.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:11.380]   It's that, again, energy or that attraction to something
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:16.340]   that feels right that is your, I wish we had these divining
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.140]   rod to find water.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.420]   That's your tool.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.820]   It's like antennae.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.680]   You want to grow your antennae.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.940]   So how do you follow your dreams?
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.140]   Well, I never thought I'd do a podcast.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.220]   I never thought I'd become a neuroscientist.
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.580]   You have to be willing, of course, to take risks
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:39.120]   and to iterate quickly but not so quickly that you fail out
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.780]   of the game, et cetera, if you do get back in, et cetera.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.500]   But it's really about developing an awareness.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.100]   Now, the key thing is you're not going to find this by going up
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.900]   a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.220]   to just kind of rock it.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.060]   Does this sort of piano fall onto your head?
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.480]   It's not going to happen that way.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.140]   You have to interact with the sensory world
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.740]   and different kinds of people.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.620]   And you have to be a little bit of an adventurer
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.140]   in a safe way, of course, an adventurer,
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.760]   and learn to recognize the signals.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.260]   And some people are very in tune with this.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.660]   There's an amazing podcast with Rick Rubin recently
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.800]   on Joe Rogan's podcast where he talks
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.220]   about the creative processes.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.580]   It seems like whatever is going on in that beard of his
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.740]   just connects to the world.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.540]   And he can just, like, there.
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.420]   That's where you need to go.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.560]   But that's part of the magic is you don't really know.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.460]   And because it's all energetic.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.980]   It's all energetic.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.400]   And when I say energetic, I don't
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.320]   mean in the mystical sense.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.700]   I mean you have to learn to sense
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.020]   those fluctuations in energy.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.080]   Some people can sense them very easily
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.020]   because they're very mellow.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.780]   And if something gets them really excited,
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.720]   they notice, as a big delta, as we say in science, big change.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.180]   Other people, they ride kind of high all the time.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.960]   And so everything is exciting to them.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.300]   And they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.140]   in what's really special and right for them.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:04.220]   In fact, mania is characterized by hyper-elevated levels
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:04.780]   of dopamine.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.200]   And everything is a good idea.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.820]   And depression is the opposite.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.260]   Nothing is a good idea.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.140]   Nothing is going to work.
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.540]   And those are the extremes.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.920]   And those are rough conditions, obviously.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.020]   But for most people, it's about learning
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.940]   to detect those subtle fluctuations.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.260]   And every time, every single time,
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.300]   you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.380]   and doing well in life.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.880]   There are a lot of people who are exceptional at their craft,
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.740]   but not necessarily doing well on the whole.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.300]   Those people have a kind of intuition
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.100]   about what feels good to them.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.900]   This year's Nobel Prize winner in chemistry
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.940]   is my colleague Carolyn Bertosi.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.660]   And all I know of her, except the fact
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.740]   that she's an amazing chemist, is
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.160]   they did this interview with her.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   And she said that when everyone would go out in college,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.060]   she was finding excuses to stay home and read
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.300]   organic chemistry.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.820]   Now that, to me, sounds like a bad night.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.860]   But for her, it was pure delight.
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.980]   And she's wired for that.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.300]   And I think her work is going to be
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.020]   vitally important and transformative for humanity.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.980]   I really do.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:14.420]   So how do you succeed in chasing your dreams?
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.120]   You succeed in identifying what they are,
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.500]   but you don't know at the outset.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:23.780]   You want to find the energy to find the right path
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.580]   be off your path.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:29.940]   That's essentially what I've done.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.380]   I still look for the feeling of delighting
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.300]   in Costello or the cuttlefish.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.580]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.180]   It's not a template I have to match, but that's my like,
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.780]   oh, yeah, I know what that feels like.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.780]   It's like a texture.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.200]   It's like if you think about a bunch of different textures
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.940]   of sandpaper, it's like this one that just feels really good.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.740]   And so you're comparing everything to that.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.060]   Because the system that involves all these chemicals,
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.820]   you'll find it if you learn to pay attention to it.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.660]   But you won't find it sitting, staring at your belly button,
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.020]   or going up a mountain.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:04.520]   You have to be in sensory experience in order to find it.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.820]   Reflection is good, but you need to get into action.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.780]   OK, well, all right.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.880]   Well, OK, so psilocybin, opinion of the psychedelics generally.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.260]   We just had an episode with my colleague, Nolan Williams,
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.940]   who's a triple board certified neurologist, psychiatrist.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.300]   This is a fun thing about working at Stanford.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.380]   It's also very humbling because you're like, whoa,
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.380]   who are these people?
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.140]   Got three board certifications.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.980]   You know, the psilocybin, first of all, not for everybody,
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.260]   people with psychosis.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:35.600]   It is still illegal, decriminalize certain places.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.360]   So obviously, cautionary notes, people
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.180]   who have drug addiction issues or other kinds of addiction
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.640]   issues need to be thoughtful about diving
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.480]   into a neurochemical landscape like that.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:52.280]   But it does appear that the clinical trials on one
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.320]   macro dose-- this is what's interesting to me.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.740]   A lot of people talk about microdosing psilocybin.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.640]   But the data, at least according to Matthew Johnson, who
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.880]   is also on the podcast, the data for microdosing
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.520]   are not really there, frankly.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.220]   The data on single session macrodose,
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.640]   the sort of heroic doses that have been talked about
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:16.940]   in the psychonaut community for depression and, to some extent,
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:23.060]   PTSD, and for eating disorders, and for end of life preparation
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.300]   are quite encouraging.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.140]   In fact, the current data suggests
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.780]   that about 2/3 of people achieve lasting relief from one
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.720]   session.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.660]   Now, keep in mind, those are guided sessions
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.200]   with physicians in the room, et cetera.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.760]   I do think there's a potential hazard of all psychedelics,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.120]   which is they alter--
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.320]   this includes MDMA, or especially MDMA.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.540]   They alter the chemical landscape in you
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.280]   such that a lot of things can serve
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.240]   as attractors in that state, meaning
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.200]   you can get really into the sound of music in an MDMA
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.360]   session, feel connected to that, and waste the opportunity
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   for some more meaningful transformative rewiring.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.880]   And I do think that that's worth paying attention to.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.480]   So that's the usefulness of having a therapeutic guide
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.200]   there, is they can continually steer you
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:16.080]   back to what, at least for you, is the more meaningful work.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.720]   But it's very encouraging.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.980]   And Nolan Williams, who I trust--
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.600]   he's, again, triple board certified MD--
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.240]   said that in the studies of lifetime perceived individual
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.860]   and societal risk of all the compounds
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.200]   out there, except for caffeine, psilocybin
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.140]   is at the bottom of the list, whereas things
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.200]   like heroin, cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.840]   sit at the top of the list.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.400]   Actually, alcohol quite high on that list
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.320]   at certain amounts of consumption.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.580]   So I'm very excited about what's happening
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.440]   in the landscape of psilocybin, but I'm not
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.920]   so excited about the microdosing data.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.240]   Very excited about the single heroic dose data.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.560]   One interesting thing there, perhaps,
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.180]   what seems to be the unifying feature
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.900]   of a successful psilocybin session,
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.580]   is that at some point, the person feels
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.540]   as if it's too much of an autonomic thing.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.080]   They kind of get to this point, and then they
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.860]   are encouraged to, quote unquote, "let go."
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.020]   And I'm fascinated by this concept of letting go,
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.600]   because I'm a neuroscientist.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.520]   We don't know what that means.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.560]   But it seems like being able to ride
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.200]   the wave of autonomic arousal from top to bottom
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.400]   seems to be very powerful for trauma and depression
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:31.680]   treatment.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.720]   And this is interesting.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.160]   A lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.240]   nowadays is we're stressed about a lot of things,
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.840]   but we never actually get to go into the full stress response
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.040]   and then let it relax again.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.400]   And catharsis was big at one point.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   Scream therapy, Steve Jobs is really into scream therapy.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.280]   Whether or not catharsis is healthy or not
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   has been debated, but the data are kind of pointing to the fact
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.820]   that it may be provided that the catharsis is not obviously
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.560]   someone damaging themselves or somebody else.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.440]   So maybe I should all be screaming a lot more.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.880]   Why does my desire to eat disappear
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.800]   after I use the sauna?
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.500]   Oh, interesting.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.940]   I can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.720]   I can only speculate.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.760]   The sauna or any kind of deliberate heat
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.320]   exposure that's uncomfortable releases this molecule
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.400]   dynorphin.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.360]   This is actually the same molecule that's
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.280]   released under conditions of alcohol withdrawal.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.360]   Makes you feel agitated and not good.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.280]   And then there's this rebound.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.400]   The way it feels good is later it
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.640]   causes this upregulation in the so-called mu-opioid receptors.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.800]   So the chemicals that you have, your so-called endogenous
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.160]   opioids, not the opioids that relate to the opioid crisis,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.000]   but the ones that you naturally make
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.720]   are able to have a more robust effect after the sauna.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.120]   Dynorphin is an appetite suppressant.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.520]   And for reasons related to kind of general discomfort
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.440]   in the body.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.280]   So that's the only reason I can speculate.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.660]   There are a number of other things
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.320]   that sauna does, including massive increases in growth
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.200]   hormone, provided you don't sauna too much.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.800]   So if you do it once a week for four 20-minute sessions spaced
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.200]   five minutes apart, you get these enormous increases
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:18.960]   in growth hormone.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.600]   If you start doing it more often,
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.320]   you get still significant but smaller increases
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.740]   in growth hormone.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.840]   And my team-- this is how the podcast goes, too.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.920]   At some point, Rob just goes, it's enough.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.000]   So if you think that the episodes are long now,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.200]   they'd be a lot longer.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   Listen, I just want to--
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.360]   before we part, I know it's Sunday night
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.500]   and people have to go.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.820]   I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.840]   I know that, at least for me, I'm
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.540]   still sort of baffled, but pleasantly so,
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.660]   that people are interested in investing time to come out
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:55.640]   and hear hours of a nerd like me talk about science and tools.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.280]   And I'm delighted that people are hopefully
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.800]   gleaning some useful information.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.480]   Please do pass along the information.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.480]   I didn't invent this stuff, as I mentioned before.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.160]   I was not consulted to the design phase.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.600]   I have no domain over it.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.440]   This is the stuff of Mother Nature.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.340]   Whatever other beliefs you have, they're here in Austin.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.040]   Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't finish by saying,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.080]   have a wonderful night and thank you
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.280]   for your interest in science.
