[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.060]   One trick that I like to use, and it saved me probably at least a few hundred dollars, if not more, is use an app that automatically adds all of your card length offers to your cards.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.720]   So the wild thing is there might be an offer on your Amex, U.S. Bank, Bank of America card that you just haven't activated.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.020]   Even if you go spend money at the merchant that there is an offer and you haven't activated the offer, you won't get the cash back or the bonus points.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.520]   And so I really like an app called Card Pointers, or there's a new one I think SaveWise is also offering this service.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.320]   And there's an app called Max Rewards that for kind of security reasons, I can't endorse that app right now, though I know lots of people that have had a good experience.
