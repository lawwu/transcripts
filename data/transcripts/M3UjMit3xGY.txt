[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   All right, everybody, welcome to 2023. Everybody's well rested
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.080]   and ready to take on 2023. Yes, tomorrow. Amazing. Okay, sexy
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.120]   poo. I know you don't go to temperatures that are under 57
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.360]   degrees anymore. Have a nice break. Did you go somewhere
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   warm? Yes. Okay, that's a confirmation. Wow, man, so many
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.120]   words. And freeberg. I'm over cold weather vacations. Yeah,
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.320]   that does happen at a certain point. I actually went to
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.800]   Florida went to the free state of Florida. Oh, really?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   Yes. What's going on in Florida at the turn of the new year? I
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.280]   wonder that drew you down to the great state of Florida.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.880]   We're just freeing it up in the free state of Florida.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.320]   Rain Man David
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   We have our 2023 predictions now, play some music and all
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.920]   that kind of stuff. Producer Nick at this point. Let's get to
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.920]   it. Last year, we did. Do you guys notice that every time we
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   talk about something somewhere between sort of two months to a
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920]   year later, the Wall Street Journal ends up writing a big
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.640]   piece about it. Think piece about it. Yeah. So I tweeted
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.400]   into the group chat, like last year, we all talked about
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   sequoia and distributing public equities and how it's very
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.560]   fraught and difficult. And then today, they write this big
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.040]   article about how people have just burned enormous amounts of
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.320]   billions of dollars that they could have returned to LPS like
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   these venture investors by not distributing.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560]   Makes sense.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   Three weeks ago, when we did our end of the year wrap up, my big
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.000]   winner for 2022 were the pot shops, right Citadel. And today
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.520]   in Wall Street Journal, an article lands that these guys
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.640]   with 56 billion of aum over the last two years have made almost
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.160]   $45 billion of revenues. Isn't that incredible?
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   And this is what happens to math.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640]   Usually, they are, these guys are just crushing in and Citadel
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.320]   securities did like almost, you know, seven and a half billion
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.040]   of revenue. I mean, it's unbelievable these businesses
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   how good they are. Yes. So let's get into this is typical.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   Chamath. If you think about journalists, they're trying to
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.400]   get into the conversations that are occurring at the bar after
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.800]   the event, the late night conversation, the group chats
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.320]   will and that's what this podcast is. It's the exposed
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560]   back channel, right. And so if you listen to this pod, you got
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.920]   the back channel of Silicon Valley, politics, tech, science,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.480]   etc. So let's do our predictions. In 2020, we said
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.360]   our biggest political winner would be sacks. And I both said
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.240]   to Santa's Chamath says you should bang and freeberg said
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   Putin, who do we think is our biggest political winner going
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.800]   forward? Who do you pick sacks biggest political winner for
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.400]   2023? Who will be your biggest political winner for 2023?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   Well, I went a little bit outside the box here, because I
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   think we're gonna have gridlock in Washington. So not expecting
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   a ton to be coming out of Washington over the next year.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.800]   My pick for biggest political winner is Asian American college
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.080]   applicants. There are two Supreme Court decisions that the
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.480]   court heard on Halloween last year, there was a lawsuit
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.640]   against Harvard and a another lawsuit against UNC by a group
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.560]   called students for fair admissions, and that they
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   maintain that Harvard and UNC violate Title Six, the Civil
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.720]   Rights Act, because Asian American applicants are far less
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.000]   likely to be admitted than similarly qualified applicants
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.440]   from other groups. And the federal courts in Boston and
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.960]   North Carolina rejected this argument, but the Supreme Court
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.800]   took up the cases. So they kind of went out of their way to hear
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.840]   this. And I think that they are going to, they're going to
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.640]   file a primitive action, I think the majority will rule to strike
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   down these policies that really discriminate against Asian
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.120]   Americans. And I think they're the last group in America where
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.200]   it seems to be okay to discriminate against and I think
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.040]   the Supreme Court is gonna is gonna find that unconstitutional.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   To my offended thoughts there, you have brought this up
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.000]   multiple times on the podcast over the last two years.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.400]   I have said that this was unfortunately, affirmative
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.760]   action when it started, I think had very, very good intentions.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.320]   And I still think that there's a place for it. The problem is
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.800]   that these very liberal institutions decided to play
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.120]   judge, jury and executioner on which minorities counted in
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.520]   affirmative action. And that's not what the intention was. The
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.160]   intention was to look at the establishment and their ability
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.080]   to get their progeny into these incredible schools, even when
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.680]   they didn't deserve to be there. And so I think this was always
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.600]   an issue of classism that was disguised as racism. And people
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.720]   who are in the upper classes of society have always had an edge.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.800]   You had the legacy admissions into Harvard, you had people,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.480]   the Kushner's very famously right, like the $5 million check
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.960]   from the father that got the son into the school, all of this
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   stuff, it's, it's been well written about. And whether or
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.560]   not those things are right, isn't the point. I think the
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.760]   point is that there are folks in emerging, lower middle classes,
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.560]   who have the potential to crush. And those kids should have a
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   chance. And you can't just decide who those kids are based
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.480]   on the color of their skin. And in this case, what happened was
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.200]   some blacks were still allowed in some Hispanics were allowed
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.480]   in, but Asian Americans broadly were discriminated. And that was
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.760]   a really stupid outcome. You cannot punish kids for willing
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.200]   to work their ass off. And I think that that was the
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.600]   unfortunate outcome of what affirmative action has become by
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   2022. So it is going to get repealed. The reason it's going
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   to get repealed is that, you know, we have case law that very
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.080]   clearly states that any institution that accepts federal
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.520]   funds cannot have any form of discrimination. And this is how
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.360]   these folks who have tried to repeal affirmative action have
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.080]   taken up this lawsuit. And hopefully, the outcome is a more
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.800]   meritocratic system that also tries to create a plurality of
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.240]   different people from different backgrounds, free bargaining
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.480]   thoughts. And if not your biggest political winner for
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   2023, my biggest political winner for 2023 is MBS Mohammed
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.880]   bin Salman, I think that Saudi Arabia will have the most
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.680]   important year in kind of the modern era in terms of their
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.280]   role. I don't know if you guys saw this Reuters report from a
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.920]   few weeks ago, but there's kind of a deepening discussion about
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.120]   the oil yuan trade, in that Saudi would sell oil to China
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.640]   and they would get paid in one Saudi Arabia sits at the
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.800]   intersection of the United States, Russia and China, they
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   have relationships with all three nations. And in the kind
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.400]   of conflict and power struggle that is underway, I think that
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.760]   ultimately, the direction of where global currency kind of
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.600]   reserves will be taken, and the importance of these great
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.240]   nations and who sits atop whom can actually be dictated and
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.280]   significantly influenced by MBS this year, by some of the deals
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.880]   and trades he might put in place and the and the kind of
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   partnerships he might forge, I think as a result, you will see
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.160]   him kind of rise in terms of influence, not in terms of, you
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   know, hey, the world has accolades for this for this guy.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.280]   But I think in terms of global influence, he will rocket ship
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.160]   to kind of the top because of this, this kind of jockeying he
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.600]   can now do between these three great nation states and
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.080]   defining, you know, what's going to happen with the US and
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.280]   what's going to happen with China and what's going to
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.240]   happen, great selection of currency reserves, great
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.120]   selection. I mean, great selection.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.040]   The shitty thing, by the way, about your selection is that
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.160]   Biden, our explicit stance is unfortunately, quite
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.920]   confrontational with MBS. And yeah, you saw that play out in
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   q4. We asked them to ease up on OPEC plus to introduce supply
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.840]   cuts, and they did some nominal 100,000 barrel per day cut
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.400]   didn't do much of anything. There was an article to your
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.920]   point freeberg just recently about Saudi really doubling down
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.040]   on getting the oil out of the ground and monetizing their
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.800]   petrochemicals. So there's just going to be a glut of supply in
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.240]   the market. And we have the least amount of influence with
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.320]   Saudi Arabia than we've ever had. And it seems like we could
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.480]   change that if we decided to, but I think Biden has taken this
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.160]   very confrontational approach, which doesn't seem to make and
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.480]   remember a lot of sense.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   Their stated intent is to diversify away from oil, and
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.120]   into technology and other kind of emerging growth economies.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.920]   That's why they funded the vision fund. That's why MBS made
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   that big kind of visit to Silicon Valley a few years ago.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.520]   And there is technology that they want to import into Saudi
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.560]   Arabia, and they want to have ownership in around the world.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.280]   And if the US is creating a barrier for them to import us
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.640]   tech into Saudi or for Saudi to kind of invest in the US, but
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.440]   China and Russia have open arms, and all they want is for Saudi
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   to start doing trades in yuan, it's going to happen. And I
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.440]   think that's where this guy has kind of a real opportunity to
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.240]   shift the global economic dynamic,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   say what you will about Trump, he had open dialogue with North
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.920]   Korea, China, Russia, and the enemies close, sure want to be
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.720]   able to talk to anybody, and he was able to talk to anybody. Now
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.640]   you also want to be able to say, Hey, listen, you can't dismember
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.000]   a journalist like Khashoggi, and you need to be able to have both
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.320]   of those ideas in your head. You can't be rigid in foreign
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.920]   policy, you have to be fluid, and keep people at the table
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.560]   talking to math, who is your big political? Who do you predict
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.320]   will be the big political winner of 2023? Chamath's prediction,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   everybody, go ahead.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.960]   I really like spread trades, right? Where you go long
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.520]   something and short another. So I'd like to pair my biggest
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   political winner with my biggest political loser for 2023. Okay.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.120]   And I am going to focus on the Republican nomination. And I am
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.920]   going to go long. Nikki Haley, and I'm going to go short. Ron
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.160]   DeSantis. Now let me
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.600]   sacks again, if you if you're watching, you're not watching
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.480]   sacks right now, he is ready to interject, go to Martha.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.840]   So I think that all of this nonsense, for example, in the
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.360]   house speaker race, all of the midterm results, what it really
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.840]   speaks to our people are getting exhausted with the lunatic
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.120]   fringes of both parties. That's point number one. And point so
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.880]   that favors moderates as an emergent class. And point number
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.800]   two is that if you look back through many, many cycles of
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.920]   Republican and Democratic nominations, it is a very
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   negative thing to be in the lead so early going into the Iowa
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.440]   caucuses in January. And so if you put those two things
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.080]   together, the risk is that DeSantis decays, things emerge,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.600]   people attack him because he's the clear front runner. And the
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.040]   opportunity just like it was for Trump in 16, or for Clinton, or
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.760]   for George Bush, not Herbert Walker, but you know, w is to
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.560]   emerge from the back. And so if I think about a moderate person
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.880]   who can emerge from the back, who can consolidate the ranks,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.520]   they should probably be from the south, they will have a lot of
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.960]   these purple compromises that sacks mentioned in their policy
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:02.280]   program. And they will have a history of winning and a history
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.240]   of normalcy. And so I think that of all of the places where you
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.680]   could ever elect a woman as President of the United States,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.840]   I think it will come from the Republicans before it comes from
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.040]   the Democrats. I mean, the Democrats are, unfortunately,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   increasingly judgmental. And I think it's very difficult for a
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.240]   woman to emerge there. But I do think that Nikki Haley has a
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.000]   shot. So I'm going to go long Nikki Haley. And I'm going to
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.400]   short Ron DeSantis.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.720]   Okay, I like it a spread trade for his prediction. Well done
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.600]   before sacks you interject, let me just do mine. And because
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.520]   then you'll have to interject to I was looking at Biden and Trump
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   and thinking, hmm, which one of these is going to have the big
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.840]   win in 2023. So the two biggest I think, players, I have a
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.800]   prediction for Trump. I think he's going to lose 50 pounds on
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.960]   the Ozempic. Everybody loves a weight loss story. I think he is
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.800]   going to be indicted by Garland. Is he on? Wait a minute. Sorry.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.520]   He's on Ozempic. No, I'm predicting an Ozempic run.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.000]   And he's going to drop 4050 pounds, then we're going to have
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.680]   a svelte Trump get indicted by Garland. And the debates and the
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.920]   and the and the rigmarole with DeSantis, I think he's gonna go
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.680]   after DeSantis based on weight and height. And then he's going
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.160]   to win the nomination in 24. And we're gonna have Trump versus
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.080]   Biden. But this is a crazy prediction here. I think we're
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.600]   going to have a settlement. I think he's going to agree to not
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.680]   run and get the pardon. This is a crazy prediction. I know. But
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   I think he loses the weight. He wins the nom. He gets indicted.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.120]   And then he gets the Richard Nixon pardon global pardon for
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.680]   all of the shit he's done. Saks you can reply to these two crazy
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.000]   predictions is right in mind.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.120]   I mean, this is like proof positive that everything you
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.160]   have to say about Trump is an act of projection. I mean, like
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.960]   a zempik. Are you talking about yourself or Trump?
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.000]   Strike. Boom.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   My journey has been a zempik and super good. Yes. Both of those
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.920]   things. Have you Saks done any of them?
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.400]   Yeah, I've tried it.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.240]   Yeah. I think everybody should be looking into this if you're
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.520]   have weight issues. It's a it's a it's a great new
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.120]   I would say it even more broadly. I've been reading a lot
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   about these GLP ones. And I gotta tell you, statins are a
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   clear wonder drug. Yes. Okay. I think the the 50 year
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:35.560]   longitudinal data on its value is pretty unimpeachable. Metformin
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.720]   even taken prophylactically has shown incredible benefits for
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.960]   cell regeneration, longevity, and glucose management. And the
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   real look, the reality is, let's just take a step back the
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.120]   American diet, we're all pre diabetic. Okay, so let's just
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.600]   let's just not beat around the bush, the way that Americans eat
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.440]   and our food supply and also probably in Western Europe is
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.600]   pre diabetic by definition, it's shit, it's trash. So metformin
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.680]   makes a lot of sense. And again, it's longitude data is
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.160]   incredible. But I got to tell you, the early data on these GLP
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.840]   ones are unbelievable. It's extraordinary. And I can tell
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.080]   you, first hand experience, I would lose half a pound a week
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.000]   when I would diet. No, but what I'm saying is, it's beyond that
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.920]   I'm what I'm talking about is insulin response. It's cardiac
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.240]   health. And so if this data tracks like this, man, you just
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.680]   want to put everybody on these GLP. I just want to also put a
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.880]   disclaimer out here, do your own research, work with your doctors,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.560]   whether it's for metformin or as epic, but I had great results on
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   it. I recommend if you're struggling with weight loss,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.520]   like I did for many years, you talk to your doctor about it.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.640]   That said, it's not a commercial for what Govia or Zempik, but I
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.920]   do think these things are going to change the world jarra. Well,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.520]   and they're getting better. And it seems like diet, people with
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.640]   diabetes are on them for life. So if your question is like, if
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.080]   I could do this for a year to lose weight, you know, I think
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.480]   diabetics are on it for life. So when I made my decision, again,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.520]   work with your doctors, not random podcast or venture
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.600]   capitalists for your health advice. I was like, well, all of
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.760]   these people who have diabetes are going to audit for years
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.080]   unless it's non toxic, go get a prenuvo scan. Just make sure
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.840]   absolutely you got. So there you have it. There's our
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.760]   predictions. So I want to respond to any of this. I want
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.640]   to I want the sacks to react to my spread.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   Trade. Yeah. So look, I think, you know, if you're going on a
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.400]   betting site, I think that you could place that bet that
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.880]   Chamath made pretty cheaply. And probably it's like has some
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.680]   good upside to it. So I don't criticize it as a bet. Do I
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.520]   think it's actually going to happen? No. And I think the
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.720]   reason is, is this that if you look at what's happening right
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.200]   now with the speaker's race, there's two very clear wings in
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   the Republican Party, there's establishment wing, and then
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.560]   there's kind of this populist MAGA wing. And the candidate,
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.720]   whoever it is, in 24 needs to unite those two wings. And I
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.200]   think this is really the best argument for DeSantis is he's
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.400]   widely accepted by both. I think Nikki Haley's problem is that
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.880]   she's very well regarded within the establishment wing of the
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.960]   Republican Party, but she has no meaningful support within the
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.280]   populist wing. And so I don't think she's capable of bringing
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   the party together, at least at this point in time, she would
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.520]   have to prove let's call it populist bona fides that she
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.880]   just doesn't have right now. So this is why I think you know,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.080]   DeSantis, he does have front runner risk, you're right that
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.840]   people are going to keep taking shots of them, as long as he's
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   a front runner, but all right, let's
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.960]   he's capable of he's capable of uniting the party in a way that
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   it desperately needs right now, as we're seeing with the Kevin
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   McCarthy thing playing out.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.240]   Yeah. Okay, let's go for our biggest losers. We'll rip
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.800]   through this last year, I said Biden and Trump and the
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.760]   extremes. Chamath said the progressive left again, the
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.960]   extreme SAC said Pelosi, who just wrapped up her tenure and
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   Freeberg said US influence globally was the biggest
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.480]   political loser. Let's get our predictions for the biggest
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.920]   political loser of 2023. Freeberg, who do you think will
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.080]   be the biggest political loser of 2023? The world wants to know
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.480]   freeberg?
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   I would continue my US influence, but I am going to
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.680]   shift. Here's what I think is going to happen this year. My
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.240]   big prediction is based on I think the world has too much
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.760]   debt. I think that the economic slowdown coupled with rising
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.080]   interest rates globally and a dearth of kind of asset capital
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.840]   inflows means that there's going to be a lot of issues with a
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.440]   number of debt markets around the world, particularly kind of
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.800]   emerging sovereign debt. Just to give you guys a sense global
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.560]   debt is about $235 trillion in public and private. You know,
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.040]   that's somewhere between five and $15 trillion of interest
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.440]   payments a year, depending on what the net rate is on $96
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.800]   trillion global GDP. And there's another trillion and a half of
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.780]   unfunded liabilities in the US and pensions and Social Security
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.180]   and all this other stuff. I think this is the year where a
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.360]   lot of the debt markets start to unravel. The freeberg is a
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.840]   entity that steps in or a political loser. I'm going to
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.160]   tell it one second. Political Yeah, so the political
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.480]   ramifications. So the political ramifications for me, I think
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.040]   that the the entity that steps in to try and support these
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.520]   unwinding moments is the IMF. And I think that no matter what
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.280]   the IMF does, they're going to look bad. I think that the you
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.080]   know, it's sort of like like Jerome Powell this this past
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.980]   year, right? Like you raised rates too late, you raise rates
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.180]   too quickly, no matter what you do, it has some adverse effect
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.020]   and impact. It's either inflationary, or it impacts
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.100]   growth. And so I think the IMF is going to get a lot of heat
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.980]   for either acting not too soon, or sorry, not fast enough or, or
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.980]   acting too aggressively and causing inflation as a bunch of
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.620]   these markets face credit risk this year. So my big bet is the
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.660]   IMF is going to play a major role. And we're going to be
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.420]   talking a lot about the IMF later this year. I think as a
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.340]   result, the IMF will get a lot of heat and you'll end up seeing
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.260]   a lot of pressure and political you know, just like we blame
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.300]   NATO, just like we blame Jerome Powell, and the Fed will end up
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.360]   blaming the IMF for a bunch of problems that will arise. But
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.800]   the natural physics of what's going on is the world has too
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.380]   much debt and not enough growth to cover the debt, the cost of
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.420]   debt. That's it. Okay, and the IMF will be the political kind
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.720]   of, you know, hit that'll that'll result. A point of view,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.920]   but I think, yeah.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.040]   And who do you have, as your biggest political loser
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.760]   prediction for 2023? Mr. David Sachs?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.560]   Well, I mean, Kevin McCarthy may not survive the week. So let me
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   go in a different direction. I think California is my big
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.280]   political loser. And I would say in particular, the city of San
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.040]   Francisco, both are going to have gigantic budget shortfalls.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.520]   You may remember that this is back in 2021. When we had that
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.240]   asset bubble, California had a surplus of 76 billion. And then
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   insane. And then 2022 happened. And now the state is looking at
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.520]   a $24 billion deficit. Well, if we had taken say a third of that
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.880]   surplus from 21 and put it in a rainy day fund, we wouldn't have
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.080]   to worry about this deficit. But that was never done. Newsom
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.680]   started handing that money out like candy to the electorate to
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.000]   goose is election is reelect numbers and to get him past the
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.360]   that recall, remember, okay, so the state never got a fiscal
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.880]   outlook in order. And now I think it's going to be even
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:13.000]   worse in 2023. And San Francisco, the city, very
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.440]   similar kind of problem where its tax base is heavily
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.240]   dependent on commercial real estate, which is really
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.160]   suffering. So you know, the city of San Francisco in the state of
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.040]   California, they've moved their tax base to, to highly volatile
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.560]   capital gains. And with a really lousy stock market, I don't know
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.520]   how these guys gonna meet their budgets. So a lot of pain is
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.600]   going to be a lot of austerity and pain coming, that's for
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.560]   sure. And these people do not know how to manage a budget.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.120]   They're incompetent. So you say California freebirds as IMF,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.160]   Chamath, who do you think the biggest political loser for 2023
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.960]   will be already gave us your predictions. Right? Okay. And
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.800]   I'm in alignment with you. I think to send us peaked a little
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.840]   too early and the forever Trumpers and the in the chaos is
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.000]   going to be a little too much for him to handle. Okay, now we
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   get into what everybody wants business, business, business,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.280]   biggest business winner for 2023. Who do you have Chamath for
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.080]   your biggest business winner of 2023?
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.440]   I'm going to pick something out of my portfolio. I think I'm the
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.560]   only non trivially large investor in both SpaceX and
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.840]   relativity space. Relativity space has a huge SpaceX is
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.920]   clearly just crushing on all cylinders. And they're really
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.720]   the only game in town with respect to launch capability.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.920]   And if you just Google it, you'll see that the Europeans,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.400]   you know, have a hit or miss capability and launch, the
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.680]   Russians are completely unable to do launch now because of all
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.720]   of these sanctions. The private companies in New Zealand or the
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.760]   United States have also had fits and starts really incapable.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.680]   Relativity, which is really which is now the second most
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:02.040]   highly valued space business is about to do a launch in the
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.600]   third week of January. And the big difference between it and
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   SpaceX, which is sort of why we did it. This is a early YC
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.840]   company, I did the series A and kind of went along the whole
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.360]   way. They have 3d printed everything. And the reason why
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.960]   3d printing is interesting is you take a so if you if you
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.280]   think a rocket costs $5 billion, if built by NASA, Elon was able
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.360]   to take that to 100 to 500 million. And if you 3d print
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.760]   everything, you can take that cost to like five to 50 million.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.520]   And so it allows you to just have this repeatability and
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.440]   manufacturability. Now SpaceX also has a lot of 3d printed
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.360]   parts, but relativity is entirely 3d printed. It has a
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.400]   launch in three weeks at Cape Canaveral, I think. And we have
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   a like a $10 billion order book that gets unlocked. So I don't
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.520]   know how to see beyond a lot of these market forecasts right
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.960]   now. So I'd rather pick a company, I'll pick something in
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.680]   my portfolio. If the rocket does not blow up, there's a $10
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.720]   billion order book. And this company is now on a trajectory
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.200]   to be as valued as basic
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   as talking his book times two. And if it doesn't, it goes to
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.920]   zero. freeberg. Go ahead and talk your book times two or
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.120]   three. Let's see if you can one up Chama. Which one of your
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.520]   investments will be the biggest business winner of 2023 free
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:23.800]   Burke.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.960]   I'm not an investor. My big bet is open AI. It's just way too
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.760]   obvious to be anything else this year. As you guys know, there
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.880]   are dozens of startups that are being started right now, based
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   on an open AI demonstration of Dolly and chat GPT. I think
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.320]   we're seeing this in the enterprise and consumer markets.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.840]   I think open AI will become to some degree, maybe they could
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.960]   be as many paths they could take the AWS providing tooling and
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.560]   infrastructure to all these startups that are building
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.960]   applications for consumers and business users. Or they will end
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.840]   up doing a massive deal with Microsoft, I think it's
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.760]   inevitable, they're going to get a billion dollar plus investment
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.320]   this year, they could power, you know, AI driven Bing search and
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.160]   voice driven search. They could build their own products and
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.520]   their own tools. And they're becoming great investors, they
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.600]   invested in D script, which is a product company we use here for
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.720]   our podcast, which is an incredible product. And I think
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.120]   that Sam Altman is a very smart and shrewd investor as well. So
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.520]   for a lot of reasons, I think open AI could end up having an
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.600]   amazing year this year and a lot of different paths they could
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.360]   walk and we're going to come out of this year and say they're
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.800]   one of the top tech companies in the valley.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.760]   Okay, sacks. Open AI has, of course, increased your ability
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.160]   to talk to other humans. So you're seeing a lot of big wins
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:42.600]   there. I know. Is how do I talk to a child about their college
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.680]   hopes and aspirations?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.920]   No, no, no. How do I talk to a child about their day?
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   Literally his Hello,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.600]   Hello, progeny of mine. How are you faring today in this
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.560]   complicated?
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.720]   Write me a script of talking to a 12 year old about their hopes
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.360]   and dreams.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.160]   Say interesting using GPT for talking points on different
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.760]   topics.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   Okay, here we go.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.160]   On the GPT predictions.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.360]   That would be great.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.720]   These categories
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.840]   sacks as a person on the spectrum. Yeah, how delightful
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.880]   is this? chat GPT and you know, your treatment of your
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   condition?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.560]   That's great. Let me let me get to my answer here. So my answer
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.720]   for the big business winner of the year is America's natural
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.000]   gas industry. And I have to admit, this is an aspect of the
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.200]   Ukraine war that I didn't fully appreciate until I read this New
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.960]   York Times article the other day about how natural gas prices in
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.360]   Europe have now fallen to the level they're at before the war
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.920]   and everyone thought that there'd be this huge shortage,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.320]   and they wouldn't be able to heat their homes. Well, what
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   happened? The answer is that Europe completely cut off their
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.520]   dependence on Russian gas. And in fact, the Nord Stream
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.840]   pipelines were blown up. So physically, they separated, but
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   then on top of it, they basically started importing
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.160]   liquefied natural gas from the US. And here's the key paragraph
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.720]   in this article from the New York Times is that Europe
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.080]   rapidly built terminals to receive liquefied gas, sweeping
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.120]   away many of the usual bureaucratic obstacles, and
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.040]   environmental objections. So in other words, what would normally
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.920]   would have taken decades to get approvals, now was all put on a
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:36.600]   fast track. And Europe is now completely dependent on American
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.360]   natural gas. And I think this is the again, the thing maybe I
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.000]   underestimated the cold hard American interest in this war is
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.040]   to basically turn Europe into a vassal of America's natural gas
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.680]   industry. Previously, they were about to be dependent on Russia
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.640]   and Nord Stream was going to make that situation permanent.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.360]   We've, you know, somebody blew up Nord Stream. Now they're
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.200]   dependent on American LNG, they're going to pay higher
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.800]   prices for that. But it's, it's been a pretty impressive win for
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.520]   the American natural gas industry. And I think Biden has
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.280]   really pulled a 180 here. Because you remember when he
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   first came into office, he canceled Keystone, he canceled
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.880]   drilling, he was very tough on the oil and gas industry. I
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.320]   think after he then delivered the hundreds of billions for the
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.680]   climate, special interest in the Inflation Reduction Act,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.200]   now he's taking care of the oil and gas industry. I love it.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.680]   Here we go.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.520]   Yeah, not and so what you're saying is Biden dynamically
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.920]   changed course based on inputs like a great leader would. Okay,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.560]   well done.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.360]   Well, I don't I don't listen. I don't know. Well, no, listen, I
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.880]   think Biden has done something politically smart here. There's
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.480]   no question about it. I am giving him credit. Does it mean
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.560]   that this war was worth it? No, I don't. I don't think we should
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.360]   be engaging in oil wars like we did in the Middle East. So I'm
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.800]   not justifying this war. But I am saying that there is a cold
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.520]   hard American interest undergirding our position, which
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.360]   is, it's about LNG. It's not it's not just about moral
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.120]   platitudes.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.080]   Yeah, I mean, strong start to 2023. vassal and undergirding.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.760]   My biggest predictions I'm working backwards from to here,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.240]   I think the door dashes, Airbnbs, Ubers, Etsy's of the
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.600]   world who need entrepreneurs, they need workers, they need
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.160]   supply, they've always been supply constrained. As
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.560]   unemployment becomes, let's call it what it is sticky, you're
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.040]   going to see a lot more people participating in gig platforms
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.360]   or entrepreneurial platforms that enable them to make money.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.960]   So I think they will be huge beneficiaries, especially if
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.000]   they continue to lay off employees like DoorDash and
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.120]   Airbnb did to right size their businesses. But my first one, my
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.600]   number one is laid off tech workers. I think laid off tech
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.640]   workers who get together in groups of two, three or four
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.720]   developers, product managers, people who actually build stuff
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.680]   and start companies together are going to become extremely
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.320]   successful. And they're going to make incredible lemonade from
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.800]   these lemons of these big tech layoffs. So I think the startup
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.480]   space is again, and these laid off tech workers who choose to
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.960]   take control of the destiny and starts companies are going to be
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.280]   the true big winners. If you do it, do it with two or three
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.720]   friends, because you're going to need developers, you're going to
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.920]   need those those talented people in the startups that have three
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.800]   founders get funded faster than the ones with one. So those are
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.400]   my two winners. All right. Oh, yeah. And last year, our biggest
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.520]   business winners were Chamath said SMBs, Saks said rise to the
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.200]   rest, freeberg said stripe. And I said Disney Millennials and
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.480]   Gen Z. Let's go on to biggest business loser for 2023.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.160]   Friedberg, who do you think will be the biggest business loser in
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.880]   23 this year? In fact,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.920]   okay, so my biggest loser is the general category of capital
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.560]   intensive series B through D growth businesses in the startup
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.000]   landscape private companies. As you guys know, there's been a
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.640]   big shift in capital allocation. A lot of the folks who were
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.800]   writing big checks into growth rounds are retreating back to
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.360]   writing smaller checks and seed and a rounds they don't want to
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.120]   write the $20 million Series B, they want to write the $5
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.440]   million seed in a round. No one wants to kind of follow the
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.040]   valuation. No one wants to set the valuation for these growth
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.480]   businesses. Particularly if after this round, you know, you
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.000]   need another big round of capital, and no one's sure if
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.640]   someone's going to be waiting on the other end. As a result, we're
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.360]   seeing tons of these businesses run into capital infusion walls,
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.040]   they can't pivot. I think we'll see what we saw in the.com
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.720]   bubble, where 99 and a half percent of these companies
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.520]   actually die, the half percent that we are going to emerge as
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.680]   the next $100 billion enterprises, the Googles and the
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.080]   Amazons of the world. So there will be light at the end of the
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.680]   tunnel for the winners. But generally, there are hundreds of
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.960]   companies in hardware, in sin bio in biotech and high growth
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.400]   enterprise software that require significant sales investment
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.960]   expense. A lot of these businesses where the capital
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.680]   intensive nature of the business just doesn't have the market for
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.280]   it right now. And investors are all retreating, and they're
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.560]   going to be selective. So that's where I think there's gonna be
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.160]   more capital intensive. By the way, seed seed and a investing
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.120]   hot as a button. B just kiss. That's what that Yeah, that's
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.560]   it. Okay, sacks biggest business loser for 2023.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.920]   Well, I just by the way, 100% agree with what free work said,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.880]   but my biggest loser for business in 23 is the consumer.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.400]   I just don't understand how the consumer isn't going to finally
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   tap out in this economy. I mean, they have a mountain of personal
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.600]   debt, credit card debts at all time highs. I think the average
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   credit card rate hit 19.6% last week, and is expected to rise
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.240]   even further. The mortgage rates are above 7% now. So forget
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   about trying to buy a new home, or sell your home and your stock
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.880]   portfolio is down to and now layoffs are starting to pile up.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.280]   So I just don't understand how we're going to avoid a
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.680]   recession. And you saw you know, cash car he's saying that the
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.360]   Fed's gonna keep raising 5.4% his prediction. You know, I
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.320]   don't understand how if rates are at five and a half percent,
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.960]   that doesn't finally break the back of this economy. And we go
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.200]   into a recession. So you think sacks that the economy is
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.160]   actually broken right now, we just don't have the data because
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.280]   the data lag 60 days in most people's minds, because it does
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.520]   feel like the consumer is just and real estate has just broken
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.760]   at this very moment. It seems like I mean, the pain is very
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.360]   unequal, right. But in the tech industry, we've been in a
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.200]   recession for a year. I mean, like the growth stocks are down
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.160]   80%. But freeberg said is true. No one's going to fund these,
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.760]   you know, high burning companies, there's an enormous
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.920]   amount of retooling that has to happen. Look, I think the
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.040]   recession is here. It's just very unequally distributed,
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.360]   distributed. Exactly.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   Yeah. Well, I mean, if you look at it, buy now pay later, that's
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.640]   a category starting to break credit card debt, as you're
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:52.080]   saying, hitting, you know, big, bad records in terms of how much
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.520]   we love spending. Also, people's savings are going down. So the
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.680]   consumers back has been broken. I think we're just going to feel
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.000]   it in the in the first and second quarter. Chamath, who's
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.480]   your biggest business loser prediction for 2023? The world
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.000]   wants to know,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   let me just build on what freeberg and sack said for a
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.960]   second before I give you my pick. Sure. I this is the
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.640]   conversation you and I had when we just got on guys, what I was
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.240]   telling J Cal is at the end of q4, I did five deals. And four
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.040]   were pro radios, one was a new deal. And they were all clean
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   markups. So the four deals that other people put money into. And
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.840]   I was looking at them, and I was trying to figure out, okay, what
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.040]   differentiates these things and freebird to your point, these
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.600]   were super clean startups with very clean cap tables that had
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.080]   clear progress. And then conversely, I had seven converts
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.840]   showed to me for companies whose valuations were anywhere between
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.280]   three, and I would say 12 billion. And I did none of them.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.240]   And not only did I do none of them, nobody else did any of
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.600]   them. And the problem was the real market clearing price was
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.960]   80 to 90% down. And so I was like, what is going on here? So
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.320]   freebird to your point, I don't even think it's just cash
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.680]   intensive startups. I think it's like all growth companies are in
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.040]   a really bad place. I thought that this growth stuff would get
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.200]   sorted out in two to three months. And now I'm worried it's
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.000]   two to three years. I think it's toxic, toxic.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.440]   Here's the definition of Chamath what I think has happened. And
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.320]   where I think the cutoff is, is when the value eight the
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.880]   implied market valuation of the company based on where public
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.240]   comps are trading is less than the total capital preference in
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   the company, the total preferred stock. Well, there's so many
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.840]   companies now that raised 400 million at 2 billion valuation,
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.200]   but the company is actually worth 300 million now, based on
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.080]   public market comps. So they're worth less than their preference
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.040]   stack. So how do you sort of do that?
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.400]   No, that this is why I think all these converts are getting done.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.960]   That's where the rubber meets the road on all these deals.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.480]   Yeah, that's right. Who does the convert benefit the convert
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:02.520]   benefits, the VCs who want to maintain the illusory valuation
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.040]   that they had before? They do that on the block. Yeah, they do
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.480]   that to assuage the limited partner who gave the money that
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.240]   the marks aren't as bad as they thought. But the people that
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.320]   really get screwed, as Jason said, are the common
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.000]   shareholders, because eventually those converts deals that do get
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.440]   done, those people will end up owning the company, the cap
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.240]   table gets completely flushed and reset. And the employees get
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.680]   wiped out.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.600]   Yeah. And then you got to basically take all the employees
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.480]   who were there previously, who now hate the founder, and you
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.320]   got to start over and give everybody all the other white,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.120]   the people to do all the work at fucked and the people do none of
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.680]   the work and who just want to maintain this shell game gets to
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.920]   basically live another day.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.760]   Basically, people are investing as you gave in the example
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.080]   earlier, like, hey, if it's a $3 billion company, but it's
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.400]   actually worth 750 people, instead of taking the valuation
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.240]   from 3 billion to 750, we'll say, okay, buy one share at the
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.080]   $3 billion price. And we'll give you three or four shares for
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   free or for a penny warrants, they're called typically, or,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   you know, just different ways to structure this. And then all of
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.240]   a sudden, nobody knows the actual denominator, they may own
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.600]   them 10,000 shares, but they don't know how many shares are
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   actually issued because the warrants are not on the cap
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.240]   table. They're in some side document in a folder in a lawyer
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   or CFO's office.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.720]   So let me let me tell you my biggest business loser. Yes,
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.200]   please.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.400]   I think that the biggest potential business loser this
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.200]   year is Google search, who has measured by stunner
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:34.320]   profitability, and engagement. I think it's easier for me to see
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:41.240]   where the the usage comes from, as opposed to picking open AI or
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.960]   chat GPT in terms of where the usage goes to. And the reason is
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.040]   because I think a lot of people don't still fully understand how
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.680]   machine learning and AI work, but just 30 second primer,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.360]   there's two big buckets of work. There's what's called learning,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.040]   which is how you learn how to make predictions. And then
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.160]   there's what's called inference, which is when you actually type
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.560]   something into the search box, you get the answer. The thing
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.160]   with learning, and what chat GPT is showing is that they have
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   learned by crawling the entirety of the web. There are five or
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.320]   six other organizations that are capable of crawling the entire
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.200]   web, in terms of cost in terms of compute in terms of the
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.480]   quality of the transformers and the quality of the AI. And so I
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:32.000]   find it easier to predict the decay in the quality of Google
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.560]   search as that much better than everybody else than I find it is
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.920]   to predict who will win because I think that with enough time
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.880]   and money, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, the Chinese internet
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.960]   companies can all compete Facebook. And so I think that
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.080]   you'll converge on the same training, which will lead to the
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.240]   same inference. And so I think consumers end up getting
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.160]   confused, and we'll end up being able to get high quality search
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.000]   results for many places versus today. You know, you wouldn't
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.360]   only think that Google is the only game in town, quite
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.280]   honestly, for most people. Well, I think that statistics show
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.200]   that Google could lose 10 or 15% of usage to all these other
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.800]   sites. And that may not make any of those sites that relevant,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.080]   but it'll have a material measurable impact to Google and
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   Google's fantastic prediction. And I think you know, chat,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.760]   GPT, or these other ones are going to have a very interesting
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.120]   marketing attack that they can do on Google is why search when
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.240]   you can get an answer, right? Hey, we'll just give you the
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.200]   answer. You don't have to search. I had so many losers
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.760]   that I went through here. I'm just gonna run backwards to
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.280]   them. Number five, I thought founders refused to downsize in
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.400]   2022 could be big losers in 2023.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.320]   How do you have five and the rest of us are just
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.560]   I'm just gonna tell you my thought process. I just don't
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.360]   want to have a long hair. Your thought number four, I thought
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.680]   VC funds founded in 2020. Then I thought crypto because Gary
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.920]   Gensler says it's all stock. Then I went with you. Chumot
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.800]   number four, Google, my god, they got so many headwinds
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.680]   against them with his chat GPT. But I wound up on white collar
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.640]   workers with no hard skills. Twitter going down to I think,
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.320]   you know, Elon said a couple 100 people's all you need to run
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.360]   Twitter. And I think he said he has 2000 employees or something
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.320]   like that. He has shown everybody, you know, hey,
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.720]   listen, these more can be done with less, or these things are
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.280]   overstaffed in a massive way. I think white collar workers now,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.520]   the idea that you're gonna have four offers and you're gonna be
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   able to play them off each other is over.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.880]   When we take the elites, elites,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.640]   sure. White collar workers, aka surplus elites, people who
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.240]   actually, you know, are mid managers who don't, who don't
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.400]   actually code or don't actually build a product or sell a
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.640]   product don't actually do real work. As I think many people
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.560]   would frame it in the managerial class or the CEO class, man,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.920]   they're gonna have a hard time. And this week, Andy, Amazon,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.640]   Andy cut 18,000 white collar workers, not the blue collar,
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.720]   the white collar workers in Amazon, that was a big turning
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.160]   point. And Benny off. You know, he's Ohana, he is Mahalo, he is
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.080]   Aloha, he does not like to lay people off. He considers
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.680]   Salesforce or family, he laid off 8000.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.760]   I predicted that.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.640]   Yeah. And I mean, that
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.400]   tweet about that. Well, I mean, the reason is pretty simple,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.000]   right? Their gross slowed down by two thirds of the most recent
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   quarter, but they're still spending the same amount of
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.440]   sales and marketing. So when that happens, your cap payback
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.120]   explodes, right? You go from three years payback to like 10
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.200]   years. So they have to cut costs in order to rationalize your
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.680]   unique economics. So and now it cascades, right? Because all of
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.320]   Salesforce's vendors are gonna be getting less money from
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.600]   Salesforce, because they're tightening their belts. So then
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.080]   those companies are gonna have to cut and the cycle just keeps
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.880]   going and going.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.640]   Right. And everybody tightens their belts at the same time,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.840]   freezes the economy, aka recession, and possibly worse.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.160]   So that mine was a surplus elite. So that's a nice little
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.840]   quartet. In 2022. Just so you know, I picked crypto freeberg
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.200]   also pick crypto, which must have used a MasterCard and SAC
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   said, assets classes that benefit from government dumps,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.800]   and publicity. Yeah. All right, let's go to biggest business
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.080]   deal of 2023. It's a prediction. What do we think could be the
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.800]   biggest business deal? Easy, easy. This one. Okay, come on.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.840]   Go. Let's go. Right here. Okay, come off quickly. Starlink will
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.520]   go public. Oh, SpaceX will cut and paste the cap table. And we
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.640]   will take yum, yum, it'll be yummy and delicious. And my
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.520]   prediction is that the Starlink valuation will be at least half
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.640]   of SpaceX is current private Marth 75 Billy, just five
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.680]   billion, it will be phenomenal. And I think the reason why is
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.920]   that I think in order for Elon to have complete financial
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.760]   flexibility and do what he needs to do, and, you know, he talked
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.520]   about this on our pod about the difficulties and the dangers of
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.920]   margin loans and all of that stuff. Yes, he's gonna create
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.320]   breathing room for himself. Ah, this is the simplest and most
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.640]   obvious way for him to do it. It'll give him a ton of more dry
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:59.200]   powder. Sure. So I think that this is an obvious outcome in
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.520]   2020. They already have a million subscribers in there
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.240]   better than nothing beta as they call it. I have two of them. I
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.280]   think this is a great, great. I was I was the first one to get
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.960]   it for for the global 7500. So okay, I got it for Yeah, yeah,
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.000]   similar. So there's my plate in your house in the same size.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.800]   Exactly. So there you go. There is a point people are
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.720]   underestimating the TAM I think of this product. The TAM is not
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.520]   existing broadband connections. It's second connections. It's
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.840]   connections where connections didn't exist. Just so you know,
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.240]   buses, the best in class, the best in class broadband
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.360]   connection for a plane is called k a band. And it costs 500 grand
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.520]   a year. That's ridiculous. And you can replace it for, you
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.280]   know, a 10th of a cost and Starlink on a plane is
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.760]   dramatically better by directionally. So I think
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.600]   Starlink is going to go public and I think it's going to be
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.320]   here. It's going to be the best chance that we have of opening
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.200]   up the capital markets in 2023.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.800]   There's another way of saying people who own private jets if
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.640]   they are flying 250 hours a year, which will probably be a
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.720]   reasonable number to 300 hours a year, they're paying $2,000 an
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.920]   hour for their internet service. That is bonkers. Okay, sax. Who
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.760]   is your big deal? biggest business deal prediction
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:25.520]   deals 23 prediction is there will be a deal between Putin and
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.000]   G. And they met by satellite late last week to discuss ways
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.400]   to further help each other in 2023. Putin characterized it as
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.520]   a no limits partnership. You may remember that the two of them
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.880]   inked a $175 billion gas deal in early February last year, that
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.440]   was three weeks before Putin invaded Ukraine. I think now
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.160]   Russia is even more dependent on China. We've really driven
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.840]   Russia into China's arms. And I think there will be a big deal
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.560]   not just on energy, but on agricultural products, mineral
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.840]   products, and rare earth minerals that, you know,
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.040]   Chamath likes to talk about, I think there could be a trillion
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.800]   dollar deal between Russia and China this year, if I was gonna
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.960]   go out and live and make prediction.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.440]   Okay, so there is your 2023 prediction of the biggest deal
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.840]   the Legion of dictators is forming. I do think it's it is
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   like, you know, that the axis of evil, this is more Legion of
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.760]   dictators, like, hey, let's do business together. Freeberg, you
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.840]   got a prediction for the biggest business deal of 2023. This is
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   really going out on a limb here.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.280]   I'll do two real quick. The first was the similar to what
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:40.040]   Zack said, but it's kind of echoing what I said earlier,
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.960]   which is the petro yuan trade. I think that's the Saudi China
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:49.800]   trade. If this happens, and oil is sold in yuan, it marks the
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:56.720]   beginning of I think, the end of the assumption that the US
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.560]   dollar is the global reserve and the risk free currency in
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.040]   reserve for the world. So I think the petro yuan trade, if
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.640]   you guys, here's the Reuters article covering G's visit to
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.520]   Saudi Arabia last month, first, second week of December. Once
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.720]   this gets inked, and signed, it's a real shift globally. I
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.520]   think the other one that I'm that I'm going to point out that
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.040]   I think is a bit of a out of left field one, maybe. And maybe
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.920]   I'm just gonna look like a total idiot at the end of the year.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.000]   But do a wildcard. I like it. This is my wildcard. So my
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.560]   wildcard is I think Apple ends up buying something completely
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.680]   out of the ordinary. And here's why I think Apple's core
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.800]   business, they're facing significant pressure with
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.440]   respect to their relationship and ties to China. As you guys
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.960]   may have seen last week, Foxconn announced that they're actually
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.360]   going further downstream in terms of their production model.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.920]   And they're trying to diversify away from being kind of the sole
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.000]   service provider to Apple. Apple, as you know, is under
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.800]   such pressure to get out of China, politically that they
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.680]   started to try and invigorate activity in Vietnam and
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.840]   elsewhere. So a lot of pressure on their relationship with their
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.960]   low cost producer and low cost production partner. They're also
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.120]   under a lot of political pressure because of the App Store
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.840]   revenues. You guys know this 30% App Store that they take, a lot
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.920]   of people are calling it monopolistic and antitrust is
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.040]   getting involved. So they're feeling that pressure. There's
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.800]   also the pressure with respect to the you know, waning consumer
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   demand for high end electronics Samsung last yesterday or last
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.120]   week, or yesterday, I think announced significant declines
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.240]   in consumer demand for electronics, or their forecast as
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.920]   such, that has to impact Apple as well. So when you put all of
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.320]   this together, right, they're, they're, they're being pressured
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.440]   to get out of their low cost manufacturing center, they're
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.960]   being pressured to stop making money on the App Store, they're
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.400]   being pressured, because the demand may be waning, they have
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.880]   to do something big to kind of diversify the business. So I
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.840]   think they might end up doing something like buying a real
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.000]   content company, maybe they do something like buy a Disney,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.760]   maybe they do something like buy an automotive company like Fiat
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.560]   Chrysler. I think there are a number of these kind of like
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.320]   what may seem today outrageous deals that Apple might end up
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.960]   kind of being pressured into doing so that they can get ahead
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.720]   of their forecast of the impact that all these pressures are
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.960]   going to have on their core business. And so I think this is
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.880]   something interesting to kind of think may happen this year. I
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.280]   certainly have no insight or Intel on anything or I could be
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.480]   completely wrong on this one. But it feels like they've got to
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.880]   do something this year. I'm going to keep that business
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.400]   growing. This is I think I love your wildcard because the MBS
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.440]   China trade and that relationship sure. Legion of
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.320]   dictators, but this one is really good. It's hard to buy
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.360]   Disney monopolistic issues, but buying a car company pretty easy
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.440]   because that's a fragmented market. I love this prediction.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.080]   I mean, now with Tesla with this depressed stock price, Apple
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.960]   can make a run at Tesla, they have they could almost buy it
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.760]   with cash. Let alone BMW, Volvo, one of those brands they could
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.800]   buy easily. What a great prediction for me. The
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.680]   prediction is Amazon's three legged stool grows into a sturdy
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.020]   chair chair with a fourth pillar. For those folks who are
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.360]   not familiar with how Amazon has built their businesses. There
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.840]   are three pillars in their stool. ecommerce, obviously,
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.200]   when you buy stuff, prime memberships, which is kind of
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.680]   consider a separate revenue stream. And of course, AWS
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.340]   cloud computing, I think the fourth is going to be this
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.760]   continuation of following the health stream, not advertising,
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.560]   because that's not a consumer based product. That's just the
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.440]   way they make money. Health is going to be a big one for them.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.000]   They obviously acquired one medical which was a small
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.200]   purchase. I think they're going to buy Roman hymns, they're
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.840]   going to buy Peloton, they could buy a whoop, and they're going
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.200]   to go all in on health. And you know that three legged stool
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.480]   becomes a very sturdy chair. And my runner up is Tick Tock is
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.400]   going to divest under duress. I think that it's going to have to
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.240]   go public and the Chinese are going to divest their interest
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.320]   in it and just take their chips because they're going to be
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.740]   faced with the existential threat during the political
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.600]   debates of the next two years, there will be unanimous support
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.760]   from Democrats and Republicans to get Tick Tock out of the US.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.880]   Therefore they divest.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   Can I just test that with you guys because we've talked about
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.400]   this a lot that hey, we're gonna ban Tick Tock. How many of your
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.520]   friends kids or your kids do you guys know spend hours a week on
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.320]   Tick Tock 100% lot 90% How do you get over the political
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.480]   mountain of trying to ban Tick Tock? If you try and ban Tick
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.720]   Tock, whoever raises their hand and says we should ban Tick Tock
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.560]   and actually gets it done. They're out of office. There is
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.680]   going to be so much pressure and backlash because people are
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.360]   hooked and love that app and use it all the time to take that
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.240]   away from people will feel like this kind of young kids that
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.000]   don't have phones actually get everything that Tick Tock has on
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.040]   YouTube shorts. So I don't think Tick Tock is that important
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.800]   because it is not actually there is no sticky network effect
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.400]   inside that app. So there isn't usage that's dependent on people
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.760]   you know, or a graph that you build. It's a lot of passively
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.000]   consumed content. And so you know, you're you're getting
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.320]   pushed a lot of algebra algorithmically defined content,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.800]   you can do that on YouTube. And so I actually don't think it's
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.080]   that meaningfully important. If Tick Tock goes away, I think the
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.000]   content creators stay. It's harder for them to build a
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.960]   business on YouTube shorts. But if you look at the men measure
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.560]   the density of content inside Tick Tock, it exists almost one
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.320]   to one on YouTube.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.800]   That's interesting. It's an interesting thing. You think
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.520]   it'll you think it'll be okay if we if we cancel Tick Tock in the
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.120]   US and we say that's it you can't have to talk to YouTube
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.880]   and it's disruptive, but people will just go to YouTube and
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.440]   Instagram. It's not that big of a deal.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.360]   In fact, a lot of the my favorites,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.120]   if there was a network effect inside there, then I think
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.880]   people would have a reason to complain to somebody, whether
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.040]   it's your representative, or whether it's somebody else to
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.200]   say, Hey, don't do this, this would have a deleterious impact
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.320]   on my quality of life or my quality of experience. And you
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.040]   could make that clear claim on Instagram, Facebook, you know,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:01.120]   Google, YouTube. But Tick Tock is is much more brittle that
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.960]   way. And that's why they need to get public sooner and
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.440]   monetize this bloody thing. Because I think that it's very
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:13.000]   easy actually, to deconstruct Tick Tock's value into these
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.920]   other places.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.280]   I can tell you my favorite Tick Tock is chefs reactions. And I
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.520]   consume him now on Instagram because he posts, we just copies
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.480]   one to the other. And
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.640]   so chefs reactions is a great example where he actually got
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.840]   banned by Tick Tock and then diversified on his own. And now
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.720]   what he does is he publishes across multiple streams. And if
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.760]   you look at all the big creators, they all do that
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.600]   because it makes no sense to actually give the power to any
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.280]   one of these things.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.200]   Why have a dependency?
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.360]   Why have a dependency?
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.480]   All right, let's keep the trains moving. Most contrarian belief.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.120]   This is the Peter Thiel award, your chess partner, sex, who's
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.800]   winning in 2022 in chess, how many chess games do you have
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.120]   going with Peter Thiel right now? And who's higher rated you
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.200]   demolished me with your Queens gambit. I played one game I got
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.320]   killed in seven moves. I'm ranked at 800 900 right now.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.680]   sax is at 1800. He just walloped me. Who's higher rated?
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.200]   You accepted the Queen's gambit? Well, you know, I just I didn't
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.080]   even know what it was. I was like, what opening is this?
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.360]   You're like, Queens gambit, you're dead. Boom.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.600]   You don't want to accept the Queen's gambit. Very pleasant
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.720]   game for white. I'm going to go on a limb here, you know, and
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   risk being wrong. My my prediction or most contrarian
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.920]   belief is that the bromance between Biden and Zelinsky comes
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:34.360]   to an end at some point in 2023. And let me state that the part
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.880]   that I think is conventional wisdom and everyone agrees with
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.680]   which is there's going to be a massive Ukrainian counter
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.360]   offensive in the spring. And I think that could go one of two
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.560]   ways. Either it could make limited gains, basically, the
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.640]   Russians fight them to a stalemate, or it could be
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.200]   successful. And they could basically push the Russians back
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.400]   to the February 23rd lines and then make it play for Crimea. I
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.760]   predict that in either one of those circumstances, Zelinsky
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.640]   his interests, and Biden's interest will start to diverge.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.440]   So in the case of a stalemate, which I think is probably 5050
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:12.480]   here, Biden's got to start going into election mode for 2024. And
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.880]   I think we're saying that we're going to be in a recession. So I
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.560]   think that if there's a stalemate, I think Biden's going
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.360]   to tell Zelinsky wrap this thing up, it's time to negotiate, we
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.200]   need to get this over with. By the same token, if the
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.360]   counteroffensive successful, I think that the administration
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.240]   hopefully cooler heads will prevail and not let them take
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.360]   Crimea, that's basically what they're gunning for, is they not
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.920]   only want to get back to the February 23rd lines, they want
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.400]   to go all the way back to the 2014 lines of retaking Crimea. I
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.560]   think that's extremely dangerous. I think that could
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.480]   precipitate a nuclear war. And I think that the cooler heads the
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.160]   administration will tell Zelinsky to stand down. And
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.000]   that's the right time to make a deal. So I think in either one
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.840]   of these scenarios, I think you will start to see a divergence
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.320]   between the Ukrainian and the American interest and that could
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.600]   create a rift. And I think no one's really predicting that.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.640]   I think this is great. This is kind of what I thought the plan
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.920]   all along was, which was to deplete Putin of resources,
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.600]   distract him and then get the West off of his oil and, and try
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.200]   to do regime change, but do it by bleeding him. This would be
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.280]   proof positive of that strategy, which is bleed him to the end,
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.200]   and then sell Zelinsky out. I think that's actually, I know
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.960]   that I know it's cynical. But I think that's what we're doing. I
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.080]   think Ukraine is a tool to deplete Putin and then maybe get
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.600]   to regime change. I'm cynical as it gets with this Chamath, which
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.680]   are most contrarian belief of 2023.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:42.200]   I will go and pick that inflation, which people expect
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.120]   to fall off a cliff doesn't fall off a cliff as fast or as
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   meaningfully as people want. And so I will explain inflation as
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:56.360]   three different chapters. And we've seen the first two
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   chapters play out. So 2021, chapter one was all about energy
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.560]   inflation. And you know, we all talked about having almost $10
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:09.240]   gas at the pump, and what does it mean for everybody and it
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.760]   caused that initial spike in inflation. And then we had it
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.400]   come off and sacks called this he said, you know, we're going
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.120]   to have this sort of double hump. And 2022 was really the
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.600]   story of goods inflation, right? All these prices and all of
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:29.080]   these things went up because the input costs went up, and we all
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.360]   had to bear the implications of that. But then that started to
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.920]   ebb. Now, if you look at the tail end of 2022, what I found
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.800]   super interesting was the number of articles I saw about wage
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:49.000]   inflation, whether that was Biden using an 1800s era law to
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.240]   prevent a railroad strike, the number of states that increased
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:58.440]   minimum wage, the trend around unionization. So in general, my
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:04.600]   thought is that the pendulum is swinging very markedly away from
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.320]   capital and towards labor. And as the labor participation rate
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.720]   stays low and continues to go down. And also it's compounded
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.240]   by an unemployment rate that may go up, right people are, it's
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.480]   going to be harder and harder to get people to do the work you
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:24.680]   need at the company you have, unless you pay them more. And if
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.000]   that gets exaggerated, then inflation will stay where it is,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.760]   it won't be as muted, and it won't fall off a cliff as people
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.600]   want. It'll be persistent. That's my big contrarian got it
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.440]   wager for this year is that we that is quite a shame. We see
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.800]   wage inflation that keeps inflation not going down as much
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.320]   as people want.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.200]   This is contrarian because everybody's saying, hey, it's
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.080]   over, the consumers back has been broken, the credit card
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.680]   debt is high. And everybody's being laid off, yada, yada,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.960]   yada, therefore, goods and services, there'll be more
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.880]   supply than demand, and the prices will lower. Very
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.640]   contrarian free break. You have a contrarian belief for 2023.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:09.880]   I think my it follows my earlier points about the Saudi
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:17.560]   China, Russian, Russia trade this year exiting 2023. It may
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.920]   be the case that, you know, there's historically been this
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.400]   belief and this continuing belief that the US dollar will
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.880]   always be the de facto global reserve currency. And the
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.160]   current mantra is that it's better than the rest. Everyone
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.440]   else is worse off than the US Western Europe is in trouble.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.440]   Japan is in trouble. China is in trouble. Everyone's in trouble.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:39.840]   But if there is a coalition, an economic coalition, a scale
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.400]   economic coalition, that starts to shift the balance of power a
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.800]   little bit, and the US meanwhile, is taking on
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.240]   extraordinary debt load, spending $1.7 trillion in an
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.240]   omnibus bill, you know, has this massive unfunded Social
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.440]   Security problem coming down the pipe, and are trying to manage
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.600]   multiple funded conflicts around the world. It could be that the
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.160]   US dollar coming out of 2023 starts to trade more like a risk
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.640]   asset, and less like a risk free asset. And so I think that
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.800]   that's my big contrarian bet is that maybe this year marks the
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.640]   beginning of the end of the US dollar as the kind of global de
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:22.040]   facto reserve currency. Based on some of these big trades that I
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.080]   talked about happening. So that would be my, my big kind of
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.640]   contrarian
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:30.280]   perfectly said, that's your contrarian bet the accent, the
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:34.800]   Legion of dictators, the MBS is etc. They become they form a
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.320]   global currency. Yeah. My term, not yours.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.600]   I'm not calling it. Yeah, I wouldn't say Legion of
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.880]   dictators. And I wouldn't say forming a global currency. But I
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:49.080]   do think that the fact that that large economic trading models
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.640]   start to be done in non dollar denominated form, got, you know,
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.520]   we can the kind of reserve status of the dollar to some
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.120]   degree, not fully right, it doesn't happen in a binary way.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.640]   And then the dollar starts to trade more like a risk asset
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.440]   like other currencies do to some degree, not fully. So maybe
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.280]   once again, we start to see that shift.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.120]   Once again, I take the exact opposite of your contrarian
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.600]   belief. I believe American exceptionalism continues to
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.520]   soar, as Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, to a lesser extent,
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.200]   continue to self sabotage themselves with insane wars like
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.920]   Putin has done, or cutting off the heads of entrepreneurs in
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.160]   China figuratively, I'm saying here, I think you cannot have
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.320]   exceptionalism without entrepreneurs without people
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.880]   having freedom. And I think that means American exceptionalism
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.360]   based on freedom is going to continue and the legion of
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.480]   dictators, I believe, are going to stab each other in the back
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.320]   before they change the world or move the currency. Can't trust
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.840]   them, though they'll snip at each other. And or they'll self
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.280]   sabotage.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.440]   Exactly. What do you fall on our opposite? Yeah,
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   I think that America is really feeling its Wheaties right now.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.080]   I think that American power is immense. I think that the
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.360]   superiority of our weapons in Ukraine has been one of the big
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.600]   surprises of the war.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.400]   Let's go Palmer lucky. I don't see the world in the simplistic
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.640]   good guys versus bad guys frame that Jake out does. However,
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.200]   America is on turbo right now. And yes, it is true that the
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.720]   bricks would love to get off of the dollar, because we are now
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.280]   using the dollar and the financial system and swift as a
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.720]   as a geopolitical tool and a weapon. And they would very much
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.280]   like to be off of our dependence on our currency. But I don't
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.840]   think they're anywhere close to be able to do that yet. And
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.480]   like I said, America is on turbo right now. Now, one thing one
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.040]   thing I want to mention this just came out White House
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.760]   correspondent named Jennifer Jacobs just reported that the US
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.800]   has agreed to send Bradley armored vehicles basically our
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.680]   best tanks to Ukraine. Previously, US officials had
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.840]   balked at sending armored vehicles saying heavier weapons
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.280]   be too difficult for Ukraine to operate and maintain bad allies
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.920]   are moving to provide such weapons. So we keep providing
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.440]   the Ukrainians with more and more sophisticated weapons, more
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.360]   and more support. Like I said, this is leading up to a huge
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.720]   Ukrainian counter offensive in the spring. And I really don't
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.840]   know what's going to happen at that point. I do think that the
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   Russians will escalate. I don't think they can afford to lose
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   this war. They view it as existential. And I like I said,
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.800]   I hope cooler heads will prevail. And if the Ukrainians
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.160]   are successful at breaking through, I hope that the Biden
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.280]   administration will shut this down before they try to retake
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.800]   Crimea. Because, you know, we've discussed this before, I
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.280]   think the Russians confronted with a choice between a total
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.000]   defeat that includes losing Crimea and their naval base of
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.280]   Estopel and sees the Ukrainian flag flying over their base at
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.600]   seven Estopel if that's a choice between that, or potentially
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.720]   using a tactical nuke, maybe at the mouth of the Crimean
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   Peninsula as a firewall, I think they could choose the nuke
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.520]   option. So it's a very dangerous situation. And, you
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   know, very, very dynamic. There's a lot of possibilities.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.680]   All right, let's go on to best performing asset of 2023. I'm
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.560]   going with C stage investing again. I don't think people want
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.600]   to get into these toxic cap tables at the late stage as
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.640]   Chamath pointed out. So I go with C stage, you know, and up
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.840]   to series A, the people brave enough to place bets, the
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.040]   founders brave enough to start companies, I believe it's the
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.240]   best performing asset class of 2023. Chamath, who do you got?
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.720]   I think that there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.040]   and in the markets. And so I'm generally concerned that there's
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.080]   a lot of chop. And so I pick something that's pretty
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.160]   conservative. But I would have a combination of cash and the
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.880]   front end of the yield curve. So T bills all the way up to two
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.280]   year bonds. So you can generate four and a half probably by the
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   end of this year 5% pretty safely. owning this stuff while
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.400]   you wait for things to become more certain. And the way that I
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.280]   think about it is that I would rather miss the first 10 or 15%
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.840]   of a rally. Once we're really done this stuff, then try to
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.600]   overcorrect and try to pick a bottom just because I think that
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.400]   you could lose a lot of money. So I think the goal for this
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.560]   year is to stay resilient and in the game. And so owning having a
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.840]   bunch of cash on the sidelines ready to pound it in. Meanwhile,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.720]   a portion of it collecting 5% is not such a bad thing while you
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.400]   wait for the bottom.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.680]   Fantastic. My answer was actually very, very similar,
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.320]   which is if cash carries right, that rates are going to 5.4% in
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.720]   q1. Why wouldn't you just put all your money in short term T
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.400]   bills, you earn five, five and a half percent risk free? Yeah,
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.200]   like set it and forget it. Yeah. And that's why capital flows are
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.400]   moving hugely right now from equities into bonds. Especially
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.120]   if we're going to recession, which is inherently
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.920]   deflationary.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.720]   What do you got for Berg?
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.680]   forming asset class of 2023.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.880]   One of the things so I think it's inevitable that we continue
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.480]   to have significant infrastructure spending from
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.360]   both the stimulus and security point of view. So you know, we
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.560]   kind of want to continue to stimulate the economy and
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.000]   support growth, we want to continue to create jobs and
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.360]   support this transition and the risk if the if the recession
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.560]   predictions play out true in the job market does loosen, it's
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.240]   very tight right now. There's going to be even more of an
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.920]   impetus to continue to do infrastructure investment. But I
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.440]   think there's also these big economic transitions happening
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.680]   underway right now with pharmaceuticals, with
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.800]   semiconductors, with energy, there's a lot that we've talked
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.160]   about where there's a security problem, and a redundancy
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.600]   problem. And so you know, there are a couple of ways to kind of
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.880]   play this infrastructure spending thesis in each of those
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.360]   areas. I've kind of highlighted four of them. One is in
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.800]   semiconductor capital equipment. So K like 10 core applied
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.960]   materials that that range of businesses that provide and sell
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:03.720]   the equipment into the fabs and the and the organizations that
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.880]   build semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.200]   second is kind of an oil and gas services. So similar to what
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.280]   sex said earlier, Schlumberger Baker Hughes, that class of
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.760]   businesses, I think benefit in this in this environment, and
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.680]   this is independent of kind of economic condition, certainly,
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.280]   because these are big multi year spending projects. The third is
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.760]   in the equipment to support them. So deer and caterpillar.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.200]   And then the fourth, I think is an important one. I'll talk
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   about this in a minute with respect to my biggest kind of
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.480]   anticipated thing for next year, which is in a pharmaceutical
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.080]   infrastructure. So thermo Fisher, and there's some company
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.560]   and others like them, because there's a lot of build out
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.920]   happening to support these big transitions happening in the
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.680]   modalities that are being used in pharmaceutical drugs and
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.200]   diagnostics.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.960]   And then I think that there's also a couple of these
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.520]   businesses that are diversified, like Danaher Honeywell,
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   thermo fish is a good example that play across multiple of
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.680]   these, these opportunities. So those are those are all great
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.160]   businesses to own, and you don't need to worry about, you know,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.440]   they're growing cash flow, positive dividend paying
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.720]   companies, and you don't need to worry about, you know, am I
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.280]   getting 5% or five and a half percent based on the equity
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.840]   price this year, these are long range businesses that are
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.960]   building real value, growing their top line, and compounding
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.200]   value from within. And then they're acquiring a lot of
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.960]   smaller businesses very cheap. I'll say what that's an
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.600]   important trend I've seen across these companies, Danaher
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.000]   Honeywell, thermo Fisher, they buy small companies, they pay
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.120]   very little, and they immediately get massive return
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.920]   on invested capital, like they're in the high teens. So
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.640]   why get 5% on T bills, when you can get high teens ROIC on the
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.320]   management teams running these incredible platforms. So that's
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.040]   where I'm most excited for this year.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.800]   Okay, now let's move on.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.400]   That was like a mad that was like my my mad my mad money
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.680]   segment. I've never done the mad money segment before. But
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.440]   there you guys got
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.120]   worst performing asset. I went with energy because not that I
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.080]   think it's not important, but it just feels like everybody
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.360]   rushed into it in 2022. So it feels like it's overheated. And
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.600]   if we are in a recession, people might lower consumption in
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.160]   terms of energy and be looking for cheaper alternatives. So it
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.160]   could be overheated. So I went with energy. Chamath worst
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.360]   performing asset, you got one.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.800]   I think that if we've learned anything from the last three
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.280]   years, you have to separate the valuation of a company and how
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.560]   it performs in the stock market with its value in society. So
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.240]   for example, if you look at zoom, zoom's valuation has
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.640]   cratered, but its value in society has probably continued
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.480]   to go up, it's still a massively relied upon tool. The point is
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.120]   that markets do not give you credit for the value in society,
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.480]   they will give you credit when you are about to over earn, but
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.080]   then they'll pull it all back when they think that you're
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.120]   going to under earn. So in that lens, I think that tech will
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.280]   have a tough year. I think energy will have a really shit
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.680]   year. And probably the biggest asset class that is going to get
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.760]   pressured is going to be junk debt. And the reason is a bunch
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.160]   of these variable rate loans, when rates are at five and 6%,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.240]   that all of a sudden are like 11 1213 14% of the money that
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:14.560]   they're in. And if they're at 18% coupons, a bunch of companies
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.320]   will have trouble meeting their debt obligations, and we'll have
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.720]   to restructure the debt or we'll have to file so tech energy
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.440]   performing asset for 2023.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.240]   subcategory of what you must have said I think office towers
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.320]   in San Francisco are that is some serious toxic debt 27%
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.080]   vacancy rates and growing as Lisa's role. I think that a lot
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.560]   of virtually all of the San Francisco downtown is going to
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.800]   be owned by the bank soon. Because no one can real estate
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.600]   in San Francisco,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.840]   specifically the office towers, because no one wants to be in
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.240]   those those skyscraper buildings south of market, you
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.360]   know, mired in homelessness. So yeah, I mean, I think that a lot
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.880]   of those buildings can be owned by the banks, there's gonna be
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.640]   some major fire sales. Remember, this was the hottest commercial
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.400]   real estate market in the country a few years ago. And now
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.280]   it's the worst.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.640]   Well, look, what happened to look what happened to be read?
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.920]   What do you think about that crazy thing that happened with
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.040]   the Blackstone read? I mean, that's nuts. You know, what
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.480]   happened? Yeah, Blackstone has a product called be read. It's
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.280]   like a $70 billion exchange traded fund effectively. And
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.440]   what it is, is the ability for individual investors don't
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.960]   access to Blackstone's, you know, commercial real estate
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.280]   portfolio. And they had such a massive amount of redemptions
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.480]   that they had to close redemptions at the end of q4.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.440]   And they were worried that the redemptions were going to
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.240]   continue to go up. These are individual investors who
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.040]   basically sees the writing on the wall, as David said, and
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.240]   wants their money out. And so they went to the University of
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.880]   California pension system. And they essentially got a huge
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.640]   infusion of capital, I think it was about $4 billion, where they
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.280]   guaranteed 11 and a half percent interest to these guys for the
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.240]   $4 billion. And they also posted a billion dollars of their own
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.720]   equity in in the actual REIT to backstop it. So what does it
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.520]   show you, I think what Saks is saying is really right, it's it
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.200]   may not just be in San Francisco. But, you know, with
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.600]   all of these people either getting laid off with all of
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.480]   these people now working remotely, we may finally start
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.080]   to see the beginning of the reckoning in commercial real
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.760]   estate, which has been an unbelievably performant asset
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.300]   class up until right about now. And on top of that, you have to
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.480]   factor in these much higher rates. And so these building
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.200]   owners, if they financed it, which they invariably have
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.440]   always financed, they have huge variable rate payments that are
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.840]   due on these buildings, the rent rolls are lower, even people
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.680]   like Twitter is just refusing to pay the rent. So you have to
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.600]   take them to court. So it elongates when they have to pay.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.840]   And so you could miss a bunch of rent payments. And all of a
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.960]   sudden, the banks could just go crazy and take ownership of
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.440]   these things.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.080]   Okay. Do you have a worst performing asset class for 2023
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.040]   prediction? Sultan of science, Queen of Kenwa, Dave Friberg.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.080]   It's, it's really simple. I've mentioned it before, it's
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.560]   consumer credit, we assume that raising rising rates and
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.080]   inflation would taper down consumer demand, meaning
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.160]   consumers buying goods and stuff. And that certainly hasn't
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.680]   happened. I'm in Vegas right now. I was in the car yesterday
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.880]   and the driver grew up in Vegas. He's like, in all the I've
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.920]   lived my whole life in Vegas. He's like, I've never seen a
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.160]   December like we just had, it was packed the entire month.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.000]   He's like, normally in Vegas, it's dead up until Christmas and
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.280]   the New Year's people come into town, but it's normally dead.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.880]   He's like, I've never seen such a busy month. And I think we see
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.720]   this in the numbers consumers are still spending, like it's
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.840]   2021. They're still spending like interest rates are zero, as
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.960]   we talked about, consumer credit is skyrocketing, while rates are
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.120]   skyrocketing. And so I think we're going to run into a real
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.800]   wall with respect to consumer credit in sometime this year,
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.320]   and you're going to see, as you guys know, this is such a
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.560]   complicated, interwoven market of assets, that the way that
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.600]   this this can be traded, there's a lot of different ways to trade
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.280]   it. But I think it's going to be, in general, consumers are
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.520]   not going to be able to meet their debt obligations. And it's
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:08.800]   going to be
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.160]   could be mortgages, credit card debt, defaults are coming. Yeah,
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.200]   the markets, the market has priced in a bunch of this stuff,
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.520]   obviously companies like a firm and you know, the the what are
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.320]   they called buy now pay later companies, but credit card
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.560]   companies, mortgages, there's a lot of assets that you can start
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.160]   to kind of pick apart, where do you think this unravels first?
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.760]   How does what gets hit hardest? What's underpriced and
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.200]   overpriced? Probably a lot of good pair trading to do as
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.120]   Jamal kind of loves to talk about, with respect to which of
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.560]   these are more likely or less likely to be sensitive to this
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.040]   dynamic, but there's, I think it's, it's going to be a pretty
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.040]   ugly scene. Consumers just have way too much debt relative to
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.960]   their earnings right now. And it's pretty nasty.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.760]   And they have some confidence that they'll always have a job
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.880]   or some way to pay their for easy payments.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.800]   It's hard, it's muscle memory is serious. You know, you come out
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.200]   of 2021. When you had, it's not just stimulus checks, it was the
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.000]   low interest rate and easy credit availability everywhere.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.280]   And it's just easy to jump into getting new stuff and cool
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.120]   stuff. And then when you get used to getting new stuff every
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.920]   week, or every month, you kind of stick with it. And you're
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.200]   like, I don't want to give it up just yet. I just not just yet,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.520]   not just yet, you know, and so it's hard to kind of step back
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.320]   from spending when you have a new type of lifestyle. And I
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.160]   think that's what's going on.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.360]   I think this is an incredible observation.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.320]   There's a great tick tock of this guy that runs car
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   dealerships, and he sent them out on like, how much incredible
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.640]   money like what a significant percentage of people's income
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.760]   they are spending on their monthly car payments and people
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.960]   buy these cars that are well beyond what should be kind of a
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.320]   reasonable budget. If you were to go to Susie Orman for
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.960]   stretch, you're not by that freaking stretch. And this the
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.080]   stretching is gonna is gonna snap this year. Yeah,
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.320]   absolutely. Which brings us to the most anticipated track. I
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.640]   love it. Great one. Most anticipated trend of 2023.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.840]   Related to yours, I went with austerity. I have a friend who
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.120]   sometimes flies private often. And I was talking to him about
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.760]   his Christmas vacation. This friend of mine, Shemoth, instead
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.400]   of flying private to his vacation, he had to pick up his
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.160]   kids, he had to go back and forth. He was driving his car.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.920]   That was three hour. That was you. Okay, I didn't want to
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:20.680]   decloak. He would normally buy private to Lake Tahoe. And he's
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.360]   like, No, I can't go out with your skiing on Friday. I got to
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.680]   pick up my kids. And then I'm driving. I said, Wait a second.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.720]   How are you doing that? He's like, I'm driving a car. I said,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.440]   What? Who's driving the car? He said, I'm driving the car. And
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.960]   that's why I say austerity is my anticipated trend of 2023.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.040]   I agree with you. I actually think this is a really good
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.840]   opportunity to pull back on so much waste. I haven't really
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.560]   looked at my household budget and probably two or three years
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.400]   didn't even bother. Why? And then and then when I looked at
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.080]   it, I was like, wow, this is really inflated to a level that
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.040]   I didn't expect. Yes. But it makes a lot of sense to live in
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:16:00.960]   a more heads down austere way. I don't know. Yeah. I well, I
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.640]   mean, look at tonight's menu. You went with duck. I guess the
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.200]   olive fed Wagyu everything's off the menu. Now. No black
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.800]   truffles. We're having duck. We're down to poultry. That's
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.280]   just next week. We're gonna have pasta. It's okay. Come on.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.000]   austerity measures for everybody. They call it foul for
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.720]   a reason. Right? Oh, God. Saks. Do you buy into austerity? Where
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.560]   Chamath and I are austerity bell tightening as our trends? Where
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.360]   were you? What's your trend for? I think it's a pretty good
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:30.600]   trend. The trend that I am going to suggest will be to your great
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.840]   disappointment, Jay cow, which is Trump's influence in the GOP
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.680]   continues to wane. You're seeing it in real time right now. The
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.560]   headline is Trump's endorsement proves worthless to Kevin
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.240]   McCarthy in the speaker bid. Even the MAGA faithful like Matt
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.760]   Gates, like Lauren Boebert, they are ignoring Trump's pleas to
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.280]   get behind my Kevin. And in fact, they're kind of not just
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.480]   defying him but making fun of him. Matt Gates had a repost
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.040]   Trump saying sad exclamation point. And Boebert was saying
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.080]   that Trump needed to get behind her movement. So we have now a
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.000]   level of open defiance to Trump and the GOP his endorsements
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   just not are not what they once were. And even if somehow, Kevin
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.840]   McCarthy pulls us off. I think all that means is that Trump
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.640]   gets blamed for every swampy rhino compromise that McCarthy
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.320]   has to make to keep the government running over the next
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.640]   two years. So it's a lose lose.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.280]   Does that mean that populism is on the wane? Do you think like
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.440]   because the it's the electorate that got him elected in the
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.520]   first place? He was not very popular with politicians, the he
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.720]   was kind of an outcast when he got elected the first time. And
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.120]   that may be the case now, but he still got elected because the
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.560]   population loved him. People loved him. Is that going to
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.880]   happen? Do you think that means that the populism is kind of
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.440]   waning or the interest of the voters is waning on him? Or is
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.160]   it just the political parties alignment?
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.400]   Boebert only Boebert only won by a few 1000 votes. She didn't
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.000]   exactly crush it in Colorado.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.800]   I think a lot of this has to do with Trump's personal standing
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.360]   after the midterms, the candidates that he personally
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.000]   picked that were all in tough races, they all basically lost.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.520]   It was about the distraction he caused by making the 2020
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.120]   election such a big deal constantly looking backwards. So
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.880]   I think the Republican Party doesn't like the antics. It's
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:20.080]   not about the policies. I don't think I think it's 100% about
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.280]   the about Trump's electability and about his ability to get
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.400]   things done. And it's not really about the positions per se. So I
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.920]   think freebird to answer your question, I think that the
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.600]   future of the GOP will incorporate this populism, but
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.080]   it's going to find a better integration with the
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.920]   establishment wing of the Republican Party. And future
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.680]   candidates will have to basically satisfy both of those
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.560]   wings of the party.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.880]   sex was it was a straw that were maybe the two straws that broke
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.960]   the camel's back for Republicans and Trump in that relationship
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.520]   was it January six and the election denial like for
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.200]   Republicans is it just like, Come on, those are the two
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:57.640]   things
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.680]   this constant focusing on the 2020 election first, it costs
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.520]   them the cost Republicans that Georgia runoff seat with Purdue
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:09.400]   against Warnock. Purdue won on election night didn't clear 50%
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.320]   had to go to the runoff. This was happened the day before
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.360]   January six, this happened on January 5 of 2021. That was the
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.000]   first race where Trump's antics cost them. Then you had this
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.920]   midterm election, where you know all the candidates who had to
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.400]   appease Trump by talking about again, the last election instead
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.080]   of looking to the future, they got punished by the voters. I
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.120]   think Republicans want to win. I mean, they're tired of losing
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.680]   that simple. It's that simple.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.880]   Yeah, the job of a politician is to win freeberg. You got an
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.320]   anticipated trend of 2023.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:46.440]   I am excited about and want to share the point of view that I
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   think I'm selling gene therapies are becoming more mainstream. So
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:49.960]   these are
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.880]   pharmaceutical modalities where we use gene editing systems
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.960]   where you can actually go in and change or add genetic material
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   to cells in your body to resolve things like genetic diseases or
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.160]   change protein deficiencies or introduce new proteins. And then
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.440]   cell therapies where we engineer cells put in the body and those
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.320]   cells go and do things like attack and destroy cancer cells.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.360]   For example, there are currently 27 FDA approved cell and gene
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.400]   therapies on the market. There are over 1000 in clinical
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.200]   trials, many of which are already showing extraordinary
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.760]   efficacy and benefit today. These therapies cost upwards of
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.560]   a million dollars. So I think there's a massive and talking
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.800]   about the infrastructure investment conversation earlier,
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.760]   because of the number of diseases and the number of
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.000]   conditions and number of people that these therapies can treat.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.080]   I think there's massive infrastructure investment
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   opportunity coming forward this year. But also seeing these come
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.320]   to market come out of the clinical trials, get FDA
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.440]   approved, we have to ramp up and build up the infrastructure
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.720]   needed because it's not traditional, we make a drug in a
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.160]   factory and send it to people and they get it injected. These
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.760]   are much more complex, they require a much more complicated
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.880]   delivery mechanism, you have to have systems to engineer cells
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.240]   and edit them and put them back in your body. Those systems
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.200]   today take days or weeks and cost, you know, as a result, a
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.320]   million dollar plus per treatment. So I think that the
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.680]   cell and gene therapy opportunity, you know, the JP
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.280]   Morgan Healthcare Conference starts this week. It's the
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.560]   biggest biotech and healthcare conference in the world starts
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.880]   in San Francisco on Monday. This is one of the biggest areas of
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.120]   interest and one that everyone's investing against. But as these
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   come to market, there's, you know, we talked about this last
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.920]   week, genetic diseases, types of cancer that are going to be
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.080]   addressed. And I'm really excited about seeing more of
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.600]   these products come to market, seeing the whole kind of
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.240]   infrastructure and delivery system change.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.120]   All right, sorry to interrupt trying to keep the trains
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.040]   moving gene editing. Very good choice. All right, we end with
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.560]   this a little bit fun. Most anticipated media for 2023.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.360]   These are things we like to talk about the media here. Sometimes
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:51.680]   we talked about White Lotus season two amazing season. And
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.960]   maybe what you're looking forward to next year. I am
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.800]   really looking forward to in film Oppenheimer Christopher
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.000]   Nolan's movie about the Manhattan Project that should be
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.840]   extraordinary. I loved was Dunkirk his as well. I love
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.320]   Dunkirk. I like everything he does. And when he this is him
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.520]   becoming like a history uncle. I'm here for it. I'm here for
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.080]   Nolan becoming our history uncle, instead of Batman.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.360]   What was the one after inception? Oh, that was really
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.440]   confusing. The one with Denzel Washington's son with john
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.680]   Washington. Yes, it was. I couldn't finish it. I tried
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.800]   twice. I gotta go a third shot on that one. It was Oh, yeah, it
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:32.880]   was it was his worst film. It was called tenant tenant tenant.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.480]   Yes, about like time and reverse. And this it was
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.800]   possible to follow. Did you guys see his original film, which was
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.920]   incredible memento?
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.280]   Of course, it was fantastic. Yeah, and that was great.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.120]   It was enough mind mind. Yeah, it was mind bending enough that
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.440]   you're like, Oh, my God, incredible. And then I think
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.760]   they took it too far tenant. I tried to watch it three times.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.640]   I'm generally pretty good with these sorts of films and love
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.520]   them. But oh, my God, it was impossible to follow. He took it
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.880]   too far. Okay, so hopefully he goes back to his roots.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.480]   In terms of TV series. I'm looking forward to secession
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:09.160]   coming back Ashoka, who is Anakin Skywalker, aka Darth
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.080]   Vader's Padawan Ted Lasso season three coming up. Those are for
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.960]   me incredible. And then on the book front, man, the Michael
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.040]   Lewis book about SPF is going to be next level. I cannot wait for
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.680]   that. sacks. You're a media junkie. What do you got on your
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.600]   list of things you're looking forward to? Or should say what
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.080]   is Tucker's writers? What did they put down?
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.600]   Well, Jake, I thought you're gonna pick I thought that for
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.240]   movie, you're gonna pick cocaine bear.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.560]   I can't wait for cocaine.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:44.560]   Extraordinary bear is in the woods. And a, I guess people who
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.400]   are trafficking in cocaine drop their or crashes and the bear
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.920]   eats the cocaine and then goes on a rampage is kind of like a
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.480]   genre film like in the crocodile way. By the way, I'm listening to
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.960]   Quentin Tarantino's book, by the way of criticism. Get the
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.600]   audiobook. You'll like it sacks. He talks about all the films in
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.400]   the 70s. Very good. Shout out to Quentin. What do you got? What
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.080]   do you got on your short list? History Uncle?
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.760]   Me? Yeah, I just gave you one. But
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.160]   cocaine bear top of your list.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.200]   We'll watch it.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.080]   was on my list. And I think Marvel is doing a good job
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.640]   developing a new villain to rival Thanos with this with
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.800]   Kang. I don't know what phase they're on now. But for me
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.040]   season two, and then the new Ant Man movie. And, you know, I
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.920]   thought after Thanos, he wouldn't really be able to top
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.560]   that. But yeah, they've come up with a really good concept, I
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.440]   think, for the next, you know, 20 Marvel movies.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.440]   Well, and then it will eventually become Galactus.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.560]   Yeah, you guys have completely fucked up. You have missed the
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.440]   most obvious slam. Here we go. shot days new album go.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.920]   Dune, part two. Oh, I haven't watched number one yet. I got
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.320]   to wait what? You know, I was having a boring wasn't it? My
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.000]   wife wants to watch it. It is so stylistically beautiful. It is a
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.440]   little boring. There's not a lot going on slow, but it's so well
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.400]   shot. It's a fun. It's visually just stunning. I mean, if you
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   need to watch it on a big screen with big speakers and but
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400]   part two comes out in November this year. Absolutely. That's
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.800]   okay. Great. Freeberg, tell us what documentary on veganism
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.600]   you recommend and you're anticipating for 2023. What
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.520]   vegan documentary or animal abuse documentary?
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.080]   I am excited about the generative AI based media that I
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.720]   think is going to start to kind of rocket this year. We could
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.640]   see for example, the first, you know, AI written symphony, the
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.840]   first kind of AI written published novel, how
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.160]   interesting would that be like a full novel published by AI and
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.080]   more maybe short films based on AI driven script. And maybe even
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.840]   what I'm really excited about is these AI based interactive
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.800]   video games or kind of experiences where you the user
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.600]   kind of get to create and live your own world through some sort
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.600]   of video game type modality. So I think AI driven media.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.080]   All right. There you have it, folks. There are
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.120]   speaking of pop culture chaos, I guess. Prince Harry has a book
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.720]   coming out. That's called spare.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.680]   That's fair.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.720]   Spare, like, you know, like, playing bowling,
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.680]   you know, but you know, like in in the English monarchy, they
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.520]   there's the air and the spare. So he's calling himself but to
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.560]   me, that's like a weird self description. Yeah, like, that's
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.080]   that's how you see yourself as just
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.160]   being self deprecating. He didn't pick that. They paid him
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.240]   so much money. I heard they have to sell 1.7 million books to
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.800]   break even. But you know, what it reminds me of is when Leonard
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.720]   Nimoy wrote a book, I think he wrote a book called I am Spock.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.640]   And then he wrote a book called I am not Spock. Nice. He could
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.880]   never get comfortable with the fact that he was just Spock.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.720]   Yeah. And there's something weird about calling yourself
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.280]   spare, like, you know, you're clearly not comfortable with
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.000]   it's like the
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.960]   everything. Yeah, everything they taught you everything I
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.440]   learned at Harvard Business School, and everything they
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.320]   don't teach at Harvard Business School, you can you can do both
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.120]   books. All right, listen, this has been great. Breaking news as
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:13.160]   we're talking here chat GPT, open AI, doing a tender offer at
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.480]   29 billion.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.080]   3 billion a day. Oh, my God.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.440]   29. It's it's founders fund or reportedly, according to the
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.520]   journal, it's founders fund thrive capital. So founders fund
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.640]   does not generally do super overpriced deals. Yeah.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.800]   Yeah, I would buy that.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.360]   That's a silly picture. I mean, come on,
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.720]   dude, are you kidding me? That's that could be a $300 billion
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.640]   company. That's a tenant, right? But that yeah, it's a 10x from
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.280]   here. I wouldn't I would not. Totally could be. By the way,
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.760]   you guys remember that the long way of open AI, I don't know
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.160]   what the current situation is. But it was a nonprofit. Yeah,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.360]   where they said investors put money in, but the investors
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.680]   maximum return was 100x on the dollar invested. No, I don't
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.920]   think nonprofit, but it's up to 100x. No, no, that happened
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.760]   afterwards. It's when they can learn the original model. Yeah,
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.320]   the know the original model was a pure
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.280]   and they can run any shares. No, no, the original model was a
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.840]   pure nonprofit where there was no cap because there was no
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.000]   concept of equity. Yeah, when they flipped, they kept
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.160]   everybody to 100x on the return. So the original money, but not
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:19.240]   anymore or still, but no, the original money, which was like
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:25.160]   Elon's money. Who else put in money? Read? Yeah, all that
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.960]   money came in as a as pure nonprofit. So I don't know how
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.240]   it converted. But that's when they
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.680]   or did it convert to those people who funded it originally
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.320]   get any shares in the for profit, we could we could find
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.200]   out probably they did. I mean, it would make sense that they
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   will find out. But I mean, wait, if this is a tender offer,
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:44.080]   27 billion, you wouldn't buy shares at 27. So again, like
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.320]   the thing that I want to impress upon you is like, there is an
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.320]   enormous amount of work that they do, that what their biggest
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.960]   gap to monetizing this will be finding unique content that they
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.800]   learn on that nobody else has access to. And this is why I
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.520]   really think it's important to understand, if you have enough
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.480]   compute, these all of these unsupervised learning models, if
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.080]   you run them on the same training set, will converge to
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.040]   the same answer. So you're just getting there first. So in
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.400]   order to be really defensible, you have to get there in a
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.040]   unique way. And so either you're going to hand tune, or you're
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.320]   going to have inputs that are different. So I don't know, I
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.240]   don't know the answer. That's why like, they have to answer
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.040]   that question in their fundraising. And I'm sure that
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.520]   they did, because these are smart investors. But that's the
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.280]   big idea that you have to overcome. And again, you have to
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.760]   think like, you think Google is sitting on their hands? No, or
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.160]   Google is
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:43.400]   29 billion, like what fundamentals is that based on?
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.320]   Like, why not 5 billion? Why not 3 billion? I mean, like, why not
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.480]   10 billion? Like what makes it double valuation? That's what it
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.240]   is. It's all this all momentum said nothing to do with reality,
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:58.200]   right? I mean, it this would imply at a 30 the public comps
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.800]   public Google trades at what 25 or 30 times EBITDA. So this
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.680]   would imply a billion dollars in EBITDA, a billion dollars in
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:10.240]   EBITDA, $3 million a day, they're losing $3 million a day
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.880]   on computer for reportedly $3 million a day in profit on what
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:16.360]   product? I don't know, they have a
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.600]   I said, that's not the issue. I think Look, I mean, my point was
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.360]   if these guys open up a set of tools that support all these
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.320]   applications and services to emerge on top of what they've
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.560]   built, and they're getting red share getting payments out of
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.320]   that, it's going to very quickly turn into a real
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.880]   here's the problem. This is why that can't happen. They don't
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.920]   have the rights to the data they built the training set on. And
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.920]   the second they commercialize it, the second anybody pays them,
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:45.360]   whoever they base this on to good into oblivion, I predict
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.680]   suit into oblivion.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.920]   Let's talk about let's let's actually let's talk about that
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.840]   in the next show. Because I think that's like the way that
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.000]   AI works. And we should probably bring someone like Sam on to
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.040]   talk about it. But the way that AI works on training data, and
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.160]   now people are making claims that the training data is
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.640]   copyright, therefore, of course, model output is protected,
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.320]   protects that copyright is I think worthy of a good
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:05.960]   conversation.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.120]   What's interesting is, you know, the early, the early version of
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.720]   the of the internet was very simple. It's like you had this
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.320]   file called roblox.txt. And you would basically be open to a
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.760]   crawl or not. And that's what would allow Google to basically
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.040]   go and spider your pages, right. And so we have to replace this
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:26.840]   concept of that with this AI dot txt. Well, you could make a
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.960]   claim that this is no different than, you know, a spider
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.400]   crawling a web page, except that in the in the search case, it was
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.040]   much cleaner, which is we're just going to index your page
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.880]   and redirect people to you. Here, it's we're actually going
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:43.880]   to create a derivative work because of you and go. And I do
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.000]   think that that's going to be a very interesting legal
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.480]   threshold that has to get figured out.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.120]   Well, here it is, Chamath, you're nailing it. Exactly.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.200]   It's a derivative work, and they did not have permission to use
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:57.440]   it. And it impedes upon the original authors, whether it's
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.320]   a photo, it's a song, it's a piece of code, it impedes upon
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.000]   their ability to do commerce in the world, you are interfering
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.120]   with their ability to monetize their content, and the
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.720]   percentage you're using is 100%. So when you get to fair use,
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.640]   non commercial use is very protected, parodies protected
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.800]   education's protected. But when you dip into using the entirety
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.920]   of the work, which they're doing, and you impede upon the
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.520]   person's ability to commerce, and you confuse the public,
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.480]   well, this is why I test that they will fail, fail, fail.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.960]   This is why I think that most people don't understand what AI
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.960]   is, they don't even understand the difference between training
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.320]   and inference. So hopefully, there is some more understanding
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.920]   of this. But if you use the same data set, you will eventually
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:44.160]   converge to the same outputs absent of hand tuning weights,
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.360]   which has its own issues, and absent any asymmetrically
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.800]   different data that you have that nobody else has.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.280]   Absolutely. Yes. So if you are Apple, and you have the watch
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.960]   data, or your Google, and you have the search data, or you're
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.720]   a weather company, you have the weather data, and your
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:03.160]   proprietary, of course, there's a very easy solution to this
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.360]   tomorrow. Number one, citations, when the algorithm gives you an
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.560]   answer, it should say what were the top percentage sources of
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.400]   this information? How did the AI?
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.320]   No, but Jason, again, look, if you look inside of a transformer,
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.320]   the problem is, okay, that you're going to have trillions
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.640]   of ranks, trillions of weights, trillions. And so how are you
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:26.600]   going to decide how to basically draw a line under a threshold?
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:30.520]   This was actually a useful input, and this was not. So
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.920]   again, I just think that it's hard, a very few small class of
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.120]   people actually understand this, like the great person to
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.800]   actually bring in to talk about this would be Andrej Karpev. He
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.440]   would not. And I think because Andrej was there, sure, and at
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.640]   Tesla, and he but he can say it in a very dispassionate way to
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.280]   explain this to people, I think we should, we should ask him to
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.640]   come on. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I can ask him.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.400]   I can. I mean, this is brand is this the law, Sachs, you're an
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.680]   attorney, you understand fair use, copyright, all this stuff.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.640]   The law, correct me if I'm wrong here, Sachs does not
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   anticipate this.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.640]   Like this highly specialized area, I don't want to pretend
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.640]   like I understand the law in this area. You know, I'd want to
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.840]   talk to a specialist.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:08.760]   Yeah. Okay.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.440]   So anybody, let's have this conversation. I think, yeah,
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.240]   this is a great discussion work for us to talk about because
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:18.240]   this is probably why, by the way, they started as open
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.800]   source, because it was like a slam dunk thing to make this a
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.680]   nonprofit and open source everything, because maybe in
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.560]   part because of these issues, but if you just let the code run
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:33.400]   free, you probably don't have to even deal with these issues.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.000]   Right? Well, they they closed it. Remember their claim. The
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.920]   claim was this is too dangerous. Their original claim was it's
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.040]   too dangerous for people to not see the code. Then Sam flipped
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.440]   on that. And he said, it's too dangerous for people to see the
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.920]   code. And it started out as a nonprofit, where the idea was
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.160]   the way to keep this safe is for everybody to see the code. But
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.760]   they didn't make any money, whatever private and they flip
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   the decision. So keep that in mind as well.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.680]   He's a he's a very, very, very clever business person.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.440]   He's savvy. And,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.760]   you know, Paul Graham, when Paul Graham picked Sam to run YC
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:10.120]   Paul Graham said that this is the most impressive person I've
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:13.440]   met since Steve Jobs. Yeah. Remember that on the pot? I do
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.080]   remember that. He said something similar about Gary Tan is now
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.080]   running YC starting this week. Sam Altman, friend of the pot
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.720]   come on all in anytime and has played in our poker game several
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.200]   times. Yes, yes, we we had a tough situation there where you
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:28.880]   interfered in a hand if you remember. All right, listen,
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.800]   this is what there was a Sam and I were in a hand of poker. He
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.520]   raised, I had to pair and I'm trying to figure out does he
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.320]   have a set or is he bluffing me? I think he's got top pair. And
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.320]   you were like, Oh, look at this. And you started commenting on
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.160]   the hand. Oh, my God, I remember the call or not yet. And I'm
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.600]   like, God, I'm like, come on. For my little bush. Let's let's
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.640]   stop talking here. Because I'm trying to play and I'm like,
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.440]   okay, Sam would get and I basically came to the
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.760]   conclusion, Sam would get the light, great delight bluffing
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.160]   me off a hand. He's a risk taker. He knows I'm conservative.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.280]   He knows he's a risk taker. I'm gonna call here with my I had
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:05.000]   bottom two. I'm like, does he have a set and there was also a
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.440]   straight on the board. I'm like, fuck it. I at best I'm, you know,
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.800]   even money here. But there was a lot in the pot. So I was just
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.460]   doing the pot odds while I'm doing the pot odds. You were
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:19.600]   like, which is usually me. I'm usually the one being
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.500]   reprimanded for talking. But it was notable. I listen. Love you
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.960]   besties. Why don't you tell people that there's no comments
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.100]   and just as a programming note, we turned off comments for a
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.200]   couple of weeks on the YouTube just to see how it's
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.680]   psychologically affects me and for Chamath to just ask with all
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:39.880]   you Brigadooners. We love you. Besties. This has been a great
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.600]   episode. Two great and his Twitter is at Chamath and he
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.440]   doesn't read it. So everyone knows me no sex sex and I voted
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.080]   against turning off comments. Just just voted in favor of
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.800]   whatever got Chamath's vote for the All in Summit 23. So that's
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.560]   how I this is horse trading now. But the podcast has never been
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.040]   better. Besties spending time together on the slopes is the
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.100]   cure to all evils. We'll see you next time. Love you besties. Bye
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.600]   bye. Love you guys. Bye bye.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.560]   Let your winners ride
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.080]   Rain Man David
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:12.400]   Sass
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:19.000]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:19.840]   it. Love you.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:20.840]   West Coast Queen of
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.080]   besties are
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.360]   dog taking a
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:41.440]   should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.280]   because they're all just like this like sexual tension that
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.160]   they just need to release
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.560]   your
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.360]   your feet
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.200]   good. We need to get murky.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:54.720]   Oh,
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.240]   man.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:03.400]   Oh, man.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.640]   (chanting)
