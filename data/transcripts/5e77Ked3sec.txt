[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   In the following sermon, recorded on Sunday morning the 7th of January 1962 in the Westminster Chapel,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.440]   Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the Book of Acts, chapter 9 and verse 31.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.600]   We would like to apologise, however, for the very poor quality during the first few minutes.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.880]   This is due to the original master tape having stretched.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.680]   The most interesting and lyrical description of the state and the condition of the early church
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.360]   at that particular point in her history. It's an account, of course, of the state of the church
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.400]   as a whole. There are those, and I think rightly, who say that this should be in the singular and
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   not in the plural, then of the church rest, and was abified. However, it comes to the same thing
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.240]   in the end. The point I was making was that this is true not only of the condition of the church
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.080]   as a whole at that point, but was obviously the condition of the individual members of the church
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.040]   also. There is no more fatal mistake than to regard the church as something apart from the
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.800]   individuals who compares her and who make her up. So, when we are told that this was true of the
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.000]   church, it means that it was true in general of the members of the Christian church at that point.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.200]   Now, the immediate occasion is interesting in and of itself. There had been a terrible
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.080]   persecution of the early church, led very largely by Saul of Tarsus, afterwards the apostle Paul.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.200]   But in the early part of this chapter, we are told of how that mighty man was converted on his way to
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.280]   Damascus, where, of course, he was intent upon yet fiercer and severer persecution of the church.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.480]   However, his conversion made a very great difference, and the result was that the churches
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.240]   had this period of rest. And what we are told in this verse is how they reacted to their
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   changed circumstances, and how they made use of this respite that was given them,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:18.480]   this period of quiet which was granted them of God in his mercy. Now, I call your attention to
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.760]   this because here it seems to me we are given an account of the ideal state of the Christian church.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.400]   This is how she should be. This is therefore what we should all always be as individual Christians.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.920]   And what can we do better on the first Sunday morning like this of a new year than just to
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.080]   remind ourselves of the ideal? Let's have a look at what the church was meant to be like,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.840]   in order that we may test ourselves by the description, and see how we've done in the past,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.000]   and in order that we may have a standard and a norm to which we must try to attain
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.960]   during the months and the years that lie ahead of us, God willing, as members of the Christian
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.120]   church. Now, you notice that there are two things which are told us here about the state of the
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.920]   church at that point. And I'm emphasizing that these are ever to be the two characteristics
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.720]   of the church. They're ever to be the two characteristics of every individual member
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   of the church. And the two things are these, that she was being edified, and the second thing is
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.600]   that she was multiplied. Then at the church's rest throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.320]   and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:52.640]   were multiplied. Now, these are the two things that we must hold most clearly in the forefront
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   of our minds. The multiplying means, of course, that there were additions to the church,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.520]   that others became members of the Christian church and joined the Christian church.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   And here are the two big things, therefore, which should always characterize the life
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   of the church when she is truly functioning as she ought. And these are the two things,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.280]   surely, at this present time, that we ought to be concerned about above everything else.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.840]   Now, you notice what they are. The first is our own state and condition,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.920]   our being edified. That's the thing that we find here first. And then following that,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.200]   our usefulness, the way in which, because we are in this state of edification,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.880]   that God can use us and imply us, with the result that others likewise become Christians
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   and are added to the church, and so the church increases and multiplies in number.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.120]   Now, here, therefore, is the thing I say that we must lay hold of as firmly as we can this morning.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   May the Spirit of God enable us to do so one by one. Surely,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.520]   such an exhortation was never more needed than it is at this present time.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.000]   We must be concerned, I say, about these things for this reason,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.080]   that first and foremost, the credit and the honor of the Lord God himself is involved in this matter.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.760]   I mean by that that the world, of course, always judges the church,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:45.600]   and the world through the church judges God. We make a unique claim. We are not just a human
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.000]   society. The world is full of such societies and associations, and everybody knows that they're
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.880]   man-made. Men have thought of them, men have organized them and planned them, and men are
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.040]   therefore responsible for them. But we make a claim which is quite different. We say this is
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.560]   not a human institution. We say we are God's people. We say that the church is his new creation
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.240]   by water and the blood. We say the church is a supernatural society.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.360]   Here is a body that God himself has made, the church of God.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   Very well. Now then, it follows from that, of course, that the name of God is involved in
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.440]   everything that is true of us. And we cannot blame the world for judging God
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:44.320]   and the Lord Jesus Christ by what it sees in us. And therefore, whether we are edified or not,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.600]   is not merely and not only a matter for ourselves and our own happiness and enjoyment of the
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.840]   Christian life. It has this further application that God himself is being judged, and there's
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.240]   no question about that at this present hour. The Christian church is being judged, and people are
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.040]   denying the Christian truth and making their statements about the Almighty God. They say,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.560]   "Look at the church. Look at her." That's the argument, and it's a very powerful argument.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, very well, I say we should realize this, and we should realize that it is our business to be
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.520]   edified because the honor and the glory of God are involved in this whole matter. And of course,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   it's involved not only in the matter that we should be good representatives of Christianity,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.640]   that to use the phrase of the Apostle Peter in his first epistle, the second chapter,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.360]   and the ninth verse, he says that we should show forth his praises, who hath called us out of
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.600]   darkness into his most marvelous light. That's what God is doing through us. He's showing forth
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.640]   his own excellences. He's showing his own power, his own grace, his own love. It is through us
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:08.080]   that God does this. Well then, it involves this not only that by being what we are we show his
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.160]   excellences, but in the same way the increase of his kingdom should be a matter of grave concern
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:23.520]   to us. Because if the church of God goes down instead of going up, well, again, the world draws
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.280]   its conclusion. It's wrong, of course, but we can't expect anything better from it. And therefore,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:36.480]   everything that happens to the church involves directly and immediately the honor and the glory
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:43.280]   of God. Now, if we had no other reason for taking these two words and applying them unto ourselves,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:50.880]   we've had more than enough there. Are we manifesting this edification? Are we proving
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:58.320]   that the claims we make for the Christian gospel are true by our growth and development? And are we,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.840]   as the result of this, leading to an extension and a multiplication and an increase of the number of
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.200]   Christian people in the world? Now, take that second one again. And there's our second great
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.800]   reason for being concerned about these things. The state of the world that is outside the church.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.360]   Now, these early Christians were very concerned about this.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.400]   And that is why wherever they went, they went speaking and preaching this word of God, we are
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.280]   told. And they did so because they had a great heart of compassion for the men and women who
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   were around about them. They themselves had been delivered. They'd received this enlightenment.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.400]   They were enjoying these blessings of the Christian life. And naturally, they desired
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.480]   that these others might know something about them. And therefore, they were used in this way,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   to the multiplication of the church, to the enlightenment of these people,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.640]   and to their conversion and their final addition to the Christian church.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.120]   Now, was there ever a time, I wonder, when we as Christian people should feel the power of this
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:14.960]   argument more than we should at the present time? Look at the state of the world. Look at its
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:24.160]   darkness, its hopelessness, its utter confusion, and yet its appalling sinfulness. It is, as the
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:31.280]   New Testament describes it, in utter darkness, under the dominion of Satan.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:39.920]   Do we feel a sense of compassion for the people? Our Lord did. He saw them as sheep without a
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:47.280]   shepherd. He came from heaven because of that. He died because of that. To what extent are we
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.600]   feeling this same compassion? He says he didn't come into the world to condemn the world,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.680]   and it's a terrible state of the church when she just spends her time in condemning the world.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   The world doesn't need condemnation, it's already under it. The world needs to be delivered,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.640]   it needs to be saved. So the business of the church is not just, I say, to condemn what the
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.880]   world is doing. It is so to represent the glories of this new life, that men and women shall be
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.960]   drawn to it and attracted by it. And as we look round the world, therefore, and see men and women
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   in utter hopelessness, who knows what's coming to meet us, who knows what may happen during this
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.760]   coming year and year, and people are not ready for it. They don't know how to live, they know
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.080]   still less how to die. They have nothing to fall back upon. Well, there they are. We are surrounded
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:45.120]   by such people in a state of darkness and ignorance and sin and utter and final hopelessness.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.080]   And it should be our chiefest concern, next to our own relationship to our blessed Lord and God,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.120]   that we should be used of him to bring this enlightenment and this knowledge to the people.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.960]   Well now, that is what happened, you see, at this point in the state of the early church.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.720]   The church was edified, and the result was that they were multiplied.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:15.120]   Now, I mustn't stop with this this morning, but I do commend to you to notice the order of these
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.960]   two things. The thing that is put first is the edification of the church herself,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   and the result of that is that she was multiplied, she was increased.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.680]   Here is an inevitable order. You'll find it in the Bible everywhere. You will find it in the
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.240]   long history of the Christian church, in all of the periods of her greatness and of her authority
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:47.040]   and her power. This is God's way of working. He starts always in the church, and when the church
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.080]   is edified, the church is used. Now, the whole danger today is, of course, to forget that.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   And all the emphasis is put upon evangelism, and nothing much seems to happen. In spite of
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.440]   all the efforts, the statistics alone prove that the Christian church is going down instead of
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.560]   being multiplied. When will we come back and understand this? God starts in his own people.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.880]   You and I are the evangelists. We are God's agents. It is through us God's going to do his
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.080]   work. And when the church is edified, she's multiplied. The order here is surely all-important,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.760]   and the greatest need of the hour is the edification of the Christian church.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   We must start with ourselves, my friends, and we should feel an awful sense of condemnation
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.960]   that the Christian church is as she is today. Now, let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.120]   Why is it that we are failing to attract the masses that are outside? That's the question.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.280]   Why is it that our lives are not such that men and women should come to us and say,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.640]   "Now tell me what's your secret? How do you live as you do? What is the secret of this
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.680]   extraordinary way in which you're able to live, and to face life and its attendant circumstances?"
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.560]   Now that's how these people acted. They were edified, and the result is that people came to
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.760]   them, and the churches were thus multiplied. This is the inevitable order. It is the order in the
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.120]   scripture, and as I say, it has always been the order in the subsequent history of the Christian
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.400]   church. Well, now then, what remains for us to consider is this. How can we become like this?
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.840]   How can we get into this state and condition in which it can be said of us, "They were edified,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   and they were multiplied"? Now, this is true of the church in general, it's true of this church
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.560]   in particular, but it is true, I say, of every single one of us as a Christian. How many people
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.520]   have become Christians because you are what you are? How often have you been used to bring somebody
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.000]   to a knowledge of God in and through the Lord Jesus Christ? Now, that's how these people were
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.920]   used. These were not all preachers. In fact, there were very few preachers amongst them.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.320]   These were just ordinary Christian people, but as the result of their being what they were,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.360]   people were added to the Christian church. How can we become such? Well, let's look at the answer
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.680]   that is given in this one verse. I'm not going to go outside it, let me just expound what the
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.480]   verse tells us. The first thing is this, we've got to make a right use of peace.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:33.600]   Then, at the church's rest, throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.160]   and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:45.600]   Here's the first thing. They made a right use of the rest and the peace that were granted to them.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   As I've reminded you, this came after a period of most terrible persecution.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.600]   But suddenly the persecution ended, and here they find themselves in a position of rest.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.000]   And what happened to them, the edification and the multiplication, as a result of the way in
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.520]   which they reacted to and made use of this rest and this peace that were given to them.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.320]   Now, I wonder whether this Astrakhi was being something strange and extraordinary,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   because I think it should. This should come to us more or less as a surprise, and for this reason,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:33.360]   that the general impression we always have is that the church is at her best when she's persecuted.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   And isn't it true to say of most of us that we are better people when we are undergoing some
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.800]   trial or affliction, than when everything's going well with us?
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.200]   Now, that is what is normally said, and what is normally thought.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   That when a man's ill, he's a better man than when he's well.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.920]   When the church is on trial and being viciously persecuted, she's purified.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.320]   Now, you read the history of the church, and you'll find that that has been the case
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.080]   on many, many occasions. And there are many who have to say, therefore, with the psalmist,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.200]   "It is good for me that I've been afflicted, because before I was afflicted, I went astray."
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.720]   But here, you see, we are told the exact opposite. Then, that the church is at rest,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.280]   and we're ready for it. Now, how do we deal with this? How do we explain this? Well,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:34.720]   unfortunately, the answer is but too simple. This is the right way. And what has been true
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.880]   of all of us, and true of the church in general so often, is the wrong way.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:46.400]   You see, it is because we fail to respond to the gospel and its message,
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.800]   that it becomes necessary that we should be chastised. But here, the early church was in
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   a healthy condition. And so, when they were given a period of rest and of peace, they used it.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.360]   And they were edified and multiplied, because they'd got peace.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.920]   It's a very convicting thought, this. You see, it means this, that we are so sinful,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.720]   that we fail to respond to the overtures of God and his love. And he has to chastise us
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.560]   in order to bring us to himself, and in order to deal with us and promote
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.840]   our sanctification. Is there anything more terrible than that we, as God's people,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.520]   should have to be driven to God? That it is necessary that we should be persecuted before
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.120]   we value the things we've got? You can read of people, even today, Christian people meeting
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   together at hazard of their lives. They may be shot, they may be killed, just because they're
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.120]   assembling together. But they do it. They seem to value these things because of the persecution.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.080]   And they'll risk everything in order to get together to worship God and to praise him,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.480]   whatever the cost may be. That's happening in the world today. It's happened throughout the
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.600]   history of the church. Times of persecution, men have risked life and limb in order that
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:18.240]   they might thus praise God together. But alas, when there are times of ease and of peace and
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.040]   an absence of trouble, well, we take it for granted. We can do it again.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   Oh no, it's all right. Plenty of time. We become slack and we become indolent.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:38.160]   And we make no effort at all. Now unfortunately, that is the truth, isn't it? But that's a measure
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:45.040]   of the sinfulness and of the failure of the church. Here is the healthy condition, here's
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.160]   the normal condition. You see, they're the exact opposite of what has been true of all of us and is
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.920]   so true of the church. Here are people who said at last, "Thank God the persecution is finished. Now
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.560]   then, we've got an opportunity. Let's make full use of it." And they did. They were given rest,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.880]   so they applied themselves. And the result was they were edified and they multiplied.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.680]   In other words, instead of saying, "Ah well, the persecution's gone. We can now relax. We can take
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:19.040]   our ease. We can have a slack time. Everything's all right." Instead of that, they said, "What a
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.960]   heaven-sent opportunity we've got. Now then, there's no longer any danger. We shall no longer
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.400]   be molested. Very well then, let's meet as often as we can. Let's do everything we can in order
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.200]   that we may be built up and God may use us in order to add to the increase of the church."
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.240]   Now, this is something surely that should come to us all at a time like this with great urgency.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:50.000]   Thank God we are still enjoying a kind of peace in this country and in the world.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.480]   Thank God there is no militant persecution of the Christian church here at the present time.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   Thank God we are not exposed to the hazards of bombing and of war and all these other
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.960]   dread possibilities. Thank God, I say, we're having a period of rest and a period of peace.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.880]   But the question, my friend, is this, how are we using it? To what use are we putting it all?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.440]   How are we compared this morning with the church that is being persecuted?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:27.200]   With the church in countries where there is war? How do we compare? If we were like this,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.920]   we would be making much greater efforts. There'd be much greater evidence of edification.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.200]   And of multiplication in this country than in these other lands. What use are we putting these
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   things to? Now, this is, I want to show you, the teaching, the universal teaching of the
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.920]   scripture everywhere. Take the apostle Paul in writing, for instance, to Timothy. He puts it
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.720]   like this in the first epistle in the second chapter. He says, "I exhort, therefore, that first
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:59.120]   of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:05.600]   and for all that are in authority." Why? "That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.040]   godliness and honesty." It's the same thing. He says, "You must pray for these powers that be,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.520]   kings and others, in order that we may be given a measure of peace, in order that we may grow
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.320]   in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord, in order that we may proceed to live this godly life.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.160]   Let's pray for peace and for rest in order that we may be edified." Well now, there it is, I say.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.960]   And surely this exhortation comes to us with an emergency at a time like this.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.200]   How long is this peace to last?
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:48.720]   How long are we to go on with this period of rest and of quiet? I don't know, nobody knows.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.320]   But what I'm asking is this. Are you making full use of the respite?
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.400]   Are you making use of the time you've got? A day may come when war will break forth,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.880]   and we'll all be so busy here and there, we'll have no time. And we'll say, "If only we had more
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.720]   time to read our scriptures and to worship together." But we haven't got it. And then
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.760]   you'll realize that when you had it, you didn't take your opportunity.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.960]   These people took the opportunity. They were given rest, and they used it.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.800]   Who knows? We are not being persecuted now. Who knows? A period of persecution may come
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:33.120]   even in this country. It doesn't need much imagination to see a condition developing
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:41.760]   in which the Roman Catholic Church will again be over all and over the whole world,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.720]   and we know what will happen to evangelical people at such a time.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:54.560]   Are we ready for that? Are we preparing for some of these possibilities that may come to us?
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:01.760]   But above all, there is one thing that's always certain. War may not come,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.440]   persecution may not come, but death will come.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.880]   And you're given an opportunity now to prepare for it.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.880]   It's bound to come. You've got to meet it. But you're enjoying a period of rest and of
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   quiet now. My friend, are you using it? Are you using the time? Let's use the phrase that is here
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   in the scriptures, "Redeeming the time," which means buying up the opportunity. Take it with
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.360]   both hands. While things are quiet, well, there's a period of rest and of calm. I say don't use it
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.920]   just to be slack and to say, "It's all right. We can do that again." Never miss an opportunity.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.280]   Clutch at it. Buy up the opportunity. Redeem the time. The days are evil.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:51.360]   Here were people who had spiritual understanding and insight. And thanking God for a period of
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.880]   rest, they took it with both hands, and they used it for all. They were well. Very well.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.000]   There's the first thing, but let me come to the second. Then let's concentrate on edification.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.160]   "Then at the church's rest threw out all Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified."
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.800]   That's how they made use of the time. In order to be edified, what does that mean?
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.560]   Well, it means to be built up. That's the meaning of the word edification.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:25.840]   It's a great New Testament word. Edification, being built up. Oh, here's the most important
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   thing of all. What's it mean? Well, I can only give you some headings. Work it out for yourselves.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   How does a man become edified? How does a Christian become edified? How does a church
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   become edified? Well, if you're going in for building, and it means that you put up a durable,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.440]   a solid building, where do you start? Foundation. Start to make sure of the foundation.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.160]   There's a kind of foundation laid, yes, but make sure that it's absolutely
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.360]   solid. Put your concrete in. Get it down deep. Make certain of your foundation.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.480]   And these people undoubtedly started with that. Yes, the church always,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:11.120]   in every period of edification, has started with that. I mean by this. I mean this.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:19.680]   We mustn't rest on an experience. We mustn't rest on feelings. Thank God, Father. Thank God
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.800]   for the experience. Thank God for every emotion, every feeling you've ever had. But don't rest on
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:33.360]   that. Make certain of the foundations, which means this, of course, that you become certain
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   of the things that you have believed. When a man believes the gospel, it's only the first step.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.200]   It's just the beginning. That isn't all. He doesn't rest on that. He is very ignorant still.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.080]   He needs a lot of instruction and of enlightenment. If he rests only on his experience and his
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   feelings, something may come and will shake it. Our Lord has taught us all that in the parable of
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:01.200]   the sower and the seed. No, no, the first thing you do now is to make sure that you begin to
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.040]   understand the gospel that you believe, that you get into a condition, again to quote Peter,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.800]   in which you can give a reason for the hope that is in you, that instead of relying only
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   upon this initial work, you now proceed to consider it and to study it. Of course,
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.120]   it means reading your Bible. It means attending preaching of the Word. It means exposition,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.520]   understanding, reading books that will help you to understand. All that is involved. You
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:33.280]   can never be edified without understanding. Very well, let me come on to this. It means this,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.320]   you see, that laying the foundation, you then begin to build upon it.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.800]   And this means an increase in knowledge,
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.720]   an increase in our knowledge of the way and of the plan of salvation.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:55.920]   How little we understand this. I'm thinking, for instance, of what you have seen in the first
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.400]   three chapters of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. There's nothing there but a
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.360]   great exposition of the plan and purpose of God in salvation. Now, a man may be truly converted
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.520]   and be born again and a good Christian, but he's no conception of this great plan of God.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.880]   Now, that's the way to be edified, is to enter into a knowledge and an understanding of that,
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.280]   is to see its various parts and portions, how God has planned it all before the foundation
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.800]   of the world and how it's been put into execution. And suddenly you begin to see this glorious thing
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.560]   and you're amazed. You're being edified, understanding the whole plan and scheme
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.320]   and purpose of salvation. Then you go into the particulars.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:48.160]   You get a clear understanding of justification by faith. There's no more comforting thing than
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.400]   that. There's nothing that'll lead so quickly to edification as just that, to understand the
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.000]   implications of justification by faith only. There are good Christian people who really know nothing
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.400]   about it, and that's why they're so shaky, and that's why they can't stand up to arguments that
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.960]   are presented to them. They want to be edified. They can't help others because they lack the
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.000]   knowledge themselves. Now then, this is edification. Justification, sanctification,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.360]   the glorification that is coming, understanding all this, seeing something of what it means,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.320]   grasping it, taking it in. And then this great phrase, "being in Christ."
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:31.360]   Well, I'm simply throwing out thoughts to you. But my dear friend, if you want to be a solid
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:38.480]   Christian, if you want to be edified, that's the way. When a man begins to see that he's in Christ,
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.800]   that he's no longer in Adam, but he's in Christ and the implications of that.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.760]   Once a man begins to get a glimmering of understanding of Romans 5 and 6,
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.360]   why his whole outlook is changed. He's an entirely different person. He begins to feel at times that
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.600]   he was never saved at all before. It's this edification that's going on. There it is,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.160]   there's a part of it. Adding to knowledge and to understanding. But he doesn't stop at that,
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.920]   of course. It means an increase in the knowledge of God's grace and God's love.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:13.680]   "Knowledge puffeth up," says Paul, "but love, charity edifieth."
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:20.480]   And we must know more and more about this, the love of God to us.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:29.680]   The greatness of his love, his graciousness, his tenderness, his grace. Are you being edified? Are
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:36.400]   you being built up in this? Do you know God better than you did a year ago? Do you know the love of
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:43.200]   God now in a way that you never knew in the past? Can you say with John in his first epistle,
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:52.080]   "We know the love that God hath to us, and we confide in it"? Is the love of God becoming
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.920]   more and more real to you? It's an essential part of edification. You're built up in this knowledge,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:04.720]   practical, experimental knowledge of God and of his grace and of his love. The kind of thing I
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.320]   was referring to last Sunday morning, where you've ceased to limit the Holy One of Israel,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.280]   but are enjoying in more abundant measure his glorious love.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.000]   And then, in addition to that, understanding God's ways.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.160]   This is an essential part of edification, because people are often confused. Take these early
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.480]   Christians. Here they were, they'd believed the gospel, but immediately they were persecuted with
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.200]   this terrible violence, and undoubtedly the devil would come to them and tempt them and say, "Well,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.280]   there you are, that's your Christianity, you see what it's leading to." And at first they wouldn't
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.880]   be able to understand this. But as they were edified, as they were built up in the instruction
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.120]   and in the knowledge, as they gathered together. You remember, you read these early chapters of
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.520]   Acts. They used to meet every day in the various porches of the temple and in other places. In
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.080]   spite of opposition and persecution and hazards, they met together, and they were instructed in
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:05.920]   these things. The ways of God were being expounded to them, and they began to understand why God
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.520]   allowed persecution, and why God does many things in his handling of us. Now, there's nothing more
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.880]   important than that we should be built up in an understanding of the ways of God.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:24.160]   No man will believe instinctively, "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth." You need to be taught that.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.720]   Our instinctive reaction as children is to grumble when things go wrong. We need to be instructive,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:34.320]   and then we'll see that God has to deal with us in many ways in order to bring his great purpose
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.000]   to pass, that all things work together for good to them that love God. Well, now there is something
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.280]   of the mere elements of what is meant by edification. And what is the result of this
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:54.400]   edification? Here it is. It makes you strong. It makes us stable. It makes us reliable.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:01.440]   Until we get this edification, we are children. And what happens to children? Well, the apostle
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.560]   tells the Ephesians. He says, "You mustn't be like children, carried about by every wind of
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.000]   doctrine and the cunning craftiness and the slight of men." That's what happens to children. They
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.280]   believe a thing, then somebody comes with the opposite, and they believe that, and they can't
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.600]   answer. Carried about by every wind of doctrine. But that's only true of children. It's not true
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:30.800]   of the men who's edified. The man who's edified is no longer unstable. He's no longer changeable.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.720]   He's no longer fitful. He's no longer a creature of moods. He's no longer easily discouraged or
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:44.320]   disappointed or shaken or defeated when things go against him. My dear friends, are we edified?
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.640]   How have you reacted to the things that have happened to you during this past year?
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:57.120]   Have you had an illness? Has death visited your family? How did you react to it? How did you
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:04.320]   respond? That's a test of edification. When a man is edified, he's able to stand the strains
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.240]   and the stresses. He knows. He's got this fundamental thing within him. He's right at
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.920]   the center. There's a foundation that cannot be shaken. And so, whatever comes to meet him,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:22.880]   though he feels it, he's ready for it. His faith isn't shaken. He doesn't begin to doubt the
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.440]   goodness and the love of God. He doesn't feel like quitting Christianity. No, no. He's no longer
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.280]   dependent upon circumstances and happenings. He's no longer fearful of what may happen next.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.200]   He's edified. He's built up. He's rooted. He's grounded. He's established in the faith. He's
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.160]   heeded the exhortation of Paul, "Be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:51.200]   Lord." That's it. That's edification. Edification means, you see, that the whole edifice is being
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:57.120]   built up in a solid and in a firm manner on this foundation that can never be shaken.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.560]   The foundation of God standeth sure. There it is. And we're on it. And then we are built up
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.760]   in understanding and in the knowledge of his love and his grace to us. And so, whatever may happen,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:16.800]   we are found to be immovable, reliable, solid Christian people and a church which is the same.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:23.440]   So that though war may come, though persecution may come, we shall not be afraid.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:30.400]   We shall always be found to be steady and steadfast and reliable. Here they are. They
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.960]   make use of the peace to build themselves up. They said, "It's stopped for the moment. It may
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.000]   come back. Are we ready for it? Let's prepare." And so they gave themselves to this business
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.680]   of edification. What else? Well, the time is going. I must just give you my headings.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:52.720]   The last great heading is this, "Maintain the Right Habitual Walk." First Sunday in the new year.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:59.200]   How are you to live this year? Listen. Walk. Walk in the right way. That means go on walking,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.160]   go on living in the right way. Make this the whole character, the whole tenor, the whole trend of
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.720]   your life. Then at the church's rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and we're
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:16.240]   ready for it. And walking. This was the trend of their conversation, of their way of living,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.960]   of their whole attitude in life. Walking how? In the fear of the Lord.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:31.280]   What is this? Well, obviously it isn't a craven fear. This is reverential law. This is what the
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.080]   Old Testament means when it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.800]   And you haven't any wisdom at all until you know something of the fear of the Lord.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.720]   What is it? Well, it's the thing that the Apostle Paul was writing about in that
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.120]   second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 5 and verse 11, which I read at the beginning,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.640]   which puts it like this, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.560]   that we may give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad,
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:06.640]   knowing therefore the fear, the terror of the Lord." What's it mean? Well, it means this,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.080]   that we are always walking as under his eye and in his presence.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:18.480]   Always remember that you are his people. Always remember that he's looking down upon you.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.240]   Always remember that you'll have to give an account of everything you've done in the body,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.560]   whether good or bad. Yes, that's addressed to Christians. That's not to the unbeliever.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.360]   That's the Christian. We all must appear before the judgment throne of Christ,
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.720]   knowing therefore, says Paul, the terror of the Lord. We persuade men.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:46.480]   Every one of us will have to stand before him and look into his blessed face.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   And it's then you realize how you've wasted your opportunities
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.680]   and haven't availed yourselves of the time of peace and of rest.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:08.320]   "In the fear of the Lord." Oh, it's based on love, this. The fear of doing anything displeasing to
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.000]   him, the fear of failing him, the fear of letting him down, the fear that men will misjudge him
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.320]   because of what they see in us. That's what it means, reverence and godly fear.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:26.400]   It's a fear that is the expression of love. Listen then to the way in which the writer
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.440]   of the hymn puts it, "Fear him, ye saints, and you will then have nothing else to fear.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:39.760]   Make you his service, your delight, your wants shall be his care." In other words, it comes to
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   this. A man who lives in the fear of the Lord has no need to be afraid of anybody or anything else.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:55.040]   John Bunyan has that again in a famous hymn, you remember. "Of goblins or foul fiends,
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.760]   it doesn't matter. If you and I are walking in the fear of the Lord," which means that we're
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.680]   afraid of offending him, afraid of sinning against him, afraid of failing him, "if our
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.880]   chiefest desire is to please him and to serve him, well then we've got nothing else to fear because
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.000]   he'll be round and about us. He will keep us, he will guard us, he will guide us with his eye,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.600]   and nothing shall be allowed to harm us. Fear him, ye saints, and you will then have nothing
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.040]   else to fear. Walk in the fear of the Lord as ever realizing that you're under his eye and that
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.000]   nothing matters but your relationship to him." And lastly, the comfort of the Holy Ghost. What's
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.560]   this? Well, it does mean consolation. The Holy Ghost is with us, he's in us as Christians,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.920]   he's in the Church. Very well, let's enjoy his presence, let's enjoy his companionship.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.560]   He'll give you great consolation if you but let him do so.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.680]   He'll bring scriptures to mind, he'll move your heart, he'll testify with you a spirit that you
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:59.760]   are a child of God. Has he ever done that to you? Consolation, the comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.040]   The Spirit beareth witness with our spirits that we are children of God. Do you know that? Well,
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.480]   let him do it. These people walked in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, then his leadings, his promptings.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.680]   This word comfort means that he's a sort of paraclete, he stands by our side,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.760]   he teaches us. Our Lord said, "I'm not going to leave you comfortless, I will send another
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   comforter. He'll guide you, he'll teach you, he'll comfort you, he'll direct you,
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.960]   he'll give you edification." Very well, these people walked in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.680]   What's it mean? Well, let's put it like this. Never grieve him.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:45.840]   Never grieve him by sin or by unworthy thoughts. Never quench him. Never allow anything in you to
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.120]   make you quench the Spirit when he comes and moves you. Don't resist him. Don't grieve him,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:58.800]   don't quench him, don't resist him. But rather, ever be open to him and his gracious influences.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:06.160]   Seek his companionship. Yield yourself to him. Obey his promptings.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:13.520]   Above everything I say, seek his fellowship. Take the benediction, the grace of the Lord
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:21.360]   Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship, the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.600]   He's been sent, he's in us. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of us. Well,
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.720]   he's with us. Give him an opportunity. Listen to him. Take time, my dear friend. You've got peace
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.960]   at the moment. You've got rest. There isn't war, there isn't persecution. Well, spend time in
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:44.640]   listening to him. Have fellowship with him. Have communion with him. Let him speak to you. Speak
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.960]   to him. And thus they walked in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:42:01.360]   And the result was that being thus edified, and being thus blessed of God through the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.040]   and the realization of the nearness of their blessed Lord and Savior,
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.400]   they became such people that others were convicted by merely meeting them.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   And they began to talk to them, and they were able to tell them,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.720]   and thus they were converted. And the church was multiplied, it increased, it went on.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:28.640]   Well, there, very inadequately, is the way in which I suggest to you that every one of us should face
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:36.480]   this gift of a new year. It's the gift of God. Our times are in his hands.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:42.720]   We don't own time. We don't know how much we've got. We don't know how much longer, in any respect.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:52.080]   Redeem the time. Buy up the opportunity. Make use of the period of peace and of rest
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:01.840]   to become edified. Walk in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:11.280]   And as certainly as you do so, God will use you as the means and the instrument and the channel
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:20.800]   of speaking to somebody who's outside, who's seeing in you and in me what it is to be a Christian,
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:30.160]   will begin to inquire of us and will be ready to listen to us. May God give us grace
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:42.320]   to live thus and to walk always in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:43.780]   Amen.
