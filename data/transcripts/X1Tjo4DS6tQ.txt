[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.880]   found in the first epistle of Peter in the second chapter and in the ninth
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.160]   verse. The ninth verse in the second chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.200]   "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:37.080]   people, that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.920]   darkness into his marvelous light." Now that's such a great statement that I
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.480]   don't apologize for reading it again. I'm afraid those of you who are trying to
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.000]   follow it with your Bibles are finding it difficult to do so. I don't think the
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.600]   drummer is quite gone. I think we'd better still have these main lights still in
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.440]   operation. It's a little bit too dark. Thank you. Now let me read it again to
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.600]   you. "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.920]   peculiar people, that in order that ye should show forth his praises who hath
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.960]   called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." Now we are met together
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.480]   on Easter Sunday evening, and this day of course is the day in which Christian
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   people everywhere throughout the world in the church direct their minds and
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.400]   their thoughts and their attention to this amazing, momentous, world-shaking
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.040]   event that took place on that occasion when the Son of God, our Lord and Savior
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:09.120]   Jesus Christ, arose from the dead. Now we meet together, I say, to celebrate a fact.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.800]   There'd be no meeting such as this tonight if he hadn't risen from the dead.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   That's perfectly certain. The records from which we preach make that perfectly
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   plain in and of themselves. You remember how his own disciples were grievously
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.480]   offended by his death. Though he'd told them about it, though he'd warned them
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.520]   that it was coming, they were never able to receive it. You see, they'd seen his
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   miracles. They'd seen the demonstrations of his power, and they couldn't imagine
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.760]   that anyone who had such power indeed that he could even raise the dead should
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.400]   himself die. And the result was that when he was crucified they were quite
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.280]   astounded. They couldn't understand his being arrested so easily, so simply, and
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   his being crucified in apparent, utter weakness. He prophesied that they would
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.920]   all be offended by his death, and they were all offended by his death. His own
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.680]   innermost circle of followers, his own special chosen disciples, they were all
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840]   utterly cast down, crestfallen, disconsolate, miserable, and unhappy. They
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.560]   felt the end had come. We are given a very wonderful account of two of them in
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   the 24th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke. Two of them walking on their
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   way to Emmaus, and they were utterly unhappy and miserable. This is what they
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   said, "We thought that it had been he that would have delivered Israel, that would
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.160]   have brought in the kingdom. We had hoped, we had thought, but they say in effect it
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.880]   was all wrong. He's been crucified, he's died, he's buried." And there they were
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.240]   utterly without hope. Now it's quite clear that all these men then were in
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.440]   such a state and condition that there would never have been any Christianity
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   at all, there would never have been a church, but for one thing, and that was
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   the fact of the resurrection, and his appearances unto them. He had to convince
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.480]   them. Everybody remembers the story of Doubting Thomas. We still talk of
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.280]   Doubting Thomas's. Well, that's just a way of remembering that one of the
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.320]   disciples, even when he was told by the others that the Christ had rarely risen
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.120]   from the dead, said, "I won't believe it until I can put my finger in the marks
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920]   of the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I won't believe it." One of the
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   chosen twelve disciples. No, no, it's quite clear there would never have been a
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.240]   Christian church, there would never have been Christianity, were it not that he
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.400]   literally, actually rose again from the dead in his body and appeared to a
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.520]   number of chosen witnesses, his disciples as I say, and various other chosen
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.840]   witnesses. Very well, we are met together to remind ourselves of this great fact.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.920]   But of course, what is of vital importance is that we should understand
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.600]   something of the meaning and the significance of this fact, and that is
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.080]   the thing to which we must address our minds this evening. What is this? What
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   happened in the resurrection? How do you categorize it? The Bible itself, the New
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.200]   Testament, puts it like this. Take for instance the Apostle Peter, preaching on
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.800]   that day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He expounds it. But what made him preach at
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   all? Well, it was because the people came running together from everywhere to see
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.160]   these extraordinary men and to hear what they've got to say. Why? Well, they say,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.000]   "We hear all these men speaking in our own tongues, in our own language, the
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   wonderful works of God." Now that's it. That's the phrase that helps us to
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.880]   understand the meaning of the resurrection. It is one of those
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.760]   wonderful works of God. It is one of a series of things that God has done for
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   us men and for our salvation. Of course, that's the whole record of the Bible.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.760]   That's what the Bible is. It's a record of the great acts of God. God creating, God
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.720]   choosing a nation for himself, making a nation out of that one man, Abram, God
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   delivering them out of the captivity of Egypt. It's God acting. The Bible's full
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.520]   of the wonderful works of God. Then you come to your New Testament. What's that?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.880]   Well, it's this. When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.080]   made of a woman, made under the law. Wonderful works of God, sending his Son
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.600]   into the world, and so on. Now here is one of those wonderful works of God. This
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   mighty act in which God raised again from the dead his Son that had been
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.080]   crucified and killed and buried at the hands of men. Very well, it's one of these
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.440]   wonderful works of God. And I'm here tonight just to remind you, my dear
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.680]   friends, that this is the Christian message. The Christian message is to tell
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.560]   people about these wonderful works of God. To tell men and women what God has
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.640]   done for us in and through his Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That's the
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.520]   business of preaching. I hope nobody's disappointed. I'm not going to talk about
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.400]   the international situation. I'm not going to get you to sign your names to
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   any protest against anything. I'm here to make a proclamation, an announcement of
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   what God has done. That is the Christian message. That is the Christian gospel. So
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.400]   I say the business of preaching is to do that and to give to him all the praise
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:26.040]   and all the honor and all the glory. That he may show forth the praises of him.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.460]   That's what I'm here to do. Not to give my own opinion on anything at all. I'm to
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:38.920]   show forth his praises, the praises of God. That's the whole function of
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.520]   preaching. And you see, whatever we may think, whatever we may do, whatever we may
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.760]   be, if we are not showing forth his praises, we are not behaving in a
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.440]   Christian manner. We are not doing what we are meant to do. But we are reminded
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.120]   by these words that we're looking at, that this is not only the business and
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.280]   the function of a preacher. It is the primary business and function of every
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.200]   individual Christian believer. Here it is. Peter is describing Christian people. He's
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.600]   writing to members of churches. And this is what he says, "You are a chosen
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.640]   generation. You're a royal priesthood. You're a holy nation. You're a special
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:29.520]   possession of God. What for? That you may show forth his praises, who hath called us
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:39.000]   out of darkness into his marvelous light." Now then, I want to show you this evening
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.600]   in the light of this wonderful phrase. Something of what it means to be a
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.360]   Christian. There's nothing more important in the world than that. The world is
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:01.280]   collapsing round and about us. The world is utterly hopeless. That's not being
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.240]   pessimistic, that's being realistic. Everybody agrees, who thinks at all, that
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.760]   the position couldn't be more desperate. I needn't waste your time in telling you
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.320]   about it. Not only the pollution of the atmosphere with this terrible atomic
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:28.360]   power, but the unthinkable possibility of what may happen. The world is in a crucial,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   desperate position. And the whole message of this Christian gospel is to tell us
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.920]   this, that there is but one hope in a world like that, and that is to become
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.480]   one of these people of God. In other words, to become a Christian. Surely I
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.800]   needn't take time in demonstrating that. Do you know of any other hope? Do you
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.840]   know of any other teaching, any other philosophy, any other point of view that
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.720]   gives you any hope whatsoever this evening? There's none at all. But this
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.480]   does. We've been looking at this, some of us who meet here Sunday by Sunday, I'm
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.400]   actually calling attention to this paragraph in this second chapter of the
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.040]   first epistle of Peter for the tenth time tonight. We've been examining the
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.360]   first twelve verses of this chapter, and here I say we do it for the tenth time.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.080]   And this is what I want to emphasize once more. The Apostle tells us, "Behold I lay
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.160]   in Zion," he's quoting from the Old Testament, "the chief cornerstone, elect
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.840]   precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded." I wouldn't be in
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.820]   this pulpit if that were not true. I'm here to proclaim this, that when the
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.000]   world is collapsing round and about us, it is possible for a man who's a
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   Christian never to be confounded, never to be surprised, never to be disappointed,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.920]   never to be put to shame, never to be taken unawares, always to understand, and
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.440]   always to have some resources that no one else knows anything about, never be
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.360]   confounded. Here it is. But you see, this is only possible to one who's a
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.720]   Christian. And therefore, what is more important than that we should know
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.880]   exactly what a Christian is? Now, we are told many things about him here, I come
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   to this last one this evening. What we are told here is this, that you can define
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.960]   the Christian, and therefore you can decide whether you are a Christian in
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:34.120]   this way. No one makes himself a Christian. That's impossible. A Christian
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.640]   is one who shows forth his praises, not his own. You see how important this is.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.440]   There are many people who think that a Christian is just a good man. Well, if a
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.680]   Christian is just a good man by living his life, whose praises is he showing
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.800]   forth his own? What a good man he is, they say. They give him the praise, and
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.040]   they're right. He's doing it all himself, just a good man. Yes, but you see, he's
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   not a Christian by definition. Why is it that men and women still go on imagining
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.680]   and thinking that they make themselves Christians? Some of them tonight think
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.960]   they're making themselves Christian by holding certain views, certain views
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.600]   about bombs and about war and things like that. They think that makes them
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   Christian. Others think that what makes them Christian is the
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:32.920]   good they do, the sins they avoid, the way they live, and they think that that makes
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:40.400]   them Christian. But you see, the praise goes to them. But by definition here, we
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.600]   are told that when a man's a true Christian, the praise doesn't go to him,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:51.080]   it goes to God. Now, let me sum it all up. I read that portion at the beginning in
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.880]   order that I might read to you that great statement of the Apostle Paul. He
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:03.600]   says, look here, we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus. We are not our
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.560]   own workmanship. A man doesn't make himself a Christian. He's got nothing to
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.720]   boast of at all, not of works, lest any men should boast. But you see, the whole
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.200]   tragedy is this evening, that people are still thinking of Christians in terms of
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.680]   their own works. The Christian a good man, a moral man, a nice man. He is all that,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.600]   but you can be all that without being a Christian at all. The first thing that's
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.400]   obvious is that no man makes himself a Christian. It is God who makes us
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:41.280]   Christian. Well, let me put it like this to you. A Christian is a man who can only
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:49.920]   be explained in terms of what God has done to him, that he should show forth
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:57.600]   his praises, who hath called you out of darkness, into his marvelous light. I
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:04.960]   never tire of this view of the Christian. It's so plain in the New Testament, it's
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.640]   so plain in the subsequent history of the Christian Church. When a man is a
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.040]   Christian, he becomes something of an enigma and a problem to everybody else,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:22.320]   to all who are not Christian. They can't understand him. They say, "What's happened to him?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.120]   What is this?" They can understand everything else. They can understand a
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.720]   man belonging to a particular political party. They can understand a man changing
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   his party. There's no problem about that. People do things like that and they can
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.520]   give reasons for it. But you see, when a man becomes a Christian, they can't
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:46.440]   understand him. There's only one explanation of the Christian and that is
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   God, what God has done to him. "You are what you are," says the Apostle, "that in
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.360]   order that you may show forth his praises, who hath called you out of
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:05.840]   darkness, into his marvelous light." My dear friends, I trust we're examining
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.200]   ourselves as I go forward. Can you understand yourself? Can other people
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:18.260]   understand you? If they can, you're not a Christian. What proves that a man's a
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:24.120]   Christian is this, that one has to call in God as the only adequate explanation.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   And then the third thing that's here so plainly and obviously is this, that the
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:40.440]   Christian, therefore, in all he is and in all he does, is one who shows forth the
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.120]   praises of God. Now the Apostle is very concerned about this. The Apostle Peter,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   the Apostle Paul, he says exactly the same thing. Listen to him putting it like
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.480]   this in the third chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians and in the tenth verse.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.360]   He says that he's been made a preacher, "unto me you am less than the least of all
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.920]   saints. Is this grace given, this grace of ministry? What for? Well, he says that I
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.360]   should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.800]   make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.920]   of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ, to
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:29.120]   the intent," here's the object, "that now unto the principalities and powers in
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.920]   heavenly places might be made known by the church through the medium of the
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:44.880]   church," what? "the manifold wisdom of God." God shows his manifold wisdom to the
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.080]   principalities and the powers in the heavenly places in and through what he's
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.040]   done to the Christian Church. Did you notice there was another expression of
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.280]   it in that second chapter of the Ephesians which we read at the beginning,
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.600]   that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace, how?
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:16.560]   In his kindness toward us by or through Christ Jesus. Very well I deduce from
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.200]   that this proposition, that a Christian is a man who in everything that he is
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:29.120]   and does shows forth the praises of God. Now what does this mean? How does he do
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.680]   it? Well let me put it to you like this.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   That says the apostle here that he should show forth, proclaim, broadcast the
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:50.000]   praises of God. This is what a Christian is, this is what a Christian does. The man
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.800]   as he is and in all his activities and in all his behavior, he's a broadcaster
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:03.840]   of the praises of God. People look at him and they don't say what a wonderful man
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:11.120]   he is, they say how wonderful God is. You know our Lord did that. You read the
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.280]   Gospels and you'll find this, that after he'd performed certain miracles we are
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:24.080]   told the people give praise to God. They said we've seen strange things today.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.760]   Who is this they said, that God has given such great power unto him. They looked at
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.680]   him but they didn't stop even at him. He suggested to them the power of God and
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:43.520]   they feared and they glorified God that had given such power unto men. Well now
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.080]   this is to be true of the Christian always. Very well what are we to show
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:57.160]   forth? Well we're to show forth I say not ourselves but his praises. What does this
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.680]   mean? Well let me give you certain other words which would translate this word
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:12.440]   equally well. His virtues, his excellences, his eminent qualities, his
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:20.240]   perfections, his triumphs. This is the Christian, this is what a Christian does.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:28.880]   A Christian is a man who shows forth the virtues, the excellences, the eminent
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:38.040]   qualities, the perfections, the triumphs of God. No that's how we are to think of a
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.440]   Christian. "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:53.000]   people. That ye should show forth his excellences who hath called you out of
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.920]   darkness into his marvelous light." How does the Christian do this? Well let me
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:07.480]   suggest some answers such as this. What God has done in Christ for the Christian
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:15.280]   and in order to make us Christian does this. That's the first thing. Here am I as
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.840]   a Christian how do I show the forth the praises of God? Well the first thing is
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.080]   this, the very fact that I am a Christian at all. How have I become a Christian? And
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:30.320]   that leads me to say what God has done in Christ for me and in order to make me
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.160]   a Christian is the most glorious revelation and manifestation of the
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.320]   excellences, the virtues, the eminent qualities, the character, the attributes
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:48.040]   of the Almighty God. Now this is Christianity. See Christianity doesn't
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.600]   start with men, it always starts with God. Christianity is not an account of what
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.520]   men have done, it's what God has done. It's always the excellences, the
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.240]   character of God that is displayed in this. You see that's what makes this
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.120]   different from every religion, from every moral teaching. I said all this this
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   morning, I'm saying it again tonight, because people still have this terrible
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.520]   illusion. It's God my friends. Christianity is the revelation of the
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.080]   character of God, not of any man. Now then what do I mean? Well I mean something like
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.520]   this, what God I say has done for us in and through our Lord Jesus Christ. What's
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.720]   he done? How does the Lord Jesus Christ display to me the character of God, his
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.680]   excellences, his virtues? Well the first thing it displays to me is the grace of
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:42.760]   God. What are the attributes of God? What are the characteristics of God? Well here's
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:51.840]   the first thing, the grace of God. What is grace? Well grace means favor shown to
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:00.040]   somebody who's utterly undeserving of it. Grace means kindness shown to a man who
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.880]   deserves nothing but punishment and retribution. It's a very difficult word
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:11.200]   to define. It's a word that can only be used rarely of God. The grace of God. Did
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.400]   you notice it in that reading in Ephesians 2, "By grace are he saved," how he
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:21.200]   goes on repeating it, "the exceeding riches of his grace." What am I talking
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:32.960]   about? Oh what I mean is this. Why has God ever troubled about us at all? Look at
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:42.080]   the world as it is tonight. Is this the world that God made? No it isn't. It is
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:51.320]   and it isn't. God made a perfect world. There was no imperfection in it. There
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.920]   was no sin. There was no blemish. He looked upon it himself and he saw that
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.400]   it was all good. He finally crowned his creation by making men and he made him
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.520]   in his own image. He made him upright. He made him righteous. He put him into a
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:11.280]   place called paradise. That's what life was meant to be. Why is it as it is then?
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.080]   Why is our world what it is this evening? Why have we got these horrible bombs
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.200]   being made? Why will the nations not come together and agree to banish war? Why is
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   there misery and unhappiness? Why is there immorality and vice and people
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.480]   separating, homes being torn to tatters and little children being deprived of
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.160]   the love of father and mother? Why drunkenness? Why all the heartbreak?
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:44.600]   What's it all due to? Well it's all due to the sin of men. Men in his folly raised
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   himself against God and rebelled and said that he could work things better in
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   his own way and listen to the tempter and down he went and brought everything
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   down with him. Now this is where grace comes in. Why does God bother about us at
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.240]   all? What do we deserve from God? What do you deserve from God? What do I deserve
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   from God? How often have we all put God on one side in order that we might do
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.560]   what we wanted to do. When God spoke to you in your conscience he silenced him.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:21.320]   The Almighty God, the creator of everything, you dismissed him. That's
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:28.200]   rebellion. And the whole world is guilty before him. And the world deserves
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.760]   nothing but all it's getting. And you see that is the explanation of the world
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.600]   tonight. God's allowing the world that's turned its back upon him to reap the
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.920]   consequences of its own cleverness, its own action. That's why the world is as it
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:54.200]   is and that's all it deserves and much worse. But God is a God of grace. And
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:01.040]   instead of consigning this rebellious fallen world to perdition or allowing it
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.360]   to stew in its own juice and to putrefy itself into a stench that is
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:18.280]   indescribable, God looked down upon the world. Even when men first sinned, God
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:26.400]   came down and spoke to him. What made him do it? Oh, the grace of God, the
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.080]   excellencies, one of his excellencies, one of his virtues, one of his attributes.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:37.960]   God is grace. In spite of us and all we deserve, he's looked upon us and he's
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:43.680]   done something about us. You see, in these wonderful works of God leading to the
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.760]   resurrection, God's displaying his own character, his own excellences, his
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.440]   praises, his virtues. And the first of them and the thing that leads to
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.800]   everything else is this wonderful thing which we call grace. The exceeding
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   riches of his grace. But let me go on. What else do I find in God? I find mercy.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:20.840]   I find pity. And this again is something that is displayed so wonderfully in all
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:26.400]   he's done for us in his Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Let me put it in the
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.320]   word kindness. Let me read to you again Ephesians 2 7. He's done this, that and
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.920]   the other to us, says Paul, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.200]   together with Christ by grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together, and
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.440]   made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in order
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:51.280]   that, what, in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:28:04.080]   in his kindness toward us. God is kind. God is kind. God is full of pity and of
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.960]   mercy and of compassion and of kindness. What does this mean? What's the difference
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:17.040]   between this and grace? Well let me put it to you like this. It's something you
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.800]   see that is shown, if you like, in the parable of the prodigal son. That foolish
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.200]   boy who demanded his rights and his share of the estate and who left his home and
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.400]   his father to have his good time, made an awful mess of things. And there he is
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:45.000]   seated in the far country in the field with a swine and the husk. Oh. But his
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.680]   father was sorry for him. He knew he'd come back and when he came back, instead
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.200]   of lecturing him, he threw his arms around him. He was sorry to see the boy, his own
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.840]   boy, in such a pitiful, pitiable condition. Mercy. That's what mercy means, that God
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:11.520]   seeing our misery, feels sorry for us, has compassion upon us. That's why he sent
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.120]   his son into this world. God in his glory looked down upon earth and he saw not
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:23.840]   only the folly of men in sin, he saw his misery, his unhappiness, his wretchedness.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:32.400]   And God felt sorry for men. His heart went out in pity and in compassion, in
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.040]   mercy. And it's because of that that he did all that he did. Again let me quote
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.120]   you this apostle, this same apostle. He puts it all so perfectly. Here he is in
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.000]   the epistle to the Romans, chapter 5, verse 6. "When we were yet without
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.440]   strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly. Yet far scarcely for a righteous
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.760]   man will one die. Yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.320]   God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.360]   for us. He saw us without strength, without hope, in utter helplessness and misery.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:13.000]   And he had mercy and compassion, his kindness toward us." All this is shown by
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.040]   what he's done for us in Christ. It shows forth his praises, his excellences, his
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.280]   attributes. You look at Christ and you say, "Oh how kind God must be, how
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.480]   merciful God must be. Why is he ever troubled? Why has he ever done anything?"
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:39.240]   That's why. But let's go on. What else is there in God? Oh wisdom. God is eternal
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:48.600]   wisdom. God is wisdom. And there is nowhere where the wisdom of God is shown
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:55.000]   so clearly as in what he has done for us in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.920]   Christ. I've already quoted to you Ephesians 3.10, "That now unto the
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:05.800]   principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known through the church
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:16.080]   the manifold wisdom of God." God is all-wise, he's omniscient, he sees
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.960]   everything, he knows everything. But beyond all that there is the wisdom of
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.560]   God. Now then, how is this shown in what he's done for us in the Lord Jesus
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:32.360]   Christ? Well, I can put it to you like this. Do you know the greatest problem
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:38.080]   that there's ever been in this universe? What would be your answer if I put that
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:46.400]   as a question to you? What is the single greatest problem that has ever arisen in
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:56.600]   this universe? Is it the creation of the world? No. There was nothing there? You say
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.440]   that must be the greatest problem, therefore. How can God produce a world
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.840]   out of nothing? That's nothing to God. All he had to do was to say, "Let there be
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:12.400]   light," and there was light. What is the greatest single problem that this world
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:20.120]   has ever known? Is it to lend a man on the moon? No, no. They'll probably do that
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:27.240]   before long. These things about which we get so excited, they're very small things
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   these. Within the competence and the power of men, oh, I needn't waste your time.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.080]   What's the greatest single problem? I'll tell you what it is. The greatest single
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:47.880]   problem in the whole universe is this. How can God forgive a sinful and a
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.200]   rebellious man? Oh, but you see, that's no problem at all, for God is love. Quite
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.840]   simple. Love does it all. What a matter what man does, because God is love. He
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.320]   says, "It's all right, I forgive you." But my dear friend, you're very wrong if you
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.440]   think that. You don't understand God. You don't know about the excellences of God.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.960]   You don't know his virtues. You're ignorant of his praises. For God is love,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:20.280]   I agree, but God is not only love. God is just. God is holy. God is righteous. God is
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.440]   light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:35.240]   God can't dwell with sin. Sin and God are eternal opposites, and he can't dwell
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.400]   with it. The problem of forgiveness is the greatest problem in the whole
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.120]   universe. There's never been a greater, there never will be a greater. Here is
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.720]   the whole problem, I say, confronting God. How can God forgive men and still remain
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.160]   God? How can God remain just and righteous and holy, and yet forgive me, a
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.560]   rebel and a sinner? How can he do it? How can God reconcile men to himself and
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:11.600]   still remain with his character inviolate? That's the problem. And you
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   know the Bible is nothing but an account of how God has solved the problem. And
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:22.280]   it's the most amazing thing in the universe. You might say this, "God made
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.640]   men, made a perfect world, men sinned and rebelled, it's all gone wrong. What can
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.920]   God do? Let's wipe it out, start again, could make another creation." But you see
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.360]   that wouldn't have solved it. Why? For this reason. If he'd done that, he'd have
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.840]   made another, it would have been perfect, yes, but the first was perfect. The first
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.320]   was absolutely perfect, but it failed. It listened to the tempting of the devil,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.520]   and down it went. If God made another world and another perfect man, down it
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:55.360]   would go again. He wouldn't solve the problem that way. There was only one way,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:04.840]   and it takes the wisdom of God to see it and to conceive of it. It is this, that
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:12.680]   God should send his own Son into this world. God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:21.080]   three persons in one Godhead, the three dwelling in eternity. They made man. God
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.400]   the Father planned, made everything through the Son, through the
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.360]   instrumentality of the Holy Spirit. That's how everything was made, and man,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.320]   he said, "Let us make men in our own image." But man, they say, has failed, and here's
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:42.560]   the problem. What can be done? The Father sees the only way. It is to send his Son
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.240]   the second person in the Trinity into this world in order to redeem it, and in
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.520]   order to rescue men. And the Son volunteered. He said, "Here am I. Send me."
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:36:01.760]   And so, when the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.360]   woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. You look at the
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.200]   baby in Bethlehem, what you say, "Oh, how wonderful, how sweet, how beautiful. My friend, have you
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   seen the wisdom of God there?" That's the wisdom of God. God found a way. He's making
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.920]   a new man, and that his own Son, the start of a new humanity, the wisdom of
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:30.280]   God. But he not only sent him into this world, he made him under the law. This is
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.680]   God's way of solving the problem of forgiveness. God's law must be honored. No
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.880]   man had ever done so. Not a single man in the Old Testament had ever honored the
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.320]   law of God. Not only did Adam fall and fail, all subsequent to him fell. The very
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:52.240]   best men are all sinners. The Old Testament tells you that. But God's law
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:00.480]   must be honored. And here is the first who's ever done so. Tempted in all points
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.360]   like as we are, yet without sin, God, man, and he honors the law of God and vindicates
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.920]   it. Yes, but he hasn't finished yet. What about the devil who got the first men
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.400]   down? He tempts him, but he can meet him. He routs him, he defeats him. "Get thee
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.320]   behind me," he says, and the devil has to go. He repulses him in spite of all his
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:29.880]   malignity and all his power. He defeated the devil. But what about the sins that
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.520]   you and I have committed? The fact that Christ has honored the law of God
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.960]   doesn't help me because I've sinned and my record is there against me. I am
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.600]   guilty before God and his holy law. What can be done about it? Here's the only
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:52.160]   answer. This Son of God, who has become Son of Man as well, takes my sins, my guilt
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:58.520]   upon him, and God punishes it in him. And having punished it in him, he can give me
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:06.160]   free forgiveness. He is just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:15.120]   And so God has found a way whereby he can remain just as he always has been
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:22.720]   and still forgive me and reconcile me unto himself. This is the wisdom of God.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:29.600]   Listen to the hymn writer putting it. "O loving wisdom of our God, when all was
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:35.440]   sin and shame, a second or done to the fight until the conflict came." Yes, it's
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.360]   the loving wisdom of God. What do you see when you look at Christianity? Do you see
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.240]   good men not committing their sin, doing little bits of good, marching in their
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.080]   protest? Oh, the monstrosity of it all. Turn away from men. Look at him, the
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:57.160]   excellencies of God, the loving wisdom of our God. Have you seen it? That's what
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.640]   it's meant to show, that we might show forth the praises of him who hath called us
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.880]   out of darkness into his marvelous light. But what else is there? Well, think of the
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:17.440]   love of God. Where do I see it? Well, I take you again to the same place. If you
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.800]   want to know anything about the love of God, you go and look at that cross on
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:30.960]   Calvary's hill. What's happening there? Well, I've told you. God is punishing his
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:40.840]   own son with the punishment that you and I deserve. That's what he's doing. That's
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:49.960]   the measure of the love of God. Listen to Paul putting it in Romans 8.32, in an
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:40:02.720]   incomparable statement. "He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:11.640]   us all." That's what he did. He spared him nothing. Everything in the wrath of God
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:18.240]   that you as sin and mine deserve, he poured it upon him. He didn't keep
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.680]   anything back because he was his son. He didn't spare him. He gave him up. He gave
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:29.640]   him over to bear the punishment, and he poured it upon him. There's the measure
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.320]   of the love of God. That because you and I may be delivered and reconciled and
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:43.560]   forgiven and restored, God sacrifices his own son. Behold the Lamb of God that
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:51.800]   taketh away the sin of the whole world. That's where you see the love of God.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.120]   When you look at the Son of God being delivered up for you a death, and smitten
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   and stricken by his own father in order that you and I might be forgiven. But I
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:09.480]   come to the last word here, and it is of course the word "power." What is God? What
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.280]   are the attributes of God? Yes, there is grace in God. There is kindness, mercy,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:25.800]   compassion, pity. There is love. There is wisdom. But God is omnipotent. God is all
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:31.680]   powerful. He is the creator and the sustainer of everything that is. The
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:41.760]   omnipotent God. But if you want to know anything about the omnipotence of God,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:49.120]   you've got to look at what he did in his son when he raised him from the dead. Did
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.040]   you notice how Paul put it again in that portion I read to you at the beginning?
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.560]   Here he is writing to these Ephesian Christians. He says, "You know, I'm
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.000]   praying for you. I'm praying that the eyes of your understanding might be
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.280]   enlightened, that you may know." What? Well, what is the hope of his calling?
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.200]   Secondly, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. And
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:19.400]   thirdly, what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe? Well,
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.640]   what is that power? Says Paul, "I wish you knew God's power towards you who
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.000]   believe. I wish you knew something of the power of God that can work in you and
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.600]   that has already worked in you." Well, how can I give a comparison? He says, "Here it
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   is, according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.440]   when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.800]   places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.320]   name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come."
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:58.240]   That's it. That's greater power than the power in the creation. It's the greatest
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.560]   power God has ever shown. What's he done? He's conquered the devil, he's conquered
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.400]   death, he's conquered hell. The mightiest forces in the universe next to God
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.920]   himself, but God is greater. He brought his Son up again from the dead. He burst
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.600]   us under the bands of death. Even death and hell can't contain him and hold him
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:27.460]   back because the power of God raises him up. So the thing you and I ought to see
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:34.920]   this Easter Sunday night as we look at the resurrection is this. Is the power of
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:44.440]   God the power that has conquered every enemy including the last enemy himself
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:53.880]   itself which is death and the grave? My friends men and women you and I will
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.000]   soon be dead, perhaps buried in a grave, doesn't matter whether it's in a grave
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.760]   or blown to nothing by an atomic bomb. You've got to face this. Is there a power
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.360]   that can take you through it? There's one and one only, the power that brought
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:18.380]   Christ up from the dead. Thereby God has given a display of his everlasting and
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:25.560]   almighty power, don't you see? That in all that God has done in Christ he is
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:31.280]   setting forth, showing forth his praises, his own excellences, his eminent
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:41.160]   qualities, his attributes, his virtues, yes, his invincibility, his triumph. This is
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:50.240]   Christianity but let me say just a word under another heading. God shows forth
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.960]   his excellences not only in what he's done in Christ for us, he shows it
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:02.000]   equally in what he has done in us as the result of what he's done in Christ.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.440]   You're getting excited says somebody, of course I am. Aren't you excited? Can you
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.080]   speak of things like this without being excited? Men and women why are we not all
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.480]   standing on our feet praising God? What he's done in us as the result of what
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.960]   he's done in and through his own Son. What's he done? Well Peter summarizes it
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.800]   like this, "He has called us out of darkness into his most marvelous light."
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:35.400]   What's he mean by this? Well let me tell you something of it. Next to the problem
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:44.760]   of forgiving men the greatest problem is to change men. Your world will be as it
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:51.520]   is until men and women are changed. Not until then. Why are they building the
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.600]   bombs? Because they're evil, because they're sinful. Oh but you say that's it
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.800]   these nations and I protest against bombs. But my dear friend the very self
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.920]   same thing that's in the nations and that makes them do that is in you and
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.440]   makes you do similar things. Why don't these two big nations come together?
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:15.860]   Pride, jealousy, envy, each one standing. I test, I test, up and up they go, testing
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.920]   testing which is to be the greatest. But that's what men and women are doing
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.560]   isn't it? That's their attitude towards their neighbors. Which is the better
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.120]   house? Which is the better car? Whose children are doing best? Same thing. It's
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.040]   evil sin in the human heart. And you see the world is as it is because man's
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.880]   become rotten. He's sinful, he's vile and he must be changed. There's no hope until he is.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:47.160]   And here's a problem. How to change men? Oh education. You still believe that
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.840]   nonsense? That's not denouncing education. Education is a good thing. But if you
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.800]   think education can change a man, go and think again. Read your newspaper. Some of
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   the most educated men are drunkards tonight. They're adulterers. They're
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.680]   everything that a man shouldn't be. But very knowledgeable, very learned, very
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.480]   able. That can't do it. Everything else you can mention. I can say the same thing
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:13.160]   about it. Here's the problem. Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:22.400]   his spots? Can that which is crooked be made straight? That's your problem. The
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.480]   disciples put it very well on one occasion. A certain rich young ruler came
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:35.880]   to our Lord and he said, "What must I do that I might inherit the kingdom of God?"
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.800]   "All right," said our Lord, "you know the commandments. Thou shalt not commit adultery,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.040]   thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, etc., etc."
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.640]   And the young man replied saying, "All these have I kept and observed from my
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:48:00.200]   youth up." And our Lord looked at him and said, "One thing thou lackest. Go sell all
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:05.960]   that thou hast and give unto the poor and come take up the cross and follow me."
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:15.000]   And he went away sorrowful. And the disciples seeing him going away turned
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.160]   to our Lord and said, "Who then can be saved?" Here's a good, excellent, moral,
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.840]   religious young man. He goes away sorrowful. He can't do it. Who can be
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:35.200]   saved? Is it possible for anybody to be saved? Here's the question. And there's
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.640]   only one answer to it, the answer that our Lord gave the disciples on that
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:46.040]   occasion. With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:51.800]   possible. It is only God who can save. How does he do it? Well, he convicts us. Who
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.600]   can convict the men of his sin? There is no power on earth that can do it. Who can
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.840]   convict men and women of the evil of their ways, the folly of their ways, the
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:08.800]   wrongness, the sinfulness, the vileness of their ways? Nobody can do it. Argument
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.080]   can't do it. Reason can't do it. Eloquence can't do it. The tenderest appeals of
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.920]   heart and head can't do it. The most loving persons in the world can't do it.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.880]   You see them failing with some poor alcoholics? He knows himself he's wrong.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.280]   His wife and children in their rags and tatters are appealing to him. They can't
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.160]   persuade him. The doctors, the Royal College of Physicians, issues a report.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.280]   Is that going to do it? On smoking, alcohol, or anything else? Of course it
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.800]   isn't. They haven't sufficient power. How can you convict a man? There's only one
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.040]   power in the universe that can convict a man of sin and show him his evil and
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.200]   create within him a desire to be new. What is it? It's the power of the Holy
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:50:02.120]   Ghost that was sent by the Lord Jesus Christ, risen from the dead. Listen again
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:12.880]   to Paul in Ephesians 2. "You hath he quickened, God, who were dead in
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:18.600]   trespasses and sins, wherein he walked in times past according to the course of
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:23.120]   this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.720]   dwelleth in the children of disobedience, wherein we all had our conversation in
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:33.040]   times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.720]   of the mind, and were the children of wrath, even as others." That's the whole
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:42.920]   description of entire mankind. That's man. That's life. That's the world tonight.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:51.560]   That's how people are living. What can change them? Oh, there's only one answer.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:58.160]   It needs the power of God to quicken, to put life into us. Spiritually dead,
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.360]   rebels under the wrath of God, but he can do it. With God, nothing shall be
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.560]   impossible, and he quickens men, puts life into them, gives them understanding,
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.640]   convicts them of their sin, and then he changes them. Regeneration. They become
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.120]   newborn babes. They have new life. A new creation comes into being. They're given
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:27.680]   new natures, a new heart, a new start, a new everything. And all this, you see,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:39.480]   shows the praises of God. A Christian is not merely a good man, he's a new man. And
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.000]   as you look at this new man, you don't say what a wonderful man he is. You say,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.160]   what power can have done it? What God can have done it? What a power! You shall
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:55.880]   thought the excellences and the praises of God. If ever there was an example of
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:03.840]   this, it was the Apostle Paul. There he was, a proud, self-satisfied, self-righteous
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:10.400]   Pharisee, persecuting the Church of Christ, who would ever have expected to
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.480]   see him as an Apostle and a preacher. What a change, what a transformation! What
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.160]   did it? There's only one answer. He gives it himself in the first chapter of his
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:26.440]   first epistle to Timothy. "I obtained mercy. I did it," he says, "in ignorance, in
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:32.840]   unbelief, but I obtained mercy, the compassion, the grace, the kindness, and
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:43.160]   the mercy of God." So you see, a Christian, by being a new and a changed man, shows
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:53.120]   forth the excellences, the praises, the triumphs of God. What civilization and
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   willpower and education and politics and the whole world have failed to do, God in
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:08.760]   Christ has done. He's quickened us. He has raised us up together with him. He's
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.880]   caused us to be seated in the heavenly places. We are new creatures. All things
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:25.360]   have passed away, and behold, all things have become new. And for me to close, the
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:32.100]   Christian shows forth the excellences of God in this, by not only what God has
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:37.280]   already done in him, but by what God is still doing in him, and by what God will
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   continue to do in him. What's that? Well, he grows. As newborn babes that desire
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:50.920]   desire the sincere milk of the word, that he may grow thereby. God doesn't merely
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:57.180]   give to bring to birth and stop. He goes on giving food, sustenance, leading to
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:04.320]   growth. He sanctifies us. He keeps us. Who are you? Listen to Peter. He says that he
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:11.080]   is writing to those who are saved as the result of, listen to him, "Blessed be the
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.880]   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.960]   hath begotten us again, and to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:28.120]   from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:34.040]   fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept, kept by the power of
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.880]   God, through faith and through salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time." He
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:45.680]   keeps us. He enables us to fight temptations. How can I meet the devil?
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.880]   There's only one answer. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Take
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.800]   unto you the whole armor of God. How can I stand up to adverse circumstances? How
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.280]   can I meet the bombs and the end of the world? Oh, he can give me the peace of God
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:12.320]   which passes all understanding. I shall never be confounded. Songs of praises I
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:22.720]   will ever give to thee. Have you started doing it? If you are not praising God
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.120]   tonight from the depth of your heart, above everything else in the world, you
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.880]   don't know him. And take it from me, you're not a Christian. A Christian is a man who
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:44.480]   says, "I am what I am, by the grace of God." If you don't know him, if you're not
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.000]   praising him, if you don't attribute everything tonight to what God has done
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:55.520]   in Christ for you, I say face the fact of your coming death and your final
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:02.440]   hopelessness and your everlasting despair, and then turn to him and believe
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:08.240]   in him and ask him to give you some indication, some
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:13.920]   manifestation of his grace, his love, his kindness, his mercy, his compassion, his
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   wisdom, his love, his power. And he'll raise you up and make a new man, a new
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:26.680]   woman of you. And you'll be able to face whatever the future may hold, knowing
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:33.760]   certainly that you'll never be confounded. Amen.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
