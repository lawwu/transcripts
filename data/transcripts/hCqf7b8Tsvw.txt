[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   On Easter Sunday we celebrated the resurrection of Christ. He is the victor,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   He has defeated sin and Satan and death itself. It's one of the sweetest weekends
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   of the year for the Church. And then Monday morning hits, and many of us
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   return to work, and the reality of sin and Satan and death greet us in the morning.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Pastor John, how do we live out the victory of Easter Sunday on Monday?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   That's right. I have ringing in my ears kind of the reverse of the famous sermon.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Several people have preached it, where you have the refrain over and over,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   "It's Friday, but Sunday's coming." And now you're asking me the question,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   "It's Sunday, but Monday's coming." And we need both of those theologies, don't we?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I mean, we need the theology to get us from Friday to Sunday, but we also need,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   in this age, the theology that helps us realize our Sundays are so often followed
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   by Mondays. And here's what I find the most helpful. We need a clear, biblical picture
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   of what this age is like, and what the expectations are that we can have
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   as redeemed children of God. And here's a couple of passages that include
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   the word "groaning" that I had not seen before recently. In 2 Corinthians 5,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   it says, "While we are still in this pit," meaning these fallen bodies that are prone
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   to get sore throats and pneumonia and cancer and wounds, "While we're still in this body,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   we groan, not that we would be unclothed." In other words, nobody wants to be bodiless,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   he says. We want to be super clothed, overclothed, swallowed up by life.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then he says, "God has prepared us for that, who has given us His Spirit now as an,"
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and then it's usually translated "guarantee." The literal word is "downtainment."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   That's really important. I have a downpayment, which has a double-stored edge, doesn't it?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It means only a downpayment, and it means really a downpayment. The "only" means
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm not all the way redeemed yet, which leads me over there to Romans 8.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   That's the one I'm more familiar with, where it says, not only the creation,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   but we ourselves who have the first fruits. Now that's the same as guarantee or downpayment,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   it's the same idea. First fruits, not the whole harvest, just the first fruits of the Spirit,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and we groan inwardly. So over in 2 Corinthians 5, we in this tent are groaning,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   though we have a downpayment of the Holy Spirit, and in Romans 8, 23-25,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   we're groaning inwardly, though we have the first fruits of the Spirit.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So the picture there of the era in which we live is the painful reality of the already downpayment,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and not yet of the full harvest and the full payment. So getting that straight,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   that all the struggles of this life, of the Monday mornings after the High Easter,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   are to be expected. They're to be expected. This is the way God has set it up,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   that we groan here. So here's my strategy for Monday morning.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Number one, don't forget Good Friday and Easter. Fix your heart as you wake up in the morning,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   every day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, all the way through, on the fact that whether I feel it or not,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and whether the evidence is around me convincing me of it or not, the cross means I'm loved.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And Easter means that love is victorious, and He will not stop loving me because the highest cost
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   has been paid to obtain me for Himself. That's number one. Number two, He really is with me on Monday.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Whether I feel it or not, He said so in Matthew 28-20. I will be with you to the end of the age.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So believe that. Whether you're high or low, He's with me because He's risen from the dead
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and He's alive to help me wherever I am, in whatever situation I am.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And then the last thing is, and it kind of gets us back to where we started, like Sunday's coming,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   savor the final great revelation of what happened.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Jesus said, "When you're persecuted and reviled and slandered, rejoice in that day,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   for great is your reward in heaven." So I think we Christians should often think about our reward.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That is, think about the resurrection. Think about the fact that I'm going to get a new body someday.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I won't sin more someday. I won't have any more pain and depression any more someday.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It really is coming. He really will be everything to me someday.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Jesus says, "If that's real to you, you'll be able to rejoice now,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   right in the middle of the Monday morning's affliction."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
