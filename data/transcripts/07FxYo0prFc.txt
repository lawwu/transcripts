[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.120]   - All right, welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.280]   I'm here with Peyton Manning.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.040]   Man, it's an honor to have you on here, bro.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.020]   I think I told you this when we met at the arena,
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.160]   that I grew up in Indiana.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   So before basketball, I was playing football as well,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.520]   playing quarterback, so you were a big part of my childhood.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   So it's an honor to have you on here, bro.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.960]   - I appreciate it, honored to be here.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.400]   - Man, a lot of people know you from being on the court.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.680]   We actually, I saw you at our arena playing with your kids,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.920]   you know what I mean, just shooting around with 'em.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.460]   So kinda update us where you are now.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.720]   What are you doing now off the field
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.800]   and everything like that?
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.140]   - Yeah, kind of the second chapter for me,
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.800]   I've tried to kinda pick, say, maybe kinda one thing
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.640]   to kinda focus on that year,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   and then maybe you keep doing it if you like it,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.040]   or maybe you change it up.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.300]   I haven't really had like this five or 10 year plan.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300]   You know, when you're playing like football, basketball,
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.200]   you pretty much know where you're gonna be
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   every day, all year, right?
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.920]   And that's the biggest change about this next chapter,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.640]   but I didn't wanna sign up for something
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   to be a broadcaster, to be a coach,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.960]   where I knew that's what I was doing
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.800]   for the next five, 10 years.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.240]   I've just kinda taken it one year at a time.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.320]   Don't really have a one word job description.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.700]   I'm the assistant offensive coordinator
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.520]   on my son's sixth grade football team.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.600]   It's a very important role.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120]   I'm not qualified to be the head coach,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.120]   so I'm just the assistant coach.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   Yeah, I do some stuff in the TV space.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   Eli and I obviously do this Monday night show.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.720]   I do it from Denver, he does it from New Jersey.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.120]   I feel like my kids, Ashley and the kids,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.400]   that's my number one priority,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.080]   but I like staying busy.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.480]   I like staying stimulated.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.640]   I like my kids seeing me busy, seeing me working, right?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.840]   That's important to me.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.160]   And still get to a lot of sporting events,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   get to the Nuggets games, get to the Broncos games.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.200]   So I'm busy, but I'm kinda busy on my own schedule,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.040]   which is a good thing.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.860]   - Right.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.840]   So a lot of athletes that I know of,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.320]   once they retire, they kinda have sometimes
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040]   like a identity crisis or a midlife crisis.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.880]   Did you at all deal with that,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   or how did you work your way through that time
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   going from stardom to kinda being away from the spotlight?
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   Was it hard for you at all?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.680]   - There's no doubt it's an adjustment, right?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.240]   Just going back to that earlier point.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.880]   Football, you have a schedule all season, all off season.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.320]   All of a sudden, that stops.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.720]   The thing, I was fortunate.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.160]   I got to play football for a long time,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.400]   and I really got to kinda end it on my terms,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.320]   which doesn't often happen, right?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.440]   A lot of times in sports, you don't get to retire.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.120]   You're kinda retired, right?
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   Nobody calls you anymore and says,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.200]   "We want you to come play for the Broncos
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.040]   "or the Nuggets."
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.400]   So I was grateful for the time that I got to play.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   And so, look, you're always gonna miss your teammates.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.920]   And around playoff time, Super Bowl time,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   you always miss it a little bit.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   Then I heard Derrick Jeter say one time
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.920]   after he retired, great shortstop for the Yankees,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.160]   he said, "If I could parachute
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.720]   "into the World Series every year, sure.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.100]   "I'd probably like to do that."
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.940]   - With the grind.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.200]   - He didn't miss spring training.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.280]   He didn't miss all that.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   And so I don't miss it either
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   because I got to do it for a long time.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   But staying in touch with my teammates on a text thread,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.520]   you suddenly miss seeing 'em every day.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.360]   You miss the locker room, you miss the plane rides.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   So I was just grateful for the time that I had.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.120]   So I guess in the second chapter,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   I didn't really look for that.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   I didn't miss being on the field
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.380]   because I was grateful for the time that I got to do it.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.380]   Our kids had just maybe turned five years old at the time,
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.800]   so they're getting into school.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.880]   That was a nice kinda timing to kinda be able
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   to sorta dive into their lives and everything.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.600]   And so it's been a pretty good transition,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.240]   and I still go to a ton of games.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.480]   I went to four University of Tennessee games last year.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   All the Broncos, home games.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.960]   Went to a couple Colts games.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.040]   So I still find myself kinda hanging around football.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.680]   - How long do you think you could've played?
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.480]   Like if it was, like you said,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.440]   if you could parachute into the finals right now, you would.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.800]   But how many more seasons do you think you could've played?
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   - I don't know.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.960]   I mean, I think everybody could probably always
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.580]   have played one more.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.580]   How well are you gonna play is probably a fair question.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.400]   So I never really looked at it that way.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.080]   Like I said, I got to play 14 years in Indianapolis,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.120]   four great years here in Denver.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.160]   Still live here.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   - Wait, it was that many years in Indy?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.040]   - 14 in Indy, yeah.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880]   Does that make any sense?
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   - I did not realize that.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   - So how old were you when I was playing for the Colts?
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.560]   - So yeah, like I said, I was born in Indy,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.320]   and a lot of people think that I was born in Missouri,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   but I really was born in Indy,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   and I was there 'til fifth grade.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.000]   - What years?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.820]   What years were you?
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.040]   - What do you think?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.880]   How many, what do you think that was?
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.960]   - I think it was 2010.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   - 2010. - Okay.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.480]   - Okay, so like my whole childhood was Indy.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.400]   I remember they built the Lucas Oil Stadium.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.240]   - There you go.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.060]   - I remember all that.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.900]   - There you go, I like it.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.480]   - I remember Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.740]   And honestly, like, I was a big football fan growing up.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.800]   You know, I paid attention to all y'all's games.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   When we moved to Missouri,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.040]   'cause we were in Columbia, Missouri,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.640]   so the Rams were over here,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.080]   then you got the Chiefs over here.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.780]   I really didn't pick up on any teams,
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.160]   so kinda like my love for football kinda like went away.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.000]   - It stayed with you.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.840]   Oh, it did, okay.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.660]   - It went away.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.080]   Like I paid attention to the Colts a little bit,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.520]   but like, I wasn't in the city, so it didn't.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.840]   - Yeah, when there's not a team in your town.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.800]   - Yeah, so it was hard, but.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   - Yeah, so no, it was, like I said,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.520]   I was grateful for the time that I got to play
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.080]   two different places, and you know,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.480]   I just felt like after we just won the Super Bowl,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.940]   it just felt like it was the right time to stop playing.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.440]   I was, I dealt with some injuries,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.240]   you know, possibly might have had to go
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.680]   find another team to play for.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.760]   The Broncos had some quarterback, you know,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.280]   personnel decisions to make,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.480]   and didn't really wanna go through
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.440]   that process again necessarily,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   so just felt like the right time,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.160]   and I've been at peace with it ever since.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.280]   - I did not realize it was 18 years that you played.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   How do you feel like your purpose kinda shifted?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   Like, I feel like even me now in the NBA
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.760]   kinda like so much of your focus goes to foot,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.320]   to your sport, for you football, for me basketball.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.640]   How do you feel like your purpose
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.240]   and just life in general changed
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.000]   from when you were playing to now, what you're doing now?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   - Yeah, I mean obviously, you know,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.360]   being a good dad is kinda my number one, you know,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   priority, you know, being a part of our kids' lives
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.800]   is important for Ashley and I.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.520]   My parents, you know, my dad specifically,
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.040]   after he retired from football,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.880]   he was present in our lives, right?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.380]   He was at our little league basketball games
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.660]   and baseball games, and never coached us per se,
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.800]   but he'd come and throw passes with us on the weekends,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   and so that was important to me,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   so that's kinda been my number one priority.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.760]   I mean, I'll be at a baseball game this weekend,
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.640]   I'll be at a volleyball game this weekend, right?
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.800]   And so I didn't wanna sign up for anything
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.880]   that was gonna take me away from that.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.960]   For the majority, you know, of my football time,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.480]   our kids either weren't born or were quite young,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.280]   so I didn't have that potential decision to make,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.160]   hey, am I gonna go to their, you know, youth football game,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720]   or am I gonna go study some film?
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.640]   And so it was nice not to have to choose, right?
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.760]   I wanted to be, I wanna be a great dad,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.520]   I wanna be a great football player at the same time,
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.740]   and so we sort of waited, you know, for that reason.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.400]   Look, I enjoy being an ambassador for the game,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   I enjoy being a resource to young quarterbacks.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   I saw just this past weekend Josh Allen and Justin Herbert,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.960]   and I have their phone numbers, and you know,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.940]   I mean, anytime they wanna reach out to me with a question,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.800]   you know, those guys kinda have it figured out,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.000]   they don't need a lot of my help,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.160]   but I like being able to pay it forward,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.320]   because a lot of people helped me when I was a young player.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.680]   I mean, of course my dad had played,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.000]   but guys like Troy Aikman, Dan Marino,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.960]   they gave me some tips and pointers
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.000]   when I was a young player,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.120]   so I feel like that's a kind of a cool hat to wear,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.200]   a little bit of a purpose there,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.360]   that you feel like you're still a part of the game,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.960]   not on the field, but you're still helping to grow the game
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.040]   and helping young football players.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   - 100%, how did you, so how did you meet your wife?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   You said her name's Ashley?
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.840]   - Yeah, we met in college, yeah.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.000]   - How'd you know she was the one?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   - So, you know, we met at, she didn't go to Tennessee,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.040]   she went to the University of Virginia,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.640]   and we met there when I was a freshman
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.560]   and kind of agreed to have kind of a date later in the year,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.280]   and just kind of went from there,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.040]   you know, dated all through college.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.320]   - Honestly, I say that all the time,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.900]   like it's ideal to meet the girl earlier on,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.320]   like you met her in college, you said,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.920]   but before everything, that's the problem nowadays,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.520]   is like, you make it, and then it's hard to figure out
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.960]   and navigate that situation.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   - I get that, yeah.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.880]   No, there's no doubt, everything's changed a lot,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.800]   you know, with, look, I grew up college football
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.560]   the majority of my first years in the NFL
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.360]   before social media, you know,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.040]   so you didn't have all the different opinions, right,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.320]   and comments, and right, and look,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.000]   it can affect players, right, they read comments,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.960]   and it affects, you know, kind of how they feel sometimes
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.840]   about their playing time or the coaches or whatnot,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.440]   so it was a nice way to play, you know,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.200]   for the majority of my career, kind of without that,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.260]   because it certainly can be a challenge
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.640]   if you don't handle it well.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.480]   - How do you think, yeah, like,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.920]   do you feel like if social media was a big thing back then,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.280]   that would have affected you at all on the field,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.060]   like the different comments, pressures,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.640]   or did you somehow kind of like--
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.280]   - Yeah, no, I mean, look, you know,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.040]   playing in Indianapolis, you know, you grew up there,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.480]   look, it's not the biggest market,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.000]   but the media is into it, right, the fans are into it,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.080]   but then, like, my brother Eli goes to play in New York,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.640]   and that's like, you know, times 25,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.960]   and so Eli was the one that kind of helped me with that,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.760]   and he kind of, he said, look, Peyton,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.520]   like, I used to read the paper after we won, right,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.260]   you know, everybody likes to read, you know--
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.880]   - 100%, look up their name on Twitter--
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.680]   - They're saying good things about you, right,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   but then when, if it didn't go well, you know,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.900]   I wouldn't read it, and Eli's like,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.480]   what I've learned here in New York is like,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.200]   like, you don't read it at all, you know,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   you don't read the good, you don't read the bad,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   and you just stay even keeled, right,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   and it just keeps you from going on this roller coaster,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.560]   right, of, you know, emotional, you know,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.240]   mood swings and frustrations or whatnot, right?
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.720]   Ultimately, as a player, I think the ultimate question is,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.120]   are you doing the job that you're supposed to do
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.800]   for your coach, right?
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.320]   I mean, really, anybody else's opinion outside of that
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.000]   really shouldn't factor in to how you're feeling.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.840]   I always felt like I was my own biggest critic, right?
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.640]   If a reporter, you know, criticized me for my play,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.000]   it probably wasn't gonna be as rough
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.080]   as I was already on myself,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.520]   so I didn't feel like that affected me too much,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.400]   but I think that there's something about
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.640]   trying to stay even keeled,
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.480]   kind of block out the outside noise,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.400]   especially as you get into big games and playoff games,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.640]   hey, let me just focus in on what I need to do,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.520]   and especially what I need to do for my team.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.480]   - 100%.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.720]   How was it growing up with your brothers, Eli,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.800]   and then you had an older brother, too.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.040]   - Yeah, Cooper, yeah.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   - Yeah, how was it growing up with them,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.160]   and how good would your older brother have been
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   if he didn't have the injuries he had?
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.400]   - Cooper was an outstanding athlete with the Ole Miss.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.920]   As a wide receiver on scholarship,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.040]   we played together in high school one year.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.120]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.760]   You grew up playing in the backyard with your brother,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.960]   drawing plays in the dirt.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.720]   Now you get to play on a real football field with him,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   so I had a neck injury there when he was in two-a-days
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.120]   at Ole Miss, his freshman year.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   He had to give up his career.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.400]   It was tough.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.840]   He handled it extremely well.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.760]   It had a big impact on me.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.280]   Like when I went through my injuries,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   just Cooper handled it with grace.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.640]   He had a good attitude about it.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.560]   - He's a doctor now, right?
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.880]   - So, no, I am not gonna tell him
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.600]   that you actually thought he was a doctor,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.360]   'cause he probably thinks he could do that as well.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.320]   No, Cooper's doing very good.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.160]   He's got a great family,
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.360]   been very successful in business,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.920]   and he just handled it, right?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.600]   So, it was a fun way to grow up, having two brothers.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.640]   You got an older brother to kinda look up to
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.960]   and kinda help me out,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.560]   and then Eli was five years younger than me,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.800]   so it was a fun way to grow up.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.000]   - Did you guys have any,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.120]   I have four brothers, four younger brothers.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.560]   Did you guys have any fights growing up?
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.760]   - Yeah, I mean, Eli was probably too young
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.040]   to kinda be able to play one-on-one basketball
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   growing up as kids.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.080]   Cooper and I certainly went at it a little more,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.360]   but we always try to get along kind of in the end
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.680]   and kinda have each other's backs,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.760]   which I think's a good thing to do with your siblings.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.200]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.520]   Man, so one thing that I've always admired about you
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.920]   is just your leadership qualities.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.000]   You can see it on the floor.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.840]   You hear about it.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   You know, something's always,
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.280]   when you talk about Peyton Manning,
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.080]   it's his leadership.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.320]   What are the leadership qualities
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.920]   you feel like you kinda possessed,
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.120]   and how did you kinda get to the point
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.680]   where you could execute those?
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.880]   - Yeah, I mean, I think being a leader,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.720]   look, just because you're the point guard
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.560]   or the quarterback doesn't automatically
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.000]   make you the leader, right?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.160]   I think you gotta earn kinda being a leader.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.960]   And so I kinda learned the hard way in college.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.360]   First time I got in the huddle,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.280]   I kinda went in with this rah-rah speech
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.960]   and a bunch of seniors are just like,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.760]   "Hey, don't talk.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.060]   "Just call the play.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.920]   "It's all we're gonna do."
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.600]   And so you kinda learn that.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.280]   It's a pretty good lesson that you wanna earn,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.160]   I think, the respect of the people
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.240]   that you're trying to lead, right,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.280]   before you start barking orders
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   and telling them what to do.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.880]   I think the other thing I do,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.680]   at least I thought I tried to do a good job of,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   is I was tough on myself, you know?
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.280]   And I was vocal about that, right?
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   If I missed a throw, I would kinda say it out loud.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.120]   Like, "Hey, that's a bad throw.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.840]   "That's a horrible decision.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.960]   "You know, no excuse."
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.840]   And so I think when my teammates heard
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.640]   that I was tough on myself,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.260]   that if I was told then,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.320]   "Hey, look, this route needs to be 16 yards, right?
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.480]   "You're going 14.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.920]   "It needs to be..."
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.360]   That it was all fair, right?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.480]   I wasn't picking on anybody 'cause I was hard on myself,
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   and I just believed in getting the little things right,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   that the little details mattered in a football game,
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.200]   that 14 yards was different than 16 yards.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.840]   It might be the difference in the incompletion
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   or an interception.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.120]   So I felt like I put the work in.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.720]   You know, I wasn't gonna ask anybody to do anything
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.120]   that I wasn't already doing myself.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.960]   And so, and you know, I felt like I admitted
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.040]   when I, you know, made a mistake through an interception.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.600]   I thought, you know, I tried to be accountable.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.960]   So I think those are some of the best things
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   a leader can do, is letting everybody know,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.640]   "Hey, I'm riding this thing with you."
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.480]   - Right, accountability.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.760]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   - There's a picture of you with your foot,
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.720]   like you've been in a hot tub or cold tub.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.960]   You got your helmet on, you're watching something.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.240]   Talk about that because, I mean,
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.380]   obviously you're a detailed person.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.480]   I think you were injured at that time.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.320]   - Right, yeah.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.200]   - And I wanna know the backstory on that picture.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.880]   - Yeah, I guess it's the all-time multi-tasker.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.760]   You know, when you're hurt, it's tough
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.280]   'cause a lot of times the best time to rehab
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.320]   is like during practice, right?
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.000]   You know, you have kind of one-on-one time
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.280]   in the athletic training room.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.320]   And so the team was out practicing
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.600]   and, you know, the quarterbacks have an earpiece
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.060]   in their helmets where the coach calls the play
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.800]   into the helmet.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.160]   And so I wanted to be at practice,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.200]   but I had to do some, yeah, I had kind of foot problems.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.080]   I was doing cold and ice tub on my foot.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.400]   So I had my helmet on where I could still hear
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.360]   the plays being called.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.640]   I could kind of visualize the play.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.720]   And I had my iPad where I was, you know,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.960]   studying some film, you know, of the team.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.720]   So, yeah, multi-tasking and camera caught me.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   - When I think of, like, intentionality and, like, focus
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.360]   and, like, in the basketball space, you think of Kobe.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.640]   You know, you think of just his intentional detail.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.480]   - Right.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.060]   - And then in football, like, I think of you.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.000]   Was that, besides that level of intentionality,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.160]   what else do you think separated you kind of
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.240]   from the rest of, you know, quarterbacks,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   but just players in general?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.160]   Like, what was the main things that set you apart?
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.600]   - Yeah, you know, it's kind of always been,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.280]   like, that's kind of hard for me to answer.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.800]   You know, I always felt like sometimes when a teammate
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.480]   that played with you also went and played for other teams,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.960]   you know, they could give a comparison, right?
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   So I never knew if I was doing anything different,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.500]   you know, than anybody else.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.420]   Look, I took, I had great respect and appreciation
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.780]   for the cerebral part of the game.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.380]   You know, I wasn't gonna outrun anybody
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.500]   or throw it, you know, 80 yards down the field.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.540]   So I felt like I had to out-prepare 'em.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.980]   And I felt like the film study,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.860]   the communication with my receivers,
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.220]   being a, just having the master knowledge of the playbook,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.860]   that really helped me, right?
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.620]   So when I got out there on Sundays or Saturdays in college
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.340]   or Friday nights in high school,
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.020]   I felt like I'd kind of out-prepared the opponent,
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.140]   whether I had or I hadn't, I kind of told myself that,
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.260]   hey, nobody has worked harder for me
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.980]   to get ready for this game.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.940]   That just gave me a little more confidence
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.300]   out there on Sundays.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.200]   And look, the game of football moves so fast.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.480]   So I don't care how fast you are, how strong your arm is,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.880]   if you don't understand everything about what you're doing
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.340]   as an offense and also understand
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.680]   what the defense is doing, it moves even faster.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.960]   So that's kind of where I felt like I could get an edge
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.060]   on the competition.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.080]   Yeah, just the mental side of it.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.760]   I felt like I played, you mentioned those guys,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.160]   Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.400]   like I played with a lot of the same guys
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.720]   for a number of years, right?
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.680]   So we had good continuity.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.560]   We weren't starting over.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.840]   I played in the same offensive system,
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.880]   pretty much the same every single year.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.400]   Denver had changed here a little bit,
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.240]   but Tom Brady played in the same system
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.440]   in New England all those years.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.100]   I mean, when you're having to change plays
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.440]   for a quarterback every single year, that's hard.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.280]   That's tough.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.800]   And so I was fortunate, I had great support system,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.240]   great coaches to help me, and players.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.440]   We played together for a while.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.960]   So I think all those things kind of helped.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.640]   - So like routine-wise, like specifically,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.480]   like obviously you've got your game day routine.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.360]   We have our game day routines.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.520]   I feel like the off days sometimes are the days
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.840]   where you can like gain that extra ground.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.260]   What would that specifically look like?
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.360]   Like how much film and how much of that like mental work,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.160]   I don't know if it was meditation, film work,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.320]   or whatever it was, where you actually like doing?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.280]   - Yeah, you know, it's been seven years now,
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.120]   so you're making me go back to,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.600]   I probably don't have the exact itinerary
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.720]   of what I used to do on Tuesdays,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.560]   but there's no doubt that I was trying to use Tuesdays,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.280]   which is the universal off day in the NFL,
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.640]   to try to get ahead, right?
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.840]   And so I was a big believer in watching
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.280]   kind of the game film opponents,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.720]   like their past four games.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.080]   I was gonna watch those four games
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.920]   and get a good feel for kind of who that team was
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.600]   and what their identity was on defense.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   And then with the coaches, you know,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.400]   you watch, you know, kind of different film.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.200]   I watched a lot of film myself, right?
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.480]   I mean, I watched practice hard, watched the game hard,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.680]   watched, we filmed all the individual drills, right?
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.040]   I think sometimes you get caught up into,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   hey, let's try to figure out these great plays to run,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.640]   that we're getting ready to play this team,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.200]   and all of a sudden, your mechanics are off,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.120]   you know, you're not finishing your throw,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.000]   you're not finishing your shot,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.760]   and so it doesn't matter if the play is great
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.840]   if you're not doing your deal.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.960]   So I'm studying a lot of that.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.520]   I think, and you get into that routine.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.400]   I mean, I think your question is great.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.280]   I think it's important to have a routine, right?
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.640]   I mean, to kind of write down what that routine is,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.480]   and not just sort of wing it every single day.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.520]   - Honestly, like for the majority of my life,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.160]   that's kind of how I've lived,
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.520]   like kind of just like free flow throughout the day,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.600]   and then I've recently understood the importance
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.040]   of just intentionality.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   - Right.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   - Like you said, writing down the routine,
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.200]   you know, waking up at this time,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.760]   what are you doing at this time?
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.240]   And you still are a very intentional person.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.800]   Like, I'll hit you, I'll text you, like, when can we talk?
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.360]   You'll be like, next Sunday at 11 a.m.,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.560]   like I'll be like--
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.800]   - 11.03 to be specific, yeah.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   - Do you still live with like that same intentionality,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.640]   and why is that?
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.280]   - Yeah, that drives my family crazy, just so you know.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   So I probably could do a little better on that,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.840]   of being a little more free flowing in this second chapter.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.680]   But I think it's just, you know, like playing football
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   those years, I mean, that's how you just kind of get wired,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.400]   that you, like an eight o'clock meeting means
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.080]   it's gonna be an eight o'clock meeting, right?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.480]   I mean, football, you do not want to walk into a meeting
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.680]   at 8.02, 'cause that's late and everybody's in there.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.840]   So you kind of learn that, so you kind of get on time
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.880]   and you get a schedule.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.080]   So I feel like it serves you well for the most part.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.480]   Like I said, it can probably, you know, annoy your family
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.840]   and annoy your friends on a golf trip when, you know.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.760]   I said specifically, we're gonna have breakfast at 7.07,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.840]   right, that's probably a little much.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.340]   But, you know, look, I think just trying to be,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.080]   you know, goes back to that routine, I think it helps
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.840]   when you kind of have a plan.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   - I agree.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.680]   I'm super curious about your second Super Bowl with Denver.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.080]   That was after your injuries, correct?
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.560]   - Correct.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.040]   - And obviously I've had my own injuries,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.480]   so like I look at that and I'm like,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.120]   he made it all the way back to Super Bowl status
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.880]   post injuries.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.680]   Was there like a lot of limitations in your arm
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.120]   and how did you kind of like work through that?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.400]   You said Eli Cooper, you said helped you.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.240]   - Yeah.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.400]   Well, just the fact that, I think when you go through
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   an injury or through a tough time,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.520]   I think having a good attitude is important.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.240]   That's easier said than done, right?
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.440]   I mean, you're not gonna be super happy
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.880]   that you're hurt and you're not playing,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.160]   but there's a reason it happened.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.040]   And it's kind of a test, you know.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.480]   Are you gonna handle that test?
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   Are you gonna pass that test?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.720]   So I tried to, you know, have an upbeat attitude.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.240]   I think that probably helped in kind of getting over
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.000]   those injuries and kind of healing a little bit.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.320]   You know, I had a lot of people help me,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.720]   teammates supporting me, that made a difference.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.840]   I think you just learn that you can't, you know,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.680]   maybe do certain things that you used to do,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.600]   but you can adjust and still figure out how to do it,
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.040]   I think is kind of the key.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.960]   So, you know, I was fortunate to come here and play
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.400]   and like I said, have four years and still continue
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.160]   to deal with some other injuries, you know,
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.040]   when I got here and had great teammates and coaches,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.760]   but, you know, I think being, learning to adapt to,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.320]   you know, post injuries is important.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   - 100%.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   You say you feel like there was a reason for it,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.120]   and I feel like a lot of people,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.760]   when things happen to them, they can't figure it out.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.080]   They don't even just, they don't have that faith
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.000]   that there was a reason.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.760]   Do you have like a faith, just like in that aspect?
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.600]   Do you, you know?
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.640]   - Sure, no, certainly not.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.320]   I think it's a great test of your faith,
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.880]   and I felt like when I went through my injuries,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.680]   look, I was frustrated, I was disappointed,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.240]   but I felt like it was a good Lord's plan
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.440]   that, hey, you know, you're next gonna have some problems
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.720]   and you're not gonna play this year.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.040]   And so it's a test, it's a test of your faith, you know,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.720]   and to see if you can kind of trust that it's His plan
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.120]   and kind of a little bit out of your hands.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.480]   So I definitely think that's a part of it.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.040]   And look, you know, overcoming adversity,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.680]   overcoming tough times, if you play sports long enough,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.360]   you know, that's gonna happen
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.240]   and you better learn to do it.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.600]   And I think having people around you
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.480]   to help you overcome it, you know, is also important.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.880]   But I think, you know, praying about it
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.280]   and kind of trusting in the man upstairs' plan
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.200]   is probably the best way to overcome it.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.560]   - Have you always had that faith in God?
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.360]   Like, what are you, Christian?
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.520]   Christian, you've always had that?
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.880]   - Yeah, yeah, sure, so.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.000]   - Man, my last question for you is,
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   like I said, like you're an idol of mine,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   Kobe, some of these great, Michael Jordan.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.920]   What is your way of defining greatness?
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   How would you define it?
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.440]   'Cause everyone doesn't have the physical capabilities
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.480]   to be the best.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.320]   - Yeah.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.160]   - How would you define it?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.600]   - I don't know, I, you know,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.120]   probably never really thought about that as much.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.880]   And, you know, I think you just,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.800]   I always tried to be, you know, football,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.640]   I always liked team sports, right?
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.040]   I played basketball, I played golf with my buddies,
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.960]   but never, you know, competed in golf.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.840]   But, you know, I always thought,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.960]   like you kind of had an obligation,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.360]   if you signed up for the team,
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.200]   to do everything you could to help the team
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.080]   and be your best for the team, right?
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.680]   And I think that's what always just kind of drove me,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.160]   that I knew people were counting on me, right?
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.360]   I mean, football, that's your teammates, that's your coaches.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.280]   Look, that's the support staff, you know,
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.360]   the equipment managers, the video directors.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.760]   You know, when, if you don't play well
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.600]   and they fire the coach, a lot of times they fire,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.400]   you know, a lot of people along with that, right?
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.000]   So, yeah, I'm not saying people's jobs were counting on me,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.640]   but I think, you know, people were counting on me.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.240]   Fans, right, they're invested into the team, you know,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.320]   and the owner who drafted you.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.440]   I mean, you want to, I mean, you want to,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.080]   the draft's coming up in the NFL.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.280]   And I remember when the coach drafted me,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.040]   I wanted to give our owner, you know,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.200]   I want to make him proud of his decision to draft me, right?
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.240]   - Right.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.400]   - When they draft you, it's not really a reward.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.680]   It's kind of a, hey, we're going to bring you to the team.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.120]   We expect you to do some things for us, right?
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.040]   And I think that's a good mentality.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.600]   And so, I guess that's what I thought about.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   So, I never used the word greatness in describing myself
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.040]   or was necessarily thinking about that.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.880]   I was just thinking about, I wanted to do my part, right,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.080]   you know, for the team.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.800]   And I think that's why I worked really hard
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.880]   to try to do that and whatever came along with that,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.280]   you know, it wasn't all perfect.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.960]   We had certainly disappointing losses
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.360]   and, you know, heartbreaking moments,
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.520]   but I think you kind of learn how to handle that
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.440]   and maybe you come out of it stronger on the other side.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.760]   - Well, man, I appreciate you, bro.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   Like I said, it means a lot that you would even make the time
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.080]   to come over here and do this with me.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.000]   Yeah, I appreciate you getting on the podcast, my man.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.840]   - Hey, you bet.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.520]   Good luck, good luck in the playoffs.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.600]   - Appreciate you, appreciate you.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.440]   That's a wrap.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.840]   Go watch three plays
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.960]   and get Peyton Manning's perspective on these plays.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.280]   - If I remember, yeah, that's a-
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.680]   - It's a minute, definitely a minute ago.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   All right, let's go.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.760]   - I do remember that play.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.280]   That was the first play of the game.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.880]   It was down in New Orleans.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.720]   We lost that game.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.680]   These guys got Marcus Pollard was a good teammate of mine,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.520]   good buddy of mine.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.640]   But yeah, you don't throw many touchdowns
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.560]   on the first play of the game.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.680]   Usually you call it a play to try to get a completion,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.200]   right, and just kind of had the perfect play
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.320]   at the perfect time called and he took it for 80 yards, so.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.680]   - 80 yards, first play of the game.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.520]   This was against Baltimore.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.480]   This is an interesting scenario.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.920]   Baltimore won the Super Bowl the year before
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.960]   and they didn't get to open up at home
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.760]   because of like a scheduling conflict
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.560]   with their baseball team in town.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.480]   So they had to come.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.720]   - Yeah, it was smacking them.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.440]   - They had to open their,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.160]   defend their title here in Denver.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.880]   And so, which probably wasn't fair.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.560]   But yeah, that was just a go-route to Demarius Thomas
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.320]   who, God rest his soul, we lost last year.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.100]   He was my good buddy.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.240]   And it wasn't, that's more on him than me.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.760]   My guess is throwing it up to him, letting him,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.600]   letting him do his thing.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.440]   - Was he tall?
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.040]   - Yeah, he's a big guy, for sure.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   - We're all the way at 49.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.960]   We need to go to the top.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.600]   - Yeah, these are, these are outdated.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.440]   Now, this was at the time to break
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   the all-time touchdown record.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.000]   I think Breeze and Brady have broken them,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.040]   broken that record several times since then, so.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.880]   - Oh, really?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.720]   - But at the time, Brett Favre had
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.800]   the all-time touchdown record.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.960]   And so that pass was to break it.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.920]   But what I liked about it is that we won the game.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.360]   You know, we weren't doing anything
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.840]   just to try to build a record, right?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.680]   - Did that get tipped?
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.600]   - Kind of a close game.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.440]   No, I threw a lot of wobbly passes, Mike.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   - Oh, did you?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.520]   - It just looked like they got tipped.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.800]   But I appreciate you asking that.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   No, so that was cool.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.720]   Yeah, it was still in the second quarter.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.480]   So we broke the record and kind of got that over with
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.080]   and went on to win the game.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.240]   But I love quarterbacks.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.920]   Yeah, they played keep-away with me
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.520]   from the football afterwards, so.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.680]   This is in the Super Bowl.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.720]   This was against the Bears.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.000]   And Bears actually kind of screwed up the coverage.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.160]   He was pretty open.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.520]   It was a matter of kind of getting to him, so.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.920]   Down in the rain, down in Miami.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.320]   So that's always a fun one to watch.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.720]   It was, you know, first championship for the Colts.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.780]   So it was fun to be a part of that.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.120]   First championship for Indianapolis.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.200]   So it was fun to be a part of that.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   - Dope, man.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.600]   Appreciate you.
