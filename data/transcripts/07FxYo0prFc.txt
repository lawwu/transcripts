[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.160]   - All right, welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.320]   I'm here with Peyton Manning.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.060]   Man, it's an honor to have you on here, bro.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.060]   I think I told you this when we met at the arena,
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.200]   that I grew up in Indiana.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   So before basketball, I was playing football as well,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.040]   playing quarterback.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.560]   So, you know, you were a big part of my childhood.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.880]   So it's an honor to have you on here, bro.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.940]   - I appreciate it, honored to be here.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.560]   - Man, a lot of people know you from, you know,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.400]   being on the court.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.640]   We actually, I saw you at our arena playing with your kids,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.600]   you know what I mean?
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.880]   Just shooting around with them.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.420]   So kind of update us where you are now.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.680]   What are you doing now off the field
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.760]   and everything like that?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.080]   - You know, kind of the second chapter for me,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.200]   I've tried to kind of pick,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.560]   say maybe kind of one thing to kind of focus on that year.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.480]   And then maybe you keep doing it if you like it,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.000]   or maybe you change it up.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.240]   I haven't really had like this five or 10 year plan.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240]   You know, when you're playing like football, basketball,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.160]   you pretty much know where you're gonna be
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.680]   every day, all year, right?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.880]   And that's the biggest change about this next chapter.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.580]   But I didn't want to sign up for something
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640]   to be a broadcaster, to be a coach,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.920]   where I knew that's what I was doing
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   for the next five, 10 years.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.200]   I've just kind of taken it one year at a time.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.280]   Don't really have a one word job description.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.660]   I'm the assistant offensive coordinator
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.480]   on my son's sixth grade football team.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.600]   That's a very important role.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120]   I'm not qualified to be the head coach,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.140]   so I'm just the assistant coach.
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960]   Yeah, I do some stuff in the TV space.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   Eli and I obviously do this Monday night show.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.740]   I do it from Denver, he does it from New Jersey.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.120]   I feel like my kids, Ashley and the kids,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.400]   that's my number one priority.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.080]   But I like staying busy.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.480]   I like staying stimulated.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.640]   I like my kids seeing me busy, seeing me working, right?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.840]   That's important to me.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.160]   And still get to a lot of sporting events,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.180]   get to the Nuggets games, get to the Broncos games.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.240]   So I'm busy, but I'm kind of busy on my own schedule,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.080]   which is a good thing.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.900]   - Right.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.860]   So a lot of athletes that I know of,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.340]   once they retire, they kind of have sometimes
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.080]   like a identity crisis or a midlife crisis.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   Did you at all deal with that,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   or how did you work your way through that time
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.680]   going from stardom to kind of being away from the spotlight?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.040]   Was it hard for you at all?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.700]   - There's no doubt it's an adjustment, right?
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.600]   Just going back to that earlier point.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.140]   Football, you have a schedule all season,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.300]   all off season, all of a sudden that stops.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.700]   The thing, I was fortunate,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.180]   I got to play football for a long time,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.380]   and I really got to kind of end it on my terms,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.300]   which doesn't often happen, right?
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.420]   A lot of times in sports, you don't get to retire,
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.160]   you're kind of retired, right?
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.180]   Nobody calls you anymore and says,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.900]   we want you to come play for the Broncos or the Nuggets.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.440]   So I was grateful for the time that I got to play.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.160]   And so, look, you're always going to miss your teammates.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.920]   And around playoff time, Super Bowl time,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   you always miss it a little bit.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   Then I heard Derrick Jeter say one time
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.920]   after he retired, great shortstop for the Yankees,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.240]   he said, if I could parachute
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.800]   into the World Series every year, sure.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.080]   I'd probably like to do that.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.920]   - But it's the grind.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280]   - He didn't miss spring training, he didn't miss all that.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   And so I don't miss it either
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   because I got to do it for a long time,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   but stay in touch with my teammates on a text thread.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.520]   You certainly miss seeing them every day.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.360]   You miss the locker room, you miss the plane rides.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   So I was just grateful for the time that I had.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.120]   So I guess in the second chapter,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   I didn't really look for that.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   I didn't miss being on the field
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.380]   because I was grateful for the time that I got to do it.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.380]   Our kids had just maybe turned five years old at the time,
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.800]   so they're getting into school.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.940]   That was a nice kind of timing
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.040]   to kind of be able to sort of dive into their lives
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.360]   and everything.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.600]   And so it's been a pretty good transition
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.240]   and I still go to a ton of games.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.480]   I went to four University of Tennessee games last year,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   all the Broncos home games,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.960]   went to a couple of Colts games.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.040]   So I still find myself kind of hanging around football.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.680]   - How long do you think you could have played?
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.480]   Like if it was, like you said,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.440]   if you could parachute into the finals right now, you would,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.760]   but how many more seasons do you think you could have played?
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.600]   - I don't know.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.960]   I think everybody could probably always
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.580]   have played one more.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.580]   How well are you going to play is probably a fair question.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.420]   So I never really looked at it that way.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.080]   Like I said, I got to play 14 years in Indianapolis,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.160]   four great years here in Denver, still live here.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   - Wait, it was that many years in Indy?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.000]   - 14 in Indy, yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.880]   - I did not realize that.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   - So how old were you when I was playing for the Colts?
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.560]   - So yeah, like I said, I was born in Indy
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.320]   and a lot of people think that I was born in Missouri,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.380]   but I really was born in Indy
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.160]   and I was there till fifth grade.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.740]   - What years were you?
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.040]   - What do you think?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   How many, what do you think that was?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.960]   2010. - Okay.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.480]   - Okay, so like my whole childhood was Indy.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   I remember they built the Lucas Oil Stadium.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.320]   - There you go.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.140]   - I remember all that.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.980]   - There you go, I like it.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.480]   - I remember Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.760]   And honestly, like I was a big football fan growing up.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   You know, I paid attention to all y'all's games
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.500]   when we moved to Missouri,
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.040]   'cause we were in Columbia, Missouri.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.640]   So the Rams were over here,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.080]   then you got the Chiefs over here.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.800]   I really didn't pick up on any teams,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.200]   so kinda like my love for football kinda like went away.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.400]   - Oh, it did, okay.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.240]   - It went away.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.100]   Like I paid attention to the Colts a little bit,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.680]   but like I wasn't in the city, so it didn't--
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.840]   - Yeah, when there's not a team in your town.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   - Yeah, so it was hard, but--
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.760]   - Yeah, so no, it was, like I said,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.520]   I was grateful for the time that I got to play
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.600]   two different places.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.480]   And I just felt like after we just won the Super Bowl,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.920]   it just felt like it was the right time to stop playing.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.420]   I dealt with some injuries.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.660]   Possibly might've had to go find another team to play for.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.240]   The Broncos had some quarterback personnel decisions to make
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.480]   and didn't really wanna go through
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.440]   that process again necessarily.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.420]   So it just felt like the right time,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.160]   and I've been at peace with it ever since.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.280]   - I did not realize it was 18 years that you played.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   How do you feel like your purpose kinda shifted?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   Like, I feel like even me now in the NBA
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   kinda like so much of your focus goes to your sport.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.320]   For you, football, for me, basketball.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.640]   How do you feel like your purpose
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.240]   and just life in general changed
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.040]   from when you were playing to now, what you're doing now?
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.560]   - Yeah, I mean obviously, being a good dad
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.880]   is kinda my number one priority.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   Being a part of our kids' lives is important for Ashley.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.560]   And my parents, my dad specifically,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.080]   after he retired from football,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.920]   he was present in our lives, right?
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.420]   He was at our little league basketball games
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.680]   and baseball games and never coached us per se,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.840]   but he'd come and throw passes with us on the weekends.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.040]   And so that was important to me.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   So that's kinda been my number one priority.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.800]   I mean, I'll be at a baseball game this weekend,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.680]   I'll be at a volleyball game this weekend, right?
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   And so I didn't wanna sign up for anything
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.920]   that was gonna take me away from that.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.000]   For the majority of my football time,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.480]   our kids either weren't born or were quite young.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.280]   So I didn't have that potential decision to make,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.160]   hey, am I gonna go to their youth football game
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720]   or am I gonna go study some film?
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.640]   And so it was nice not to have to choose, right?
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.800]   I wanted to be a great dad,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.520]   I wanted to be a great football player at the same time.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.740]   And so we sort of waited for that reason.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.400]   - Look, I enjoy being an ambassador for the game.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.840]   I enjoy being a resource to young quarterbacks.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.520]   I saw just this past weekend,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.720]   Josh Allen and Justin Herbert,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.440]   and I have their phone numbers.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.080]   And I mean, anytime they wanna reach out to me
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.800]   with a question, those guys kinda have it figured out.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.000]   They don't need a lot of my help,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.160]   but I like being able to pay it forward
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.320]   because a lot of people helped me when I was a young player.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.680]   And of course my dad had played,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.000]   but guys like Troy Aikman, Dan Marino,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.920]   they gave me some tips and pointers
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   when I was a young player.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.080]   So I feel like that's a kind of a cool hat to wear,
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.200]   a little bit of a purpose there.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   Do you feel like you're still a part of the game,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.920]   not on the field, but you're still helping to grow the game
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.040]   and helping young football players?
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.200]   - 100%, so how did you meet your wife?
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.240]   You said her name's Ashley?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.800]   - Yeah, we met in college, yeah.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   - How'd you know she was the one?
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   - So, you know, we met at, she didn't go to Tennessee.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.040]   She went to the University of Virginia,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.640]   and we met there when I was a freshman
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.680]   and kind of agreed to have a kind of a date
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.280]   later in the year, and just kind of went from there.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.000]   You know, dated all through college.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.280]   - Honestly, I say that all the time.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.880]   Like it's ideal to meet the girl earlier on.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.400]   Like you met her in college, you said, before everything.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.240]   - Right, yeah.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.120]   - That's the problem nowadays is like you make it,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.920]   and then it's hard to figure out and navigate that.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   - I get that, yeah.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.840]   No, there's no doubt everything's changed a lot.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.800]   You know, look, I grew up college football
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.520]   the majority of my first years in the NFL
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.360]   before social media, you know,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.040]   so you didn't have all the different opinions, right,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.120]   and comments, and look, it can affect players, right?
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.640]   They read comments, and it affects, you know,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   kind of how they feel sometimes about their playing time
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.160]   or the coaches or whatnot, so it was a nice way to play,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.880]   you know, for the majority of my career,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.640]   kind of without that, because it certainly can be
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.160]   a challenge if you don't handle--
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.000]   - The social media?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.820]   - If you don't handle it well.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.200]   - How do you think, yeah, like, do you feel like
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.960]   if social media was a big thing back then,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.300]   that would have affected you at all on the field,
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.080]   like the different comments, pressures,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.680]   or did you somehow kind of like--
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.320]   - Yeah, no, I mean, look, you know,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.040]   playing in Indianapolis, you know, you grew up there,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.480]   look, it's not the biggest market,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   but the media is into it, right?
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.980]   The fans are into it, but then like my brother Eli
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.400]   goes to play in New York, and that's like, you know,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.120]   times 25, and so Eli was the one that kind of helped me
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.620]   with that, and he kind of, he said, look, Peyton,
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.520]   like I used to read the paper after we won, right?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.280]   You know, everybody likes to read, you know--
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.960]   - 100%, look up their name on Twitter--
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.680]   - They're saying good things about you, right?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   But then when, if it didn't go well, you know,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.880]   I wouldn't read it, and Eli's like,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.480]   what I've learned here in New York is like,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.200]   like you don't read it at all, you know,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   you don't read the good, you don't read the bad,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   and you just stay even keeled, right?
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   And it just keeps you from going on this roller coaster,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.600]   right, of, you know, emotional, you know,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.280]   mood swings and frustrations or whatnot, right?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.720]   Ultimately, as a player, I think the ultimate question is,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.160]   are you doing the job that you're supposed to do
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.840]   for your coach, right?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.360]   I mean, really, anybody else's opinion outside of that
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.040]   really shouldn't factor in to how you're feeling.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.840]   I always felt like I was my own biggest critic, right?
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   If a reporter, you know, criticized me for my play,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.040]   it probably wasn't gonna be as rough
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.120]   as I was already on myself.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.560]   So I didn't feel like that affected me too much,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.440]   but I think that there's something about
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   trying to stay even keeled,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.560]   kind of block out the outside noise,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.440]   especially as you get into big games and playoff games,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.680]   hey, let me just focus in on what I need to do,
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   and especially what I need to do for my team.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.520]   - 100%.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.760]   How was it growing up with your brothers, Eli,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   and then you had an older brother, too, who--
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.080]   - Yeah, Cooper, yeah.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.440]   - Yeah, how was it growing up with them,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.200]   and how good would your older brother have been
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.800]   if he didn't have the injuries he had?
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.440]   - Cooper was an outstanding athlete with the Ole Miss.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.960]   As a wide receiver on scholarship,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.080]   we played together in high school one year.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.160]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.800]   You grew up playing in the backyard with your brother,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.000]   drawing plays in the dirt.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   Now you get to play on a real football field with him.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   So I had a neck injury there when he was in two-a-days
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.160]   at Ole Miss, his freshman year.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   Had to give up his career.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.440]   That was tough.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   He handled it extremely well.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.760]   It had a big impact on me.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.280]   Life when I went through my injuries,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   just Cooper handled it with grace.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.600]   He had a good attitude about it.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.560]   - He's a doctor now, right?
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.880]   - So, no, I am not gonna tell him
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.600]   that you actually thought he was a doctor,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.360]   'cause he probably thinks he could do that as well.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.320]   No, Cooper's doing very good.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.160]   He's got a great family.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.360]   Been very successful in business,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.920]   and he just, he handled it, right?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.600]   So it was a fun way to grow up, having two brothers.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.640]   You got an older brother to kinda look up to
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.880]   and kinda help me out, and then Eli was five years
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.800]   younger than me, so it was a fun way to grow up.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.040]   - Did you guys have any, I have four brothers,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.120]   four younger brothers.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.520]   Did you guys have any fights growing up?
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.760]   - Yeah, I mean, Eli was probably too young
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.040]   to kinda be able to play one-on-one basketball
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   growing up as kids.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.080]   Cooper and I certainly went at it a little more,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.360]   but we always try to get along kind of in the end
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.680]   and kinda have each other's backs,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.760]   which I think's a good thing to do with your siblings.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.200]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.520]   Man, so one thing that I've always admired about you
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.960]   is just your leadership qualities.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.720]   You can see it on the floor, you hear about it,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.600]   it's something that's always, when you talk
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.120]   about Peyton Manning, it's his leadership.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.960]   What are the leadership qualities you feel like
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.100]   you kinda possessed, and how did you kinda get
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.700]   to the point where you could execute those?
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.920]   - Yeah, I mean, I think being a leader,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.760]   look, just because you're the point guard
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   or the quarterback doesn't automatically
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.040]   make you the leader, right?
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.200]   I think you gotta earn kinda being a leader.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.000]   And so I kinda learned the hard way in college.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.200]   First time I got in the huddle, I kinda went in
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.620]   with this rah-rah speech, and a bunch of seniors
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.120]   are just like, "Hey, don't talk, just call the play.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.960]   "It's all we're gonna do."
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   And so you kinda learn that.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.320]   It was a pretty good lesson that you wanna earn,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.200]   I think, the respect of the people
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.280]   that you're trying to lead, right,
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.660]   before you start barking orders and telling 'em what to do.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.640]   I think the other thing I do, at least I thought
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.560]   I tried to do a good job of, is I was tough on myself.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.280]   I was vocal about that, right?
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   If I missed a throw, I would kinda say it out loud,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.160]   like, "Hey, that's a bad throw, that's a horrible decision.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.000]   "No excuse."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.840]   And so I think when my teammates heard
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.280]   that I was tough on myself, that if I was told them,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.340]   "Hey, look, this route needs to be 16 yards, right?
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.920]   "You're going 14, it needs to be,"
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.360]   that it was all fair, right?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.480]   I wasn't picking on anybody, 'cause I was hard on myself,
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   and I just believed in getting the little things right,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   that the little details mattered in a football game,
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.200]   that 14 yards was different than 16 yards.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.800]   It might be the difference in the incompletion
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.860]   or an interception.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.320]   So I felt like I put the work in.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.720]   I wasn't gonna ask anybody to do anything
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.160]   that I wasn't already doing myself.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.000]   And so, and I felt like I admitted
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.040]   when I made a mistake, threw an interception.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.580]   I thought, I tried to be accountable.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.960]   So I think those are some of the best things
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   a leader can do is letting everybody know,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.640]   "Hey, I'm riding this thing with you."
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.480]   - Right, accountability.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.760]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   - There's a picture of you with your foot,
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.400]   like you've been in a hot tub or a cold tub,
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.960]   you got your helmet on, you're watching something.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.240]   Talk about that, because I mean,
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.380]   obviously you're a detailed person.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.480]   I think you were injured at that time.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.320]   - Right, yeah.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.200]   - And I wanna know the backstory on that picture.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.880]   - Yeah, I guess it's the all-time multi-tasker.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.760]   You know, when you're hurt, it's tough,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.300]   'cause a lot of times the best time to rehab
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.380]   is like during practice, right?
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.020]   You know, you have kind of one-on-one time
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.300]   in the athletic training room.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.340]   And so, the team was out practicing,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.180]   and the quarterbacks have an earpiece in their helmets
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.780]   where the coach calls the play into the helmet.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.180]   And so, I wanted to be at practice,
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   but I had to do some, yeah, I had kind of foot problems.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.060]   I was doing cold and ice tub on my foot,
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.700]   so I had my helmet on,
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.340]   where I could still hear the plays being called.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.660]   I could kind of visualize the play,
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.140]   and I had my iPad where I was studying
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.940]   some film of the team.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.700]   So, yeah, multi-tasking, and camera caught me.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   - When I think of intentionality and focus,
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.340]   and in the basketball space, you think of Kobe.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.060]   You know, you think of just his intentional detail,
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.060]   and then in football, I think of you.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.020]   Was that, besides that level of intentionality,
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.860]   what else do you think separated you
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.260]   kind of from the rest of, you know, quarterbacks,
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.260]   but just players in general?
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.180]   Like, what was the main things that set you apart?
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.580]   - Yeah, you know, it's kind of always been,
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.300]   I feel like that's kind of hard for me to answer.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.780]   You know, I always felt like sometimes when a teammate
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.500]   that played with you also went and played for other teams,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.940]   you know, they could give a comparison, right?
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.940]   So, I never knew if I was doing anything different,
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.460]   you know, than anybody else.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.380]   Look, I took, I had great respect and appreciation
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.740]   for the cerebral part of the game.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.340]   You know, I wasn't gonna outrun anybody
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.460]   or throw it, you know, 80 yards down the field,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.500]   so I felt like I had to out-prepare 'em,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.940]   and I felt like the film study,
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.820]   the communication with my receivers,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.180]   being a, just having the master knowledge of the playbook,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.820]   that really helped me, right?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.100]   So, when I got out there on Sundays,
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.300]   or Saturdays in college, or Friday nights in high school,
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.980]   I felt like I'd kind of out-prepared the opponent,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.060]   whether I had or I hadn't, I kind of told myself
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.220]   that, hey, nobody has worked harder for me
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.940]   to get ready for this game.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.900]   That just gave me a little more confidence
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.260]   out there on Sundays.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.140]   And look, the game of football moves so fast,
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.420]   so I don't care how fast you are, how strong your arm is,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.820]   if you don't understand everything about what you're doing
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.300]   as an offense, and also understand
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.620]   what the defense is doing, it moves even faster.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.900]   So, that's kind of where I felt like I could get an edge
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.980]   on the competition.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.020]   Yeah, just the mental side of it.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.700]   I felt like I played, you mentioned those guys,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.100]   Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne,
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.340]   like I played with a lot of the same guys
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.660]   for a number of years, right?
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.500]   So we had good continuity, we weren't startin' over.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.780]   I played in the same offensive system,
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.820]   pretty much the same every single year.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.340]   Denver had changed here a little bit,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.180]   but Tom Brady played in the same system
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.380]   in New England all those years.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.020]   I mean, when you're having to change plays
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.620]   for a quarterback every single year,
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.980]   that's hard, that's tough.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.740]   And so, I was fortunate, I had a great support system,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.180]   great coaches to help me, and players,
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.380]   we played together for a while.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.900]   So I think all those things kinda helped.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.780]   - So routine-wise, specifically,
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.380]   obviously you've got your game day routine,
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.260]   we have our game day routines.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.460]   I feel like the off days sometimes are the days
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.740]   where you can gain that extra ground.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.180]   What would that specifically look like?
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.300]   Like how much film and how much of that mental work,
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.100]   I don't know if it was meditation, film work,
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.260]   or whatever it was, were you actually doing?
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.220]   - Yeah, it's been seven years now,
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.020]   so you're making me go back to,
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.540]   I probably don't have the exact itinerary
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.660]   of what I used to do on Tuesdays,
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.500]   but there's no doubt that I was trying to use Tuesdays,
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.220]   which is the universal off day in the NFL,
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.580]   to try to get ahead, right?
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.780]   And so I was a big believer in watching
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.180]   kind of the game film opponents,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.620]   like their past four games,
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.980]   I was gonna watch those four games
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.860]   and get a good feel for kinda who that team was
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.540]   and what their identity was on defense.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.340]   And then with the coaches, you watch kinda different film.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.140]   I watched a lot of film myself, right?
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.420]   I mean, I watched practice hard, watched the game hard,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.620]   watched, we filmed all the individual drills, right?
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.020]   I think sometimes you get caught up into,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.460]   hey, let's try to figure out these great plays to run,
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.620]   that we're getting ready to play this team,
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.140]   and all of a sudden, your mechanics are off,
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.060]   you're not finishing your throw,
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.940]   you're not finishing your shot,
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.700]   and so it doesn't matter if the play is great
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.780]   if you're not doing your deal.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.900]   So I'm studying a lot of that.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.460]   I think, and you get into that routine,
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.340]   I mean, I think your question is great.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.220]   I think it's important to have a routine, right?
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.580]   And to kinda write down what that routine is
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.420]   and not just sort of wing it every single day.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.500]   - Honestly, like for the majority of my life,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.140]   that's kinda how I've lived,
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.460]   like kinda just like free flow throughout the day,
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.560]   and then I've recently understood the importance
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.980]   of just intentionality.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.300]   Like you said, writing down the routine,
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.740]   waking up at this time, what are you doing at this time?
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.180]   And you still are a very intentional person.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.740]   Like I'll hit you, I'll text you, like when can we talk?
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.340]   You'll be like, next Sunday at 11 a.m.,
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.540]   like I'll be like--
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.780]   - 11.03 to be specific, yeah.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.780]   - Do you still live with that same intentionality?
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.620]   And why is that?
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.260]   - Yeah, that drives my family crazy, just so you know.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.260]   So I probably could do a little better on that,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.820]   of being a little more free flowing in this second chapter.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.100]   But I think it's just like playing football those years,
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.820]   I mean, that's how you just kinda get wired,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.060]   that you, like an eight o'clock meeting
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.100]   means it's gonna be an eight o'clock meeting, right?
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.500]   I mean, football, you do not wanna walk into a meeting
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.700]   at 8.02, 'cause that's late, and everybody's in there.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.860]   So you kinda learn that, so you kinda get on time,
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.900]   and you get a schedule.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.100]   So I feel like it serves you well for the most part.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.500]   Like I said, it can probably annoy your family,
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.820]   and annoy your friends on a golf trip,
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.580]   when, I said specifically we're gonna have breakfast
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.420]   at 7.07, right?
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.220]   That's probably a little much, but look,
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.220]   I think just trying to be, goes back to that routine,
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.860]   I think it helps when you kinda have a plan.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.860]   - I agree.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.660]   I'm super curious about your second Super Bowl with Denver.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.060]   That was after your injuries, correct?
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.540]   - Correct.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.020]   - And obviously I've had my own injuries,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.460]   so I look at that, and I'm like,
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.020]   he made it all the way back to Super Bowl status.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.660]   Post injuries, was there a lot of limitations in your arm,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.100]   and how did you kinda work through that?
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.400]   You said Eli, Cooper, you said helped you.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.820]   - Yeah, well, just the fact that,
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.860]   I think when you go through an injury,
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.700]   go through a tough time,
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.580]   I think having a good attitude is important.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.300]   And that's easier said than done, right?
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.500]   I mean, you're not gonna be super happy
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.940]   that you're hurt, and you're not playing,
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.220]   but there's a reason it happened,
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.100]   and it's kind of a test, you know?
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.540]   Are you gonna handle that test?
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.040]   Are you gonna pass that test?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.780]   So I try to have an upbeat attitude.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.220]   I think that probably helped
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.100]   in kinda getting over those injuries,
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.460]   and kinda healing a little bit,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.660]   that I was, you know, I had a lot of people help me,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.060]   teammates supporting me, that made a difference.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.860]   But I think you just learn that you can't,
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.900]   you know, maybe do certain things that you used to do,
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.740]   but you can adjust and still figure out how to do it,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.140]   I think is kinda the key.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.020]   So, you know, I was fortunate to come here and play,
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.220]   and like I said, have four years,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.020]   and still continue to deal with some other injuries.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.980]   You know, when I got here,
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.020]   and had great teammates and coaches,
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.420]   but, you know, I think being,
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.300]   learning to adapt to post-injuries is important.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.300]   - 100%.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.060]   You say you feel like there was a reason for it,
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.140]   and I feel like a lot of people,
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.760]   when things happen to them, they can't figure it out.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.260]   They don't even just,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.020]   they don't have that faith that there was a reason.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.780]   Do you have like a faith, just like in that aspect?
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.620]   Do you, you know?
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.620]   - Sure, no, certainly not.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.340]   I think it's a great test of your faith,
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.900]   and I felt like when I went through my injuries,
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.660]   look, I was frustrated, I was disappointed,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.420]   but I felt like it was a good Lord's plan that,
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   hey, you know, you're next gonna have some problems,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.700]   and you're not gonna play this year.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.020]   And so, it's a test, it's a test of your faith, you know,
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.700]   and to see if you can kinda trust that it's His plan,
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.100]   and kinda a little bit outta your hands.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.460]   So, I definitely think that's a part of it,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.020]   and look, you know, overcoming adversity,
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.700]   overcoming tough times,
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.160]   if you play sports long enough, you know,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.260]   that's gonna happen, and you better learn to do it.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.580]   And I think having people around you
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.500]   to help you overcome it, you know, is also important.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.900]   But I think, you know, praying about it,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.860]   and kinda trusting in the man upstairs,
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.180]   His plan is probably the best way to overcome it.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.540]   - Have you always had that faith in God?
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.380]   Like, what are you, Christian?
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.500]   Christian, you've always had that?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.100]   - Yeah, yeah. - Sure.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.980]   - So, man, my last question for you is,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.980]   like I said, like you're an idol of mine,
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.020]   Kobe, some of these great, Michael Jordan,
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.900]   what is your way of defining greatness?
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.900]   How would you define it?
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.420]   'Cause everyone doesn't have the physical capabilities
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.500]   to be the best.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.100]   - Yeah. - How would you define it?
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.600]   - I don't know, I, you know,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.100]   probably never really thought about that as much,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.900]   and, you know, I think you just,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.780]   I always tried to be, you know, football,
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.620]   I always liked team sports, right?
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.020]   I played basketball, I played golf with my buddies,
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.980]   but never, you know, competed in golf,
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.940]   but I always thought, like you kinda had an obligation,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.380]   if you signed up for the team,
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.220]   to do everything you could to help the team
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.060]   and be your best for the team, right?
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.220]   And I think that's what always just kinda drove me,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.180]   that I knew people were counting on me, right?
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.420]   I mean, in football, that's your teammates,
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.100]   that's your coaches, look, that's the support staff,
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.380]   you know, the equipment managers, the video directors,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.820]   you know, when, if you don't play well
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.700]   and they fire the coach, a lot of times they fire,
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.460]   you know, a lot of people along with that, right?
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.060]   So, yeah, I'm not saying people's jobs were counting on me,
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.700]   but I think, you know, people were counting on me,
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.300]   fans, right, they're invested into the team, you know,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.540]   and the owner who drafted you, I mean, you wanna,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.140]   I mean, you wanna, the draft's coming up in the NFL,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.340]   and I remember when the coach drafted me,
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.060]   I wanted to give our owner, you know,
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.620]   I wanted to make him proud of his decision to draft me,
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.980]   right, it's a, when they draft you,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.060]   it's not really a reward, it's kind of a,
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.660]   hey, we're gonna bring you to the team,
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.100]   we expect you to do some things for us, right?
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.020]   And I think that's a good mentality,
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.620]   and so, I guess that's what I thought about,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.060]   so I never used the word greatness
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.020]   in describing myself or was necessarily thinking about that,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.620]   I was just thinking about,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.020]   I wanted to do my part, right, you know, for the team,
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.740]   and I think that's why I worked really hard
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.820]   to try to do that, and whatever came along with that,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.220]   you know, it wasn't all perfect,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.900]   we had certainly disappointing losses
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.300]   and, you know, heartbreaking moments,
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.460]   but I think you're, you kind of learn how to handle that,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.380]   and maybe you come out of it stronger on the other side.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.220]   - Well, man, I appreciate you, bro, like I said,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.700]   it means a lot that you would even make the time
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.100]   to come over here and do this with me,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.020]   yeah, I appreciate you getting on the podcast, my man.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.580]   - Hey, you bet, thanks for having me,
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.580]   good luck in the playoffs. - Appreciate you, appreciate you.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.420]   That's a wrap.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.940]   ♪ The names of P.J. ♪
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.820]   - Go watch three plays
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.980]   and get Peyton Manning's perspective on these plays.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.260]   - If I remember, yeah, that's a--
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.660]   - It's a minute, it's definitely a minute ago.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.900]   All right, let's go.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.780]   - I do remember that play,
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.300]   that was the first play of the game.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.660]   I was down in New Orleans, we lost that game.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.700]   We got Marcus Pollard, who was a good teammate of mine,
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.380]   good buddy of mine, but, you know,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.620]   you don't throw many touchdowns
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.540]   on the first play of the game.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.660]   Usually, you call it a play to try to get a completion,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.140]   right, and just kind of had the perfect play
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.300]   at the perfect time, called, and he took it for 80 yards, so.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.660]   - 80 yards, first play of the game.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.460]   This was against Baltimore.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.740]   This is an interesting scenario,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.860]   that Baltimore had won the Super Bowl the year before,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.900]   and they didn't get to open up at home
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.780]   because of like a scheduling conflict
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.540]   with their baseball team in town.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.460]   So they had to come--
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.700]   - Yeah, I was smacking them.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.180]   - They had to open their, defend their title here in Denver,
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.860]   and so, which probably wasn't fair,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.540]   but yeah, that was just a go-route to Demarius Thomas,
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.300]   who, God rest his soul, we lost last year.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.020]   He was my good buddy, and that wasn't,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.540]   that's more on him than me, Mike.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.780]   That's just throwing it up to him and letting him,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.620]   letting him do his thing.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.460]   - Was he tall?
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.280]   Was he tall? - Yeah, he was a big guy,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.120]   for sure.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.060]   - We're all the way at 49.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.920]   We need to go to the top.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.900]   - Yeah, these are outdated now.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.420]   This is at the time to break the all-time touchdown record.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.900]   I think Breeze and Brady have broken that record
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.940]   several times since then, so.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.780]   - Oh, really?
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.860]   - But at the time, Brett Favre had the all-time
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.980]   touchdown record, and so, that pass was to break it,
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.940]   but what I liked about it is that we won the game.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.380]   You know, we weren't doing anything
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.840]   just to try to build a record, right?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.680]   - Did that get tipped?
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.600]   - Kind of a close game.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.460]   No, I threw a lot of wobbly passes, Mike.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.300]   - Oh, did you?
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.520]   - It just looked like they got tipped,
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.820]   but I appreciate you asking that.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.020]   No, so that was cool, yeah.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.700]   I mean, it was still in the second quarter,
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.460]   so we broke the record and kind of got that over with,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.220]   and went on to win the game, but I love quarterbacks.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.940]   Yeah, they played keep-away with me
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.560]   from the football afterwards, so.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.700]   This is in the Super Bowl.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.740]   This was against the Bears,
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.060]   and the Bears actually kind of screwed up the coverage.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.220]   He was pretty open.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.580]   It was a matter of kind of getting to him, so.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.940]   Down in the rain, down in Miami,
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.340]   so that's always a fun one to watch.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.740]   It was, you know, first championship for the Colts,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.820]   so it was fun to be a part of that.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.180]   First championship for Indianapolis,
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.260]   so it was fun to be a part of that.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.660]   - Dope, man, appreciate you.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.980]   Legendary, top 50 legendary players.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.820]   Appreciate you, my guy.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.980]   - You got it, man, appreciate it.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.820]   Thanks for having me.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.180]   All right, man, all the best.
