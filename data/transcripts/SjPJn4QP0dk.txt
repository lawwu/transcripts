[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.020]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.660]   Let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity,
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.580]   this incredible feature of our nervous system
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.800]   that allows it to change itself in response to experience,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.960]   and even in ways that we consciously
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.240]   and deliberately decide to change it.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.120]   Most people don't know how to access neuroplasticity,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.080]   and so that's what this entire month
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   of the Huberman Lab podcast has been about.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   We've explored neuroplasticity
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.940]   from a variety of different perspectives.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.920]   We talked about representational plasticity.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.660]   We talked about the importance of focus and reward.
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.000]   We talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.620]   of the vestibular system,
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.400]   how altering our relationship to gravity,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.120]   and in addition to that, making errors, as we try and learn,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.320]   can open up windows to plasticity.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.300]   But we have not really talked so much
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.480]   about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.680]   and thus far, we really haven't talked yet
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.800]   about how to undo things that we don't want.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.240]   And so today, we are going to explore
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   that aspect of neuroplasticity,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.320]   and we are going to do that in the context
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.160]   which is pain, and in some cases,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.260]   injury to the nervous system.
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.240]   We, as always here on this podcast,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.040]   are going to discuss some of the science,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   we get into mechanism,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.840]   but we also really get at principles.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.600]   Principles are far more important than any one experiment
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.220]   or one description of mechanism,
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.300]   and certainly far more important than any one protocol,
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.180]   because principles allow you to think
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420]   about your nervous system and work with it
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.400]   in ways that best serve you.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.880]   So let's start our discussion about pain
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.140]   and the somatosensory system.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.720]   The somatosensory system is, as the name implies,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.960]   involved in understanding touch,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.480]   physical feeling on our body.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   And the simplest way to think
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.280]   about the somatosensory system
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.800]   is that we have little sensors,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.060]   and those sensors come in the form of neurons, nerve cells,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.480]   that reside in our skin
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.660]   and in the deeper layers below the skin.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.160]   We have some that correspond to,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.760]   and we should say respond to mechanical touch.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.680]   So, you know, pressure on the top of my hand,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.480]   or a pinpoint, or other sensors, for instance,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.760]   respond to heat, to cold.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.680]   Some respond to vibration.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.400]   We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000]   and they take that information
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   and send it down these wires that we call axons
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.740]   in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.140]   and then up to the brain.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.680]   And within the spinal cord and brain,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.560]   we have centers that interpret that information,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720]   that actually make sense of those electrical signals.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.580]   And this is amazing because none of those sensors
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.880]   has a different, unique form of information that it uses.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.660]   It just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.580]   Pain and the sensation of pain is, believe it or not,
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.580]   a controversial word in the neuroscience field.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.360]   People prefer to use the word nociception.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.700]   Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.220]   that detect particular types of stimuli.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.220]   It actually comes from the Latin word nocera,
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.540]   which means to harm.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.060]   And why would neuroscientists not want to talk about pain?
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.820]   Well, it's very subjective.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.380]   It has a mental component and a physical component.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.500]   We cannot say that pain is simply an attempt
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.260]   to avoid physical harm to the body.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.700]   And here's why.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.460]   They actually can be dissociated from one another.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.100]   And there's a famous case that was published
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.180]   in the British Journal of Medicine
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.780]   where a construction worker,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.060]   I think he fell, is how the story went,
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.060]   and a 14-inch nail went through his boot
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.620]   and up through the boot.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.640]   And he was in excruciating pain,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.860]   just beyond anything he'd experienced.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.220]   He reported that he couldn't even move in any dimension,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.140]   even a tiny bit, without feeling excruciating pain.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.200]   They brought him into the clinic, into the hospital.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.900]   They were able to cut away the boot,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.600]   and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.940]   and it had actually not impaled the skin at all.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.980]   His visual image of the nail going through his boot
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.920]   gave him the feeling, the legitimate feeling,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.020]   that he was experiencing the pain
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.380]   of a nail going through his foot,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.340]   which is incredible because it speaks
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.060]   to the power of the mind in this pain scenario.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.660]   And it also speaks to the power of the specificity.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.700]   It's not like he thought that his foot was on fire.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.860]   He thought because he saw a nail going through his foot,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.700]   well, it was going through his boot,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.560]   but he thought it was going through his foot,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.420]   that it was sharp pain of the sort
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.660]   that a nail would produce.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.200]   It really speaks to the incredible capacity
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.700]   that these top-down,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.660]   these higher-level cognitive functions have
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.820]   in interpreting what we're experiencing out in the periphery,
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.200]   even just on the basis of what we see.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   So why are we talking about pain
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.140]   during a month on neuroplasticity?
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.860]   Well, it turns out that the pain system
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.220]   offers us a number of different principles
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.220]   that we can leverage to A, ensure that if we are ever injured
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.320]   we are able to understand the difference
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.540]   between injury and pain because there is a difference,
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.780]   that if we're ever in pain
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.020]   that we can understand the difference
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.420]   between injury and pain,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.580]   that we will be able to interpret our pain.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.540]   And during the course of today's podcast,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.540]   I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.660]   from both ends of the spectrum,
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.980]   from the periphery at the level of the injury
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.300]   and through these top-down mental mechanisms.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.720]   Believe it or not, we're going to talk about love.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.940]   A colleague of mine at Stanford who runs a major pain clinic
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.780]   is working on and has published quality peer-reviewed data
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.200]   on the role of love in modulating the pain response.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.580]   So what we're talking about today
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.020]   is plasticity of perception,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.300]   which has direct bearing on emotional pain
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.260]   and has direct bearing on trauma.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.880]   So let's get started in thinking about what happens
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.720]   with pain.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.940]   And I will tell you just now that there is a mutation,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.460]   a genetic mutation in a particular sodium channel.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.700]   A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.660]   that allows them to fire action potentials.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.020]   It's important to the function of the neuron.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.860]   It's also important for the development of certain neurons.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.660]   And there's a particular mutation.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.840]   There are kids that are born
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.560]   without this sodium channel 1.7, if you want to look it up.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.100]   Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.780]   And it is a terrible situation.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.020]   They don't tend to live very long due to accidents.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.580]   It's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.120]   In fact, it's reasonable to speculate
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.540]   that one of the reasons, not all,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.720]   but one of the reasons why people might differ
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.440]   in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.660]   in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.320]   People who make too much of this receptor
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.200]   experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.620]   So let's talk about some of the features
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.640]   of how we're built physically and how that relates to pain
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.920]   and how we can recover from injury.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.600]   So, first of all,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.300]   we have maps of our body surface in our brain.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.200]   It's called a homunculus.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.440]   That representation is scaled
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.320]   in a way that matches sensitivity.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   So the areas of your body that are most sensitive
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.300]   have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.840]   Your back is an enormous piece of tissue
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.480]   compared to your fingertip,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.240]   but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.260]   And the representation of your back in your brain
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.160]   is actually pretty small,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.280]   whereas the representation of your finger is enormous.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   So how big a brain area is devoted to a given body part
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.600]   is directly related to the density of receptors
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   in that body part, not the size of the body part.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You can actually know how sensitive a given body part is
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.640]   and how much brain area is devoted to it
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.760]   through what's called two-point discrimination.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   You can do this experiment if you want.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.680]   I think I've described this once or twice before,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.000]   but basically if you have someone put,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.480]   maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.620]   on your back and touch while you're facing away,
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.880]   and they'll ask you how many points they're touching you
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.920]   and you say two,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.360]   but if they move those closer together, say three inches,
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.720]   you're likely to experience it as one point of contact.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.360]   Whereas on your finger, you could play that game all day.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.520]   And as long as there's a millimeter or so spacing,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.800]   you will know that it's two points as opposed to one.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.240]   And that's because there's more pixels,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.620]   more density of receptors.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.400]   This has direct bearing to pain
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.340]   because it says that areas of the body
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.420]   that have denser receptors
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.000]   So just as a rule of thumb,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   areas of your body that are injured,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.320]   that are large areas that have low sensitivity
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   before injury likely are going to experience less pain
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   and the literature shows will heal more slowly
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   because they don't have as many cells around
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.240]   to produce inflammation.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.880]   And you might say, wait, I thought inflammation is bad.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.920]   Well, one of the things I really want to get across today
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.820]   is that inflammation is not bad.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.680]   Inflammation out of control is bad,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.560]   but inflammation is wonderful.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.680]   Inflammation is the tissue repair response.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.440]   I thought it might be a nice time to just think about
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.760]   the relationship between the periphery and the central maps
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.840]   in a way that many of you have probably heard about before,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.120]   which will frame the discussion a little bit better,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.380]   which is phantom limb pain.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.920]   Now, some of you are probably familiar with this,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.720]   or some other portion of their body amputated,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.620]   it's not uncommon for those people to feel
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.140]   as if they still have that limb or appendage
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.240]   or piece of their body intact.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.120]   And typically, unfortunately,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   the sensation of that limb is not one of the limb
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.980]   being nice and relaxed and just there.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.200]   The sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.080]   or is contorted in the specific orientation
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.060]   that it was around the time of the injury.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.080]   So if someone has a blunt force to the hand
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.940]   and they end up having their hand amputated,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.360]   typically they will continue to feel pain
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.400]   in their phantom hand, which is pretty wild.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   And that's because the representation of that hand
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.800]   is still intact in the cortex, in the brain.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.840]   And it's trying to balance its levels of activity.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.800]   Normally it's getting what's called proprioceptive feedback.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.720]   Proprioception is just our knowledge
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.200]   of where our limbs are in space.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.080]   It's an extremely important aspect
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.260]   of our somatosensory system.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.220]   And there's no proprioceptive feedback.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.240]   And so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.480]   their levels of activity
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.820]   and they become very conscious of the phantom limb.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.040]   Now, before my lab was at Stanford,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.160]   I was at UC San Diego.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.240]   And one of my colleagues was a guy,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.160]   everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.480]   who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.840]   and developing a very simple,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.120]   but very powerful solution to it
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.560]   that speaks to the incredible capacity
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.220]   of top-down modulation.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.440]   And top-down modulation,
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.160]   the ability to use one's brain cognition and senses
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.600]   to control pain in the body
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.160]   is something that everyone,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.780]   not just people missing limbs or in chronic pain
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.800]   can learn to benefit from
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.160]   because it is a way to tap into our ability
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.760]   to use our mind to control perceptions
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.400]   of what's happening in our body.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.420]   So what did Ramachandran do?
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.420]   Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.880]   put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.760]   such that when they looked in the box
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.480]   and they moved their intact limb,
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.600]   the opposite limb, which was a reflection of the intact limb
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.300]   'cause they're missing the opposite limb,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.280]   they would see it as if it was intact.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.360]   And as they would move their intact limb,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.040]   they would visualize with their eyes
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.700]   the limb that's in the place of the absent limb,
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.160]   so this is all by mirrors,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.800]   moving around and they would feel immediate relief
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   from the phantom pain.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   And he would tell them and they would direct their hand
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.700]   toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.440]   Then they would exit the mirror box,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.060]   they would take their hand out
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.140]   and they would feel as if the hand was now
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.720]   in its relaxed, normal position.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.480]   So you could get real time in moments
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.360]   remapping of the representation of the hand.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.480]   Now that's amazing.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.800]   This is the kind of thing that all of us
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.020]   would like to be able to do if we are in pain,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.480]   because if you do anything for long enough, including live,
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.680]   you're going to experience pain of some sort.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.520]   And this, again, I just want to remind you
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   isn't just about physical injuries and pain,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.640]   this has direct relevance to emotional pain as well,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.080]   which we, of course, we'll talk about.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.800]   So the Ramachandran studies were really profound
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.040]   because they said a couple of things.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.720]   One, plasticity can be very fast,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.400]   that it can be driven by the experience of something,
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.460]   just the visual experience.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.920]   And so this may come as a shock to some of you
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.840]   and by no means am I trying to be insensitive,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.720]   but pain is a perceptual thing
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.640]   as much as it's a physical thing.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.500]   It's a belief system about what you're experiencing
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.340]   in your body.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.920]   And that has important relevance
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   for healing different types of injury
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.400]   and the pain associated with that injury.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.480]   Now, this brings up another topic,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.160]   which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.600]   but is a more general one that I hear about a lot,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.040]   which is traumatic brain injury.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.540]   Many injuries are not just about the limb
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.600]   and the lack of use of the limb,
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.680]   but concussion and head injury.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.820]   But I want to talk a little bit about what is known
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.540]   about recovery from concussion.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.640]   And this is very important
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.000]   because it has implications for just normal aging as well,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.660]   and offset setting some of the cognitive decline
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.220]   and physical decline that occurs with normal aging.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.440]   Typically after TBI,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.120]   there's a constellation of symptoms
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.680]   that many people, if not all people with TBI report,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   which is headache, photophobia,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.480]   that lights become kind of aversive,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.880]   sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.280]   sometimes mood issues.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.540]   There's a huge range,
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.940]   and of course the severity will vary, et cetera.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.680]   It's very clear that regardless of whether or not
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.800]   there was a skull break,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.040]   and regardless of when the TBI happened
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.240]   and how many times it's happened,
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.020]   that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.020]   is mainly centered around this lymphatic system
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.200]   that we call for the brain, the glymphatic system.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.880]   It's sort of like a sewer system
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.000]   that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   especially injured neurons.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   And the glymphatic system is very active during sleep.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.920]   And the glymphatic system is something
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.300]   that you want very active
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.100]   because it's going to clear away the debris
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.240]   that sits between the neurons.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.320]   And the cells that surround the connections
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.760]   between the neurons called the glia,
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.600]   those cells are actively involved
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.840]   in repairing the connections
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.480]   between neurons when damaged.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.220]   So the glymphatic system is so important
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.120]   that many people, if not all people who get TBI,
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.080]   are told get adequate rest, you need to sleep.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.440]   And that's kind of twofold advice.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.520]   On the one hand, it's telling you to get sleep
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.600]   because all these good things happen in sleep.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.480]   It's also about getting those people
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.200]   to not continue to engage in their activity full-time
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.240]   or really try and hammer through it.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.160]   The glymphatic system has been shown
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.760]   to be activated further in two ways.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   One is that sleeping on one side, not on back or stomach,
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   seems to increase the amount of wash out,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.520]   or wash through, I should say, of the glymphatic system.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.200]   The other thing that has been shown
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.080]   to improve the function of the glymphatic system
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.480]   is a certain form of exercise.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   And I want to be very, very clear here.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.060]   I will never, and I am not suggesting
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.060]   that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.040]   or that goes against their physician's advice.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.600]   However, there's some interesting data
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.880]   that zone two cardio for 30 to 45 minutes,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   three times a week, seems to improve the rates of clearance
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.020]   of some of the debris after injury.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.280]   And in general, injury or no,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.420]   to accelerate and improve the rates of flow
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.180]   for the glymphatic system.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.840]   It could be fast walking.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.160]   It could be jogging.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.300]   If you can do that with your injury safely,
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.460]   it could be cycling.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.760]   And this is really interesting outside of TBI
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.180]   because what we know from aging
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.840]   is that aging is a non-linear process.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.660]   It's not like with every year of life,
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.280]   your brain gets a little older.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.100]   It has, sometimes it follows
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.520]   what's more like a step function.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.160]   Like you get these big jumps in markers of aging.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.860]   I guess that we could think of them as jumps down
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.460]   because it's a negative thing for most everybody
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.220]   would like to live longer and be healthier
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.100]   in brain and body.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.700]   And so the types of exercise I'm referring to now
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.520]   are really more about brain longevity
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.780]   and about keeping the brain healthy
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.840]   than they are about physical fitness.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.240]   So I think this is really interesting.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.340]   And if some of you would like to know the mechanism
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.900]   or at least the hypothesized mechanism,
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.460]   there's a molecule called aquaporin four
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.460]   that is related to the glial system.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.580]   So glia, it means glue in Latin,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.220]   are these cells in the brain,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.200]   the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.980]   that in sheath synapses, but they're very dynamic cells.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.180]   Aquaporin four is mainly expressed by the glial cell
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.360]   called the astrocyte.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.460]   Astro, it looks like a little star.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.200]   Incredibly interesting cells.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.760]   And the thing to remember
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.760]   is that the astrocytes bridge the connection
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.240]   between the neurons, the synapse,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.660]   the connections between them and the vasculature,
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.640]   the blood system and the glymphatic system.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.640]   So this glymphatic system and the glial astrocyte system
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.580]   is a system that we want chronically active
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.680]   throughout the day as much as possible.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.800]   So low-level walking, zone two cardio,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.080]   and then at night during slow wave sleep
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.020]   is when really when this glymphatic system kicks in.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.520]   So that should hopefully be an actionable takeaway
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.180]   provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.440]   that I believe everybody should be doing
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.000]   who cares about brain longevity,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.660]   not just people who are trying to get over TBI.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.280]   Now I'd like to return a little bit
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.520]   to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.980]   because I think it's so interesting and so actionable
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.560]   that everyone should know about this.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.140]   Our interpretation, our subjective interpretation
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.800]   of a sensory event is immensely powerful
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.020]   for dictating our experience of the event.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.760]   The molecule adrenaline, when it's liberated into our body,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.860]   truly blunts our experience of pain.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.600]   We all know the stories of people, you know,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.660]   walking, you know, miles on stumped legs,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.000]   people doing all sorts of things that were incredible feats
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.440]   that allowed them to move through
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.920]   what would otherwise be pain.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.560]   And afterward they do experience extreme pain,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.400]   but during the event,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.200]   oftentimes they are not experiencing pain.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.800]   And that's because of the pain blunting effects
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.920]   of adrenaline.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.880]   Adrenaline binding in particular receptors
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.520]   actually shuts down pain pathways.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.040]   People who anticipate an injection of morphine
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   immediately report the feeling of loss of pain.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.580]   Their pain starts to diminish
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.640]   because they know they're going to get pain relief.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.920]   And it's a powerful effect.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.080]   Now, all of you are probably saying placebo effect.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.840]   Placebo effects are very real.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.920]   Placebo effects and belief effects as they're called
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.280]   have a profound effect on our experience
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.160]   of noxious stimuli like pain.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.800]   And they can also have a profound effect
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.040]   on positive stimuli
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.640]   and things that we're looking forward to.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.480]   One study that I think is particularly interesting here
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.420]   is from my colleague at Stanford, Sean Mackey.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.200]   They did a neuroimaging study.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.640]   They subjected people to pain.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.880]   In this case, it was a heat pain.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.440]   People have very specific thresholds to heat
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.400]   at which they cannot tolerate any more heat,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.420]   but they explored the extent to which looking at an image
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.920]   of somebody, in this case, a romantic partner,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.280]   that the person loved
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.780]   would allow them to adjust their pain response.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.760]   And it turns out it does, they could tolerate more pain.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.620]   And they reported it as not as painful.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.800]   That response, that feeling of love internally
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.360]   can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.000]   These are not small effects.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.400]   And not surprisingly, how early a relationship is,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.720]   how new a relationship is directly correlates
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.920]   with people's ability, they showed,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.280]   to use this love, this internal representation of love,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.600]   to blunt the pain response.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.760]   So for those of you that have been with your partners
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.520]   for many years and you love them very much
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.620]   and you're obsessed with them, terrific.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.880]   You have a pre-installed,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.000]   well, I suppose it's not pre-installed,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.900]   you had to do the work 'cause relationships are work,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.500]   but you've got a installed mechanism for blunting pain.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.860]   And again, these are not minor effects.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   These are major effects.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.360]   And it's all going to be through that top-down modulation
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.020]   that we talked about, not unlike the mirror box experiments
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.660]   with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.460]   or some other top-down modulation
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.740]   in the opposite examples, the nail through the boot,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.920]   which is a visual image that made the person think
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.220]   it was painful when in fact it was painful,
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.420]   even though there was no tissue damage.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.340]   It was all perceptual.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.340]   So the pain system is really subject
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.020]   to these perceptual influences, which is remarkable
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.300]   because really when we think
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.580]   about the somatosensory system,
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.900]   it has this cognitive component,
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.660]   it's got this peripheral component,
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.660]   but there's another component,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.140]   which is the way in which our sensation,
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.820]   our somatosensory system is woven in
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.860]   with our autonomic nervous system.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.940]   Independent of love,
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.500]   we're going to talk about something quite different,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.620]   which is putting needles and electricity
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.120]   in different parts of the body, so-called acupuncture,
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.280]   something that for many people,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.320]   it's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine,
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.560]   but now there are excellent laboratories
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.200]   exploring what's called electroacupuncture and acupuncture.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.760]   And I think what you'll be interested in
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.360]   and surprised to learn is that it does work,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.520]   but sometimes it can exacerbate pain
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.720]   and sometimes it can relieve pain.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.240]   And it all does that through very discrete pathways
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.340]   for which we can really say this neuron connects
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.960]   to that neuron, connects to the adrenals
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.320]   and we can tie this all back to dopamine
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.860]   because in the end, it's the chemicals and neural circuits
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.880]   that are giving rise to these perceptions
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.920]   or these experiences rather of things
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.080]   that we call pain, love, et cetera.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.360]   There are actually a lot of really good peer-reviewed
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.320]   studies supporting the use of acupuncture
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.600]   for in particular GI tract issues.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.100]   In recent years, there's been an emphasis
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.000]   on trying to understand the mechanism
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.840]   of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.520]   but as a way to try and understand
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.640]   how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.440]   who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.880]   or brain-body relationship in general.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.040]   What I want to talk about in terms of acupuncture
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.780]   is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.880]   the crosstalk between the somatosensory system,
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.200]   our ability to feel stuff externally,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.040]   exteroception, internally, interoception,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.880]   and how that somatosensory system is wired in with
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.240]   and communicating with our autonomic nervous system
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.800]   that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.320]   So this takes us all back to the homunculus.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.880]   We have this representation of our body surface
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.100]   in our brain.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.200]   That representation is what we call somatotopic.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   And what somatotopy is, is it just means that areas
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.080]   of your body that are near one another
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.000]   are represented by neurons that are nearby each other
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.480]   in the brain.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.380]   The connections from those brain neurons
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.240]   are sent into the body and they are synchronized with,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.600]   meaning they cross wire with and form synapses
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.640]   with some of the input from the viscera,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.240]   from our spleen, from our heart.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.800]   Our internal organs are sending information up
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.000]   to this map in our brain of the body surface,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.720]   but it's about internal information,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.200]   what we call interoception,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.640]   our ability to look inside or imagine inside
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.900]   and feel what we're feeling inside.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.920]   So the way to think about this accurately
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.540]   is that our representation of ourself
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.500]   is a representation of our internal workings,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.160]   our viscera, our guts, everything inside our skin,
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.400]   and the surface of our skin, and the external world.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.200]   And those three things are always being combined
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.360]   in a very interesting, complex, but very seamless way.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   Acupuncture involves taking needles
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.960]   and sometimes electricity and/or heat as well
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.200]   and stimulating particular locations on the body.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.040]   And if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.620]   like their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.680]   you stimulate this area
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.560]   and it'll slow their gut motility down.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.240]   Or if their gut motility is too slow, they're constipated,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.400]   you stimulate someplace else and it accelerates it.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.960]   And hearing about this, if it sounds kind of to a Westerner
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.000]   who's not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.320]   it could sound kind of wacky.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.960]   But when you look at the neural circuitry,
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.120]   the neuroanatomy, it really starts to make sense.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.960]   Intense stimulation of the abdomen, however,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.780]   with this electroacupuncture has a very strong effect
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.520]   of increasing inflammation in the body.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.680]   And this is important to understand
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.280]   because it's not just that stimulating the gut does this
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.000]   because you're activating the gut area.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.820]   It activates a particular nerve pathway
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.800]   for the aficionados.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.400]   It's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.360]   if you really want to know,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.240]   and it's pro-inflammatory under most conditions.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.000]   If, for instance, the person is dealing
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.040]   with a particular bacterial infection,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.840]   that can be beneficial.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.760]   And this goes back to a much earlier discussion
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.240]   that we had on a previous podcast
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.120]   that we'll revisit again and again,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.820]   which is that the stress response
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.760]   was designed to combat infection.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.920]   So it turns out that there are certain patterns
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.320]   of stimulation on the abdomen
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.480]   that can actually liberate immune cells
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   from our immune organs, like our spleen,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.160]   and counter infection.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.040]   When you stimulate these pathways
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   that activate in particular the adrenals,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.560]   the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.240]   and the brain does as well,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.260]   it binds to what are called
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.640]   the beta noradrenergic receptors.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.600]   Okay, so this is really getting kind of down into the weeds,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   but the beta noradrenergic receptors activate the spleen,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.000]   which liberate cells that combat infection.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.720]   That's the short-term quick response.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.920]   The more intense stimulation of the abdomen
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.080]   and other areas can be pro-inflammatory
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.000]   because of the ways that they trigger certain loops
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.440]   that go back to the brain
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.640]   and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.400]   that exacerbates pain.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.520]   So one pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts pain,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.960]   the other one doesn't.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.000]   What does all this mean?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.040]   How are we supposed to put all of this together?
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.360]   Well, there's a paper that was published
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.200]   in "Nature Medicine" in 2014,
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   this is an excellent journal,
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.320]   that describes how dopamine
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.920]   can activate the vagus peripherally
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.880]   and norepinephrine can activate the vagus peripherally
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.040]   and reduce inflammation.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.120]   What this means is that there are real maps
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.400]   of our body surface that when stimulated,
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.920]   communicate with our autonomic nervous system,
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   the system that controls alertness or calmness,
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.360]   and thereby releases either molecules
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.760]   like norepinephrine and dopamine,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.800]   which make us more alert and blunt our response to pain,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.680]   and they reduce inflammation.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   But there are yet other pathways
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.000]   that when stimulated are pro-inflammatory.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.560]   One of the things that bothers me so much these days,
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.040]   and I'm not easily irritated,
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   but what really bothers me
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.360]   is when people are talking about inflammation,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.480]   like inflammation is bad.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.760]   Inflammation is terrific.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.160]   Inflammation is the reason why cells are called
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.040]   to the site of injury to clear it out.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   Inflammation is what's going to allow you
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.760]   to heal from any injury.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.960]   Chronic inflammation is bad,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.840]   but acute inflammation is absolutely essential.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.800]   Remember those kids that we talked about earlier
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.720]   that have mutations in these receptors
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.040]   that for sensing pain, they never get inflammation.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.120]   And that's why their joints literally disintegrate.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.100]   It's really horrible
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.660]   because they don't actually have the inflammation response
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.720]   because it was never triggered by the pain response.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.560]   So I think that the data on acupuncture
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.640]   are turning out to be very interesting.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.520]   Before I continue,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.080]   I just thought I'd answer a question that I get a lot,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.140]   which is what about Wim Hof breathing?
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.720]   Wim Hof, also called aka the Iceman,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.640]   has this breathing that's similar to TUMO breathing,
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.760]   as it was originally called,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.560]   involves basically hyperventilating
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.400]   and then doing some exhales and some breath holds.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.560]   A number of people have asked me about it
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.560]   in relation to pain management.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.800]   The effect of doing that kind of breathing,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.040]   it's not a mysterious effect.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.360]   It liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.240]   When you have adrenaline in your system
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.080]   and when the spleen is very active,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.760]   that response is used to counter infection
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.560]   and stress counters infection
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.440]   by liberating killer cells in the body.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.560]   You don't want the stress response
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.780]   to stay on indefinitely, however.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.520]   Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.000]   anything that releases adrenaline
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.640]   will counter the infection.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.780]   But you want to regulate the duration
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.100]   of that adrenaline response.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.800]   Today, we've talked about a variety of tools,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.560]   but I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.700]   that hopefully you won't need,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.980]   but presumably if you're a human being and you're active,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.520]   you will need at some point.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   It's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   or at least as fast as possible.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   It includes removing the pain.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.440]   It includes getting mobility back
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.800]   and getting back to a normal life,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.560]   whatever that means for you.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.760]   I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about next
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.360]   was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.600]   who many of you probably have heard of before.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.360]   Kelly can be found at The Ready State.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.800]   He's a formally trained,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.220]   so degreed and educated exercise physiologist.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.560]   He's a world expert in movement and tissue rehabilitation.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.520]   So I asked Kelly, I made it really simple.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.580]   I said, okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.940]   or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.640]   or something like that, or shoulder injury.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.480]   What are the absolute necessary things to do
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.920]   regardless of situation?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.840]   So the first one is a very basic one
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.080]   that now you have a lot of information to act on,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.440]   which is sleep is essential.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.480]   And so we both agreed eight hours of sleep would be ideal,
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.640]   but if not at least eight hours immobile.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.840]   So that's a non-negotiable
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.160]   in terms of getting the foundation
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.220]   for allowing for glymphatic clearance
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.860]   and tissue clearance, et cetera.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.660]   The other is, if possible,
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.320]   unless it's absolutely excruciating
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.760]   where you just can't do it, a 10 minute walk per day.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.840]   Of course, you don't want to exacerbate the injury,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.680]   at least a 10 minute walk per day and probably longer.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.900]   This is where it gets interesting.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.460]   I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself,
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.760]   you're supposed to ice something,
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.840]   you're supposed to put ice on it.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.040]   But I didn't realize this,
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.800]   but when speaking to exercise physiologists
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.980]   and some physicians,
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.800]   they said that the ice is really more of a placebo.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.900]   It numbs the environment of the injury,
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.940]   which is not surprising,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.820]   and will eliminate the pain for a short while,
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.180]   but it has some negative effects
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.740]   that perhaps offset its use.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.180]   It actually can create some like clotting and sludging
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.780]   of the tissue and fluids,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.620]   which is bad because you want the macrophages
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.380]   and the other cell types phagocytosing,
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.900]   eating up the debris and injury
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.180]   and moving it out of there so that it can repair.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.420]   So that was surprising to me,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.580]   which made me ask, well, then what about heat?
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.880]   Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.980]   The major effects seem to be explained
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.560]   by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.700]   and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid,
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.180]   blood, lymph, and other fluids out of the injury area.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.620]   So all of this might sound just like common sense knowledge.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.060]   I always just thought it's ice,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.580]   it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.700]   it's things that block prostaglandins,
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.200]   so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.340]   those things generally work by blocking things
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.340]   like they're called the Cox prostaglandin blockers
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.020]   and things of that sort, things in that pathway.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.340]   Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.760]   may not be so great at the beginning
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.260]   when you want inflammation,
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.360]   they may be important for limiting pain
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.300]   so people can be functional at all.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.540]   But the things that I talked about today
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.080]   really are anchored in three principles.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.820]   One is that the inflammation response is a good one,
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.600]   it calls to the site of injury,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.500]   things that are going to clean up the injury in bad cells.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.580]   Then there are going to be things
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.180]   that are going to improve perfusion
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.440]   like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.300]   feet elevated, sleeping on one side,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.340]   low level zone two cardio three times a week.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.940]   Many people ask me about platelet-rich plasma,
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.580]   so-called PRP.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.860]   They take blood, they enrich for platelets
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.040]   and then they re-inject it back into people.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   Here's the deal, it has never been shown
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.320]   whether or not the injection itself
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.080]   is what's actually creating the effect.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.140]   The claims that PRP actually contains stem cells
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.040]   are very, very feeble.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.320]   And when you look at the literature
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.400]   and you talk to anyone expert in the stem cell field,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.600]   they will tell you that the number of stem cells in PRP
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.520]   is infinitesimally small.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.880]   Stem cells are an exciting area of technology.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   However, there's a clinic down in Florida
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.760]   that was shut down a couple of years ago
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.240]   for injecting stem cells harvested from patients
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.020]   into the eye for macular degeneration.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.380]   These were people that were suffering from poor vision.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.340]   And very shortly after injecting these stem cells
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.560]   into the eyes, they went completely blind.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.280]   And I'm not here to tell you that you should
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.160]   or shouldn't do something,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.640]   but I do think that anything involving stem cells,
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.200]   one should be very cautious of.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.940]   The major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.000]   is that stem cells are cells
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.020]   that want to become lots of different things,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.800]   not just the tissue that you're interested in.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.780]   So if you damage your knee
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.840]   and you inject stem cells into your knee,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.480]   you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.380]   so that they don't become tumor cells, right?
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.000]   A tumor is a collection of stem cells.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.840]   One needs to approach this with extreme caution,
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.080]   even if it's your own blood
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.440]   or stem cells that you're re-injecting.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.800]   So I'm going to close there.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.560]   I've talked about a lot of tools today.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.680]   I've talked a lot about somatosensation,
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.320]   about plasticity, about pain, about acupuncture,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.400]   some of the nuance of acupuncture, inflammation, stress.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   We even talked a little bit about high intensity breathing.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.540]   So as always, we take kind of a whirlwind tour
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.900]   through a given topic, lay down some tools as we go.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.120]   Hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury,
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   but also neuroplasticity in general,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.620]   today in the context of the somatosensory system,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.020]   will be of use to all of you.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.780]   I don't wish injury on any of you,
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.000]   but I do hope that you'll take the information,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.400]   do with it what you will.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.040]   Once again, thanks so much for your time
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.160]   and attention today.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.900]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.480]   [upbeat music]
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.060]   (upbeat music)
