[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hello everybody it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.960]   talk about what the Doomer Bears got wrong. So if you've been paying attention
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.600]   to the markets they're up about 25 plus percent since the bottom hit in March
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.840]   and during the March time period when the hysteria was at its height very
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.680]   experienced investors were talking about the S&P falling to like 1500 the Dow
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.800]   Jones Industrial Average falling to 15,000 and instead the markets rebounded
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.280]   quite vigorously. So I wanted to just check out and have a discussion on what
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.160]   happened because nobody has a crystal ball. Look when the hysteria was at its
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.680]   height people were just freaking out nobody really felt very confident at all
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   especially if you turn on the news and you check social media and so forth. If
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.680]   you read the post "How to predict a stock market bottom like Nostradamus" it was
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.800]   published on March 18th. It was my attempt to call the market bottom and
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.640]   predict the market bottom using some rational thought in terms of earnings
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.400]   and valuations. Go through the post if you haven't already. The whole idea of
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.320]   the post was to encourage people to think rationally about earnings
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.880]   valuations and the future. It wasn't so much okay this is exactly how you're
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.720]   going to do the analysis but really it's to help people think through things
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.160]   during the height of hysteria. So the post was published on March 18th. I
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   talked about the stock market bottom being between 2200 and 2400 and the very
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.400]   next day the market went down to 2300 and then the very next day it did
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.320]   bottom at 2237. Now is that luck or is that skill? I think it's a combination of
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.760]   both. Let's say it's 50% luck and that's fine because that was my framework
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.040]   to put money to work in the stock market and to make myself feel better that the
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.560]   world wasn't coming to an end. So now we're at around 2830 as of April 21st so
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   that's about a 27% rebound so any money you put in below 2400 you know you're up
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.760]   20 to 27% and that's really good money and that's technically a bull market. So
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.720]   let's dig deeper into why the Doomer Bears got the market direction wrong. Why
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.360]   we didn't fall off the cliff and why we have rebounded so ferociously since the
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.040]   bottom. Now I think there's four main parts. The first is the Bears
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.280]   underestimated the power of the Fed. There's an old saying "don't fight the Fed"
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.760]   and in this case you definitely did not want to fight the Fed because they did
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.840]   so much to prop up the markets and maybe the economy. So for example March 3rd
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   they had an emergency 50 bps rate cut and then on March 15th another rate cut
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   by one percentage point down to 0% and then on March 17 there was a slew of
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.080]   measures aimed at keeping credit flowing through the financial system. The Fed
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.120]   said it would start buying commercial paper or the short-term unsecured debt
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   that businesses rely on for operational cash. On the 18th there was another
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.640]   facility providing credit to keep money markets functioning properly. On the 19th
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.240]   there's a new operation focused on currency swaps. On the 20th the operation
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.760]   headed by the Boston Fed announced they were buying municipal debt which was
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   huge because muni bonds were just getting crushed just like the stock
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.880]   market which was a big big surprise for me at least. What else? On March 23rd
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.520]   there was an expansion of the Fed's original announced asset purchases which
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.640]   were supposed to max out at 700 billion. They expanded that and now it's
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.280]   basically unlimited. On March 23rd there's additional next leg of
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.360]   quantitative easing. The Fed also announced a 300 billion credit program
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.800]   for businesses and consumers. On April 6th they announced they'll provide
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.160]   support to the Treasury's payment protection program and on April 9th
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.640]   talked about supporting the 2.3 trillion lending program that will
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.000]   extend credit to banks that issue PPP loans. So the Fed was all in and then the
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   federal government was also all in. Think about all the programs that we are
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.600]   receiving right now. We've got $600 extra in unemployment benefits. We've got
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   stimulus checks of up to $1,200 per person and $500 per child for those who
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.560]   make under $75,000 each or $150,000 total for a household. And then we've got the
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.000]   paycheck protection program which I've said is amazing if you can get it
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.400]   because it covers two and a half times monthly payroll and 75% of the funds can
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.120]   be used for salary and the other 25% for rent, retirement benefits and so forth. So
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.240]   the true amount by the way for how much you can get per employee, the maximum
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.040]   amount for under the PPP program is about $27,000 per employee if you're
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.600]   paying them $100,000 and if you're giving them good retirement benefits and so
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.360]   forth. So a lot of people were confused too. They only thought it was based off
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.580]   $100,000 salary or $8,333 a month times two and a half and that is wrong. You can
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:33.720]   get that plus the bump. Now let's compare the stimulus program of 2020 to 2008 and
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.560]   2009 and I was working on the trading desk and I remember things very clearly
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   and the biggest gripe was that all this stimulus money and bailout money all
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.080]   went to the banks and to other big corporations and none of it really got
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.240]   to the hands of the people. Now there was the 99-week unemployment benefits and
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.400]   that was amazing for those who were able to take you know take advantage and just
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.040]   change things up but there wasn't this huge $600 extra a week and there wasn't
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.960]   this direct PPP loan that basically supports over 1.6 million small
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.400]   businesses which account for 99% of all businesses which employ about half the
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   working population. So of course everything is kind of slow going in
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.840]   terms of the money funding these businesses but it's coming folks. I know
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.040]   more and more people were telling me every single day they got the PPP loan
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.360]   and more money is on the way. So with so much financial support by the government
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.640]   it sure feels like we can last for two months of a quarantine, a lockdown or
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.400]   whatever you want to call it before the economy slowly starts opening up. If you
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.160]   look at my post on the states with the best unemployment benefits you know
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.320]   there's some states now that are paying over $5,000 a month per person thanks to
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   the CARES Act, additional $600 of unemployment a week. $5,000 a month per
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.660]   person is enough I would think to provide for a regularly decent
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.980]   comfortable lifestyle to pay your rent, food and whatnot and if you have two
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.360]   people unemployed you get double the amount and so forth. Now the unemployment
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.440]   benefits run out July 31st 2020, that enhanced benefit of $600 a week but who
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.560]   knows it might be extended and the base case unemployment gets extended to
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.680]   December 31st 2020. So that's pretty good. Alright the second area where the
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.840]   Doomer Bears got wrong was basically overestimating the deadliness of the
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.040]   virus. Look before the pandemic hit I think most of us were like well it's not
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   that bad but then obviously once it started hitting, a lockdown started
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.160]   occurring in mid-march, people got more serious and then you heard politicians
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.240]   say you know maybe a million people could die in America and then they
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.200]   ratcheted down to a hundred thousand to two hundred forty thousand. So these are
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.320]   pretty scary numbers and if you are bearish you're gonna take those to heart
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.640]   and say wow if that many people die you know the economy is really gonna get
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.800]   frozen and really gonna get crushed so you better sell sell sell. Well
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.160]   instead of a hundred thousand to a million people dying so far it's about
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   43,000 and that's terrible but everything is relative and it's not as
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.520]   bad as what our politicians modeled. Here in California our governor Newsom said
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:41.240]   that 25 and a half million Californians would get the coronavirus by mid-may and
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:49.000]   supposedly as of April 20th there's only about 29,000 reported. So is it because
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   of the lockdowns in effect? Definitely for sure but I am sure and everybody
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.480]   else is sure and at least from the investors point of view that that 25 and
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.720]   a half million was a supreme overestimation. I think this situation
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.100]   should really make us realize how much we should not, should not depend on the
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:18.120]   government for everything. Their models were way off, they were late to act, the
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   communication was kind of fuzzy. Look they're trying their best I guess but
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.180]   their best isn't good enough. So if their best is not good enough it's up to us to
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.080]   really think things through to prepare more than the government can tell us to
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   prepare. I mean the US Surgeon General tweeted out and announced that we
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.880]   shouldn't wear masks. Masks are ineffective, they will get us sick more.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.520]   This is around a month and a half ago and it's just absurd given all the other
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.160]   countries who got the coronavirus first were using masks and it sure seemed like
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.200]   it helped flatten the curve and hey a mask protects the other person and it
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   protects yourself. I didn't get that and I think the American public is waking up
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.600]   and realizing you know what that's just crazy too and so now obviously the
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.280]   politicians and the Surgeon General is reversing their recommendation and
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   recommending everyone wear masks. It's just such simple logic that you
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   really got to take whatever the government says with a grain of salt and
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.000]   think for yourself. So you can't really blame the doom and bears too much
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.640]   because they were probably listening to the government, listening to the numbers,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.680]   excrapolating the numbers and believing the government and what they were saying
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   and you know what as a result they missed out or they lost money because
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.480]   they shorted the market and imagine just imagine selling when the S&P 500 was down
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.640]   32% and then shorting and then seeing the market rally another 30 plus percent. I
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.960]   mean you're losing on the way down and you're losing on the way up. That is an
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.880]   absolute disaster folks. Alright the third reason why the doom and bears got
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   the market wrong is fear and hysteria. It really feeds on itself if you're always
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.800]   glued to the news and to social media. The bears have been waiting since the
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.840]   end of 2018 to say the world is coming to an end and the super bears have been
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.680]   waiting since 2008-2009 to pounce and say look everything is gonna come
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.440]   crashing down. So this was their time to scream the loudest and they screamed and
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.400]   screamed and screamed and if you were stuck to the TV or to Twitter you were
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.080]   just getting a face full of their bearishness every single day. Now I
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.320]   understand the need and the desire to shout fire, run away, be careful, the world
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.680]   is coming to an end if you've been bearish for that long and you've missed
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.400]   out. Missing out, the fear of missing out is one of the most powerful emotions
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.120]   many many people felt during the bull run. So when the markets start correcting
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.400]   it's just natural you just want vindication. It's just human nature and
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.120]   so it just gets really dangerous because the fear and the hysteria and the doom
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.600]   just feeds on itself. It just grows like a like a fireball that just becomes
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.480]   massive and you just can't get out of its way and at the end of the day you
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   might be so scared that you're just forced to sell and to believe how bad
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.520]   things really really are. I mean I've got to say despite the unemployment figures,
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   despite the violence of the correction, it still does not feel as bad as what
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.440]   went on in 2008 and 2009 because 2008 and 2009 was a financial crisis due to
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.720]   over leverage. I mean you had to unwind those positions and it took a long time
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.160]   and once you foreclosed on a property or you know you went bankrupt, your credit
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.840]   was screwed for six seven years and just things took forever to unwind. Whereas in
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:13.320]   2020 this is largely a self-inflicted recession. We did this to ourselves which
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.640]   means we have a better chance of undoing the pain once the curve flattens. So
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.840]   logically there should be a quicker rebound in the third quarter if you can
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.080]   get through two to three months of pain. Now let's be honest the v-shaped recovery,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.600]   the right side of the V is probably not going to match the left side of the V.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:39.000]   However it's going to rebound. It's going to rebound as the economy opens and with
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.080]   the Fed and the government really supporting us, it just makes logical
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.440]   sense that things will recover quicker this time around than back during the
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.000]   last financial crisis. But the doomers are saying look this is this is like the
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   financial crisis plus the dot-com bubble plus every single other historical
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.160]   recession all into one. This is what we're experiencing now. Yeah we could be
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.800]   experiencing it for a couple months but don't expect things to be like that for
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.720]   years like it was during the last financial crisis. We all know that misery
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.000]   and fear loves company. So when that is all you see and all you read every
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   single day, it's just going to grow and grow and grow. Just imagine if you just
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.600]   turned off the TV, turned off your computer and your phone for three weeks
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.080]   you definitely would not have been as afraid and as bearish. I don't think so
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.760]   because every time I shut off my devices I feel great. I feel great just spending
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.920]   time with my family and doing something healthy like going for a walk or a hike
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.480]   or whatnot. Alright the fourth and final reason why the Doomer Bears got the
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.800]   direction wrong is because I think they fail to see the benefits of this crisis.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.720]   There's always a silver lining, there's always a positive angle. For example
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.840]   given the lockdowns the overall number of deaths is down. That's pretty good
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:09.280]   right? I'll take it. What else? Less pollution. That's pretty good. What else?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.000]   Improved efficiencies at work. Because we're all locked down we've got to make
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.160]   do with what we have and I think companies are realizing they don't need
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.640]   as many employees to produce the same amount of output. You don't need to have
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.920]   hour-long meetings, you don't need to drive two hours to see a client for an
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.080]   hour, you don't need to get on a plane for three to five hours to see a client
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.840]   and try to develop a relationship. Things can happen over telecommuting,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.520]   teleconferencing and so forth. The other thing is maybe less employees means
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.160]   higher profitability for the company. The companies will make the existing
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.640]   employees who are all still afraid of losing their jobs to work harder and
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.320]   when the rebound comes they're gonna work harder and do the work of one and
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.760]   a half to two employees and we've always seen this during recovery phases of a
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   bear market. I did double the work, maybe triple the work for six months to a year
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.440]   and so did many of my other colleagues back in 2010 and 2011. So output
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.840]   productivity goes up with less people, that's good for earnings, good for
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.640]   profits, good for stocks. And then competition wise what happens during
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.200]   bear markets is unfortunately the weakest companies, the least capitalized
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:32.480]   companies go out of business first and when that happens competition goes down
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.600]   for the survivors and then it's a kind of winner-take-all mentality here. So
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.200]   just look at Amazon. Amazon is going to be around forever and they keep on
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.720]   winning. They just keep on winning right? You just can't bet against Amazon. It's a
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:54.760]   perfect example as bookstores and old mom-and-pop retail stores, all these guys
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.040]   with rent and high overhead costs go out of business, Amazon is going to continue
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.080]   to gain more and more market share. It's sad but it's the reality and as an
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.120]   investor you've got to understand the reality of business. So that's all I can
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.320]   think of folks. Now the question we should all have on our minds is what's
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.800]   next? I think we can agree that there is not going to be the perfect V, the
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.400]   perfect shape to V-shaped recovery. It's going to be more like a swoosh shape
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.560]   right? Things are going to open up, the economy is going to open up slowly
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:32.200]   hopefully in May and then more in June and then even more so in July. There's
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.560]   going to be a lot of changes to the way we interact and do business. There's
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.880]   definitely going to be winners and there's definitely going to be permanent
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.200]   losers, maybe not permanent but losers for another one or two years such as big
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.680]   event companies. And we've got to keep on our toes and pay attention to the
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.120]   markets and try to understand what it's discounting because the markets are
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.520]   always discounting three, six months, a year ahead and it's really hard to
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.640]   think about what life is going to be like in six months but I think in three
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.200]   months we can all agree that by let's say July things are going to be much
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   better than they are right now. There is going to be recovery. So my perspective
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:20.000]   is that if the S&P 500 gets back to 3,000 I'm going to sell 100% of all the
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.520]   stock, the new stock that I bought in the first quarter of 2020. I want to get back
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.280]   down to my original weighting of 20% of my net worth in equities. And that's just
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.320]   me folks because I don't believe we're going to get to all-time highs so
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.520]   quickly. I think we're eventually going to get there maybe, I don't know, next year, two
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.800]   years but if we can get all the way back to 3,000 that is a massive 30-35%
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.480]   ramp. I plan to take that win and then just ride whatever I had exposed going
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.160]   forward and if the market goes back down to 2,400 or below I'm going to be buying
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.480]   again. And if you are suddenly deliriously bullish for some reason I
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   need you to look back to the time period of March 18th to March 20th and think
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.360]   about where things were then. Be careful. Nothing goes down in a straight line and
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.880]   nothing goes up in a straight line. This is as close as it's gotten in the
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.760]   history of the stock market but you're going to expect more false starts, more
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.280]   volatility and so forth. The key is to protect your capital and make sure
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:38.560]   you're okay with your risk exposure. Once again for me my main goal is capital
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   preservation. If I can make single-digit returns on my net worth each year I'm
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.680]   fine. You got to decide what's good for you and only you can decide. Alright
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.480]   thanks so much everyone. Nobody has a crystal ball I don't think but if you
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.840]   got one let me know what your thoughts are, what you're doing and how you plan
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.320]   to position yourself going forward. Best of luck and stay safe.
