[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   - Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.760]   Ethan, a podcast listener in the Middle East,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.200]   sends us this email to ask,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.040]   "Pastor John, does the Bible say or imply
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680]   "that part of the message of the cross
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.600]   "is our inherent value?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880]   "In other words, does the price paid to redeem us
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.180]   "mean that we were worth it?
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.240]   "And if the cross tells believers about our value,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.340]   "what about those for whom Christ did not die?
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.880]   "Are they less valuable?"
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.280]   What would you say to Ethan?
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.360]   - This kind of question has been around
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.560]   my entire adult life.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.600]   I've been responding to this question,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.440]   I can remember back at Bethel.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.440]   I've been responding to this question for over 40 years.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.880]   And I've heard people say things like,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.680]   if you want to see how much you are worth,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.560]   look at the price God was willing to pay for you.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   Or sometimes it comes in a little more ambiguous form,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.680]   God don't die for trash.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.480]   Now the response that is needed
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.480]   for each of those kinds of statements is a little different,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.800]   but basically the same.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.000]   The Bible does not portray the cross of Christ
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   as a display of the prior value
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.120]   of what he purchased by it.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.160]   Just the opposite.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.640]   The cross is a display of the hopeless,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   undeserving, dirty, sinful, guilty, rebellious,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.060]   corrupted condition of the people who were purchased.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   The magnitude of Christ's sufferings is a measure,
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.320]   not of the magnitude of my worth,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.640]   but the magnitude of the ugliness of my sin,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.040]   the outrage of my rebellion,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.840]   the infinite value of the glory of God
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   that my sin had defamed.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.520]   Did God die for trash?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.260]   The context of this statement usually signifies
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.220]   a similar misunderstanding of the meaning of the cross,
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.220]   but to respond to it requires more careful nuancing
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.160]   about the nature of man.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.280]   The short answer is that man is not trash,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   but an amazing being in the image of God
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.160]   who has prostituted his dignity to such a degree
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.040]   that he is worse than trash.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.800]   - Wow. - That's the short answer.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   A trashed glory is worse than trash.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.520]   A genius turned murder is worse
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.960]   than an unintelligent person turned murder.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.680]   The prostitution of greatness is morally worse
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.360]   than the wasting of weakness.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.680]   Man was created in the image of God.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.880]   This means that he had a unique potential
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.440]   for conscious, God-glorifying worship.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.160]   This is why he was made.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   This is precisely what he lost in the fall,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.280]   his worshiping soul vanished.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.680]   He may still be able to invent computers
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.140]   and travel to Mars and build skyscrapers,
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.480]   but all of these are prostituted capacities
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.360]   wherever they are not done in reliance upon God
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   and for the glory of God.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.920]   And that prostitution of worshiping potential
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   is worse than if he were only created
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.500]   with trash-like possibilities.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.840]   Before Paul describes the meaning of the cross of Christ,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.940]   he describes the catastrophic corruption
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.600]   of the greatness of man.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.220]   Romans 3, 9, "What then?
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.300]   Are we Jews any better off?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.260]   No, not at all, for we have already charged
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.980]   that both Jews and Greeks are under sin.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.740]   As it is written, none is righteous.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.480]   No, not one.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.620]   No one understands.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.040]   No one seeks for God.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.660]   The ultimate evil of human sin
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.340]   is the belittling of the glory of God
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.820]   by exchanging that glory for lesser things
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.180]   and thus communicating that God is of less value
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.880]   than what he has made."
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.940]   This is what Paul meant in Romans 3, 23,
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.640]   when he said, "All have sinned and fall short of,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.140]   or lack, lack, because we've exchanged it,
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.700]   the glory of God.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   The more you exalt the wonder of human capacities,
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.160]   the more you indict human beings as morally heinous.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.560]   It is precisely the throwing away of our greatest dignity
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   as people with capacities to know and love God
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   that constitutes our lowest evil."
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.520]   It's the throwing away of the greatness
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.760]   that is the lowness of the evil
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.280]   and our loss of all inborn worth
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   that we were created to use for God's glory.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   Therefore, when God sends Jesus to die for us,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.200]   he is most emphatically not coming to pay a price
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   that signals our prior innate value.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.200]   Paul says, "While we were yet weak,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.160]   at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.880]   Scarcely will one die for a righteous person.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.940]   Perhaps one would die for a good person.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.800]   But God shows his love for us
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.520]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   The logic of those verses is inescapably plain.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   Everything about us was undeserving of what God paid for us.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.440]   This is the very meaning of grace.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.740]   And if someone says, "But he didn't die for horses."
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.840]   My response is, "Horses would have been easier to die for."
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.160]   The fact that he chose to die for humans instead of animals
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.200]   is not because we were more deserving,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   but because he meant to create what he had thrown away,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.720]   namely, what we had thrown away, namely, worshiping souls.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.640]   Therefore, it is right to say,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   Christ did not die to respond to innate value.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.560]   He died to create spirit-wrought value.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Ephesians 2:10, "We are his workmanship,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.960]   which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.440]   Oh, oh, there is worth.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.760]   There is value in the new creation
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.800]   with all of its worshiping bent.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.320]   So my answer to Ethan's question is,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   no, the message of the cross is not our innate value.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.920]   No, the price paid does not mean we were worth it.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.160]   No, therefore, the cross does not testify
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.760]   to the superior innate prior value
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.400]   of the redeemed over the non-redeemed.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   Rather, the cross, number one,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   testifies to the infinite value of the glory of God.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.840]   Number two, it testifies to the enormity of human sin
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   in belittling that glory.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.640]   And number three, it testifies to the immeasurable greatness
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.680]   of the grace of God.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.080]   And number four, it testifies to the new creation
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.200]   that God has brought into being,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.640]   which is a beautiful thing.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   Wow, that is a word much needed today as ever, Pastor John.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.040]   Thank you, and thank you for the question, Ethan.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.360]   Please keep those questions coming in.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.800]   We are gonna break for the weekend now,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.620]   but you can keep up with the Daily Ask Pastor John podcast

[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.440]   Well, next week we celebrate Christmas,
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.320]   and leading up to the Friday celebration,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   we have a special week planned.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.560]   And we are gonna talk with a respected historian
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.480]   about one of the most controversial figures
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.240]   of the Christmas story, Herod the Great.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.760]   And we will also talk about the meaning of Christmas,
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.480]   and of course, we will talk about the meaning of Santa.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   It will no doubt be a very interesting week,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.960]   and I'm looking forward to it.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.080]   Have a wonderful weekend, and we will see you on Monday.
