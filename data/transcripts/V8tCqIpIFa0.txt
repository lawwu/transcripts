[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - Happy Monday, as we get back after it here on the podcast.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   Pastor John, I know one of the things
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900]   that you really enjoy is answering questions
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.320]   in front of students, open floor Q&As.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.760]   You've been doing this for over 50 years
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.920]   and still at it, currently investing your time
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.560]   into the lives and students at Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.240]   This time with students is built into your schedule now
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.840]   and recently in that context with BCS students,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.600]   you had a chance to walk through the theological battles
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.660]   that you have fought over the decades.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.000]   And I was wondering, looking back on those battles,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500]   if you could reshare what you said in private
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.360]   with us here on APJ.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120]   Can you rehearse those battles decade by decade?
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680]   And if you could, tell us what points you were trying
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.120]   to make in rehearsing this history with the students.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.960]   - As part of my happy responsibilities
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.720]   as Chancellor of Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   I regularly participate in what we call table talk,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.140]   where the students gather to eat their lunch
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.140]   and ask questions of the leaders, and I'm one of those,
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.800]   related to life, related to ministry,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.500]   how it relates to the issues of our day.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.080]   And I generally begin those sessions with some thoughts
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.800]   off my front burner, just to prime the pump of questions
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.600]   and throw it open to whatever the students
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.880]   want to talk about.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.040]   So a few weeks ago, I tried to make this point
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.980]   in my introductory comments.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.280]   I said something like, "Since the issues
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.620]   that you will be facing," looking at the students,
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.620]   "that you'll be facing in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now,
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.200]   you'll be my age in 50 years.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440]   Since those issues that you'll be facing
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   are utterly unpredictable, and in some cases, unimaginable,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   your best preparation right now in your teens
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   and 20s and 30s is to gain the spiritual
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.480]   and intellectual abilities to interpret God's
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.640]   never-changing word in scripture,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.200]   according to its true God-intended meaning,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400]   which will never leave you speechless."
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240]   Never.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.320]   "But always provide the profoundest wisdom
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   for every new challenge, none of which takes God off guard."
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.800]   So that was my main point to try to get across to them.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.760]   And then to drive the point home,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.600]   I gave them a glimpse into the controversies
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.280]   of the last 50 years of my life.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.120]   - Wow.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   - Precious, the Bible has become as an absolutely sure
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.080]   compass for staying the course of truth and wisdom,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.560]   and as an anchor to keep me from being driven about
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.480]   by every wind of doctrine, and as a treasure chest
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   of holy joy that satisfies so deeply
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.520]   that I'm not sucked in to the seductive pleasures
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.400]   that on the surface change from era to era.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.240]   They don't really change, but the form changes.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   So here's part of the glimpse that I gave them
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   into my 50-year history of dealing with unexpected issues.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.120]   But let me say at the outset that I'm not gonna focus
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.120]   on race and abortion as one of those issues
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   because they're just pervasive.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.240]   I mean, for the last decades of my life,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.960]   I have lived every decade with issues of race
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920]   that need to be addressed, and issues of abortion
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.480]   that need to be addressed.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.960]   So understand those are huge issues,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.840]   and that I don't mention them in the list
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.640]   doesn't mean they're absent, it means they're everywhere.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.520]   - Yeah.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.800]   - So in the 1960s, I was coming to terms
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.520]   with the controversy surrounding fresh historical arguments
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.360]   for the factual resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.040]   Daniel Fuller's "Easter Faith in History"
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   had been published in 1965.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.560]   Wolfhard Pannenberg was making waves
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.800]   by his 1968 book "Revelation as History,"
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   where he argued that the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   was an historical event as real
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.240]   as you're getting out of bed this morning,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   which in German, but money in circles in the '60s
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   was absolutely radical.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.960]   He was one of the teachers I had, by the way,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.360]   at the University of Munich in the '70s.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   Hand in glove with the controversy was the whole issue
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.600]   of the modern methodology of critical biblical scholarship.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.800]   In 1966, George Ladd published "The New Testament
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.440]   and Criticism," where he tried to sort out
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.200]   what was usable in so-called higher criticism
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.640]   and what was contradictory
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.160]   to the inspired nature of scripture.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.720]   And those were crucial days for me,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.320]   crucial, like crux, like crossroads,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   and how I thank God in the ways I could have gone
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.760]   that he held on to me for his glory and for his word.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.280]   Then came the 1970s and three huge issues.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.920]   In 1970, Hal Lindsey published "The Late Great Planet Earth."
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.520]   By 1999, that book had sold 35 million copies.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.560]   - Wow.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.960]   - In it, he virtually predicted the second coming by 1988.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.200]   I don't know how that book stays in print
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.240]   unless they adjusted it.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.120]   And he popularized the pre-tribulational rapture view
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.520]   of the second coming.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.960]   And I wrote a paper in response to this,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.800]   and it became very personal because my father and I
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.720]   locked horns over this,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.080]   and there's nobody I loved more than my father,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.360]   and I didn't want to alienate him.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.960]   And we got along pretty well,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.280]   although that book brought a lot of stuff to the fore.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   1975, Paul Jewett published "Man as Male and Female,"
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.720]   in which he said that when Paul instructed only men
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.000]   to teach and have authority in the church,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.480]   he simply made a mistake.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.960]   Paul just made a mistake. - Wow.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.560]   - And allowed his rabbinical background
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.200]   to silence his radical Christian newness.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.280]   And from then on to this very day,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.720]   I knew that's an issue I'll never be able to get away from
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.640]   because there's more critical things going on there,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   more reasons to be concerned than just one.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   1976, Harold Linzell published "The Battle for the Bible"
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.400]   and brought to public awareness
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.880]   how many Christian institutions were sliding away
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.720]   from commitment to the inerrancy of scripture.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.240]   In 1978, the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.080]   produced "The Chicago Statement on Inerrancy,"
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.040]   and I wrote a review of Linzell's book,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.400]   and I'm very happy with what happened in Chicago,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.600]   and I'm happy to sign on
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.200]   to "The Chicago Statement on Inerrancy."
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.960]   1980s, two controversies stand out.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.800]   Professor of philosophy Thomas Talbot and I
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.320]   went back and forth with articles in "The Reform Journal"
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.680]   over the sovereignty of God in Romans 9.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.240]   I think titles were like, "How Does a Sovereign God Love?"
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.360]   I published a book on Romans 9
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.440]   called "The Justification of God,"
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   which focused on Romans 9, 1 to 23.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   And so the understanding of God's sovereignty in history
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.880]   and in salvation dominated the early 1980s.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.040]   Near the end of the decade,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.480]   the missiological controversy
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.400]   surrounding the new language of unreached people groups
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.520]   and whether that was a biblical way to think or not
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.200]   was a huge issue for me.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.840]   Does the Great Commission focus on reaching
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.720]   as many individuals as possible,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.560]   which is what I had thought,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   or on reaching all the ethno-linguistic groups in the world?
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.520]   Then much of the 1990s was dominated by open theism.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.440]   Does God have an exhaustive foreknowledge of the future?
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.320]   Open theism said, "No, he doesn't."
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   And its chief spokesman was and is right here
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.480]   in the Twin Cities as a pastor.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.920]   And so he and I debated back and forth.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   We had lunch together and I wrote much
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.480]   and other people wrote very good books.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.160]   And thankfully, I think open theism
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.240]   was basically marginalized, though it hasn't gone away.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   In the 2000s, the Emergent Church flourished for a season
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.600]   and then morphed into other things.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.960]   I don't think it's entirely gone away,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.880]   but it's not the movement it was.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.680]   And I took two of those leaders out to lunch one time,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.720]   just to give our folks a flavor
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.200]   of what we're talking about with the Emergent Church.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.320]   And I said to them, "You know, talking to you guys
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.440]   is like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall."
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.480]   To which they responded, "That's not what Jell-O's for."
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.680]   (laughing)
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.880]   That really gives a good flavor
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.880]   of how doctrinally amorphous that movement was.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   In the 2010s, the doctrine of justification
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.240]   was very controverted and prominent.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.480]   And I wrote a whole book, "The Future of Justification,
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   Responding to N.T. Wright."
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.520]   And on the same front, friends of mine were involved
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.920]   relationally in some very difficult conversations
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   called Evangelicals and Catholics Together,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.280]   which broke some hearts over how good Reform Brothers
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.800]   didn't relate to Catholics in the same way.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.880]   Which brings us then, swirling into the last decade
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.120]   with the splintering of evangelicalism because of Trump,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.360]   the realities of so-called same-sex marriage,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.400]   the realities of so-called gender transition,
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.120]   vaccination mandates, critical race theory,
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.760]   systemic racism, cancel culture.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.600]   None of these things can be ignored by a pastor,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   I think indeed by a thoughtful lay person.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.600]   And I've written on virtually all of them.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   But the point for that table talk,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.920]   and maybe for this moment in "Ask Pastor John,"
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.680]   is if you live long enough, you will be confronted
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.720]   by issues and controversies that are so many and so diverse
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.280]   and sometimes so complex that you cannot possibly predict
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.880]   or specifically prepare for them.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   The best way for our students and our listeners to APJ
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.720]   to prepare for faithful, obedient, fruitful ministry
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.120]   in the next 50 years is to know your Bible deeply,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.040]   thoroughly, confidently, joyfully.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.920]   Other studies are important, absolutely important.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.800]   This study of the Bible is essential.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.400]   If you have gone deep with God by means of a rigorous
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   and accurate understanding of his word,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.760]   you'll always be relevant and you will never be speechless.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.600]   The breadth of theological controversies
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   over the past 50 years makes my head spin.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that rundown.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.000]   And I really can't hear this episode
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.680]   without thinking of your own theological development,
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.680]   Pastor John, and how you arrived at your convictions
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.400]   that you're at now about knowing the Bible deeply.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.800]   And it comes from a precious text in Psalm 119.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.840]   Psalm 119, verses 97 to 100.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.320]   That text played a huge role
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.600]   in your own theological development
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.080]   while you were in Germany.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.880]   Specifically, we talked about that season in APJ 1713
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.480]   in an episode titled "John Piper's Ministry
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.160]   in One Bible Text," looking at that one text.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.400]   Psalm 119, verses 97 to 100.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.080]   Really an essential APJ episode that you can find right now
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.960]   at askpastorjohn.com, APJ 1713.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.160]   Well, God is happy in himself, amen,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.200]   and God wants us to be happy in himself, amen.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.640]   And when you begin to apply biblical categories here,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.800]   you begin to ask the question,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.000]   how does God's joy become my joy?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.160]   That's our question next time.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.280]   From a listener in Chicago, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.880]   See you Thursday.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.880]   You
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   You
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   You
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
