[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   - What are the most beautiful or fascinating aspects
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.760]   of language or ideas in linguistics or cognitive science
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.080]   that you've seen in a lifetime of studying language
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.200]   and studying the human mind?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   - Well, I think the deepest property of language
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.920]   and puzzling property that's been discovered
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.280]   is what is sometimes called structure dependence.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.640]   We now understand it pretty well,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.960]   but it was puzzling for a long time.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640]   I'll give you a concrete example.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.680]   So suppose you say,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.880]   the guy who fixed the car carefully packed his tools.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.120]   It's ambiguous.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.960]   He could fix the car carefully or carefully pack his tools.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.080]   Suppose you put carefully in front,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.880]   carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400]   Then it's carefully packed, not carefully fixed.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.320]   And in fact, you do that even if it makes no sense.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640]   So suppose you say carefully,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.160]   the guy who fixed the car is tall.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.880]   You have to interpret it as carefully he's tall,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280]   even though that doesn't make any sense.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.200]   And notice that that's a very puzzling fact
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.080]   because you're relating carefully,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.640]   not to the linearly closest verb,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.320]   but to the linearly more remote verb.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320]   A linear closeness is a easy computation,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.760]   but here you're doing a much more,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.800]   what looks like a more complex computation.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520]   You're doing something that's taking you
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.920]   essentially to the more remote thing.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.680]   It's now, if you look at the actual structure
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.200]   of the sentence, where the phrases are and so on,
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.240]   turns out you're picking out the structurally closest thing,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.000]   but the linearly more remote thing.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   But notice that what's linear is 100% of what you hear.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.200]   You never hear structure, can't.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960]   So what you're doing is, and incidentally,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.200]   this is universal, all constructions, all languages.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.580]   And what we're compelled to do is carry out
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.720]   what looks like the more complex computation
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.280]   on material that we never hear,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   and we ignore 100% of what we hear
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.560]   and the simplest computation.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.720]   But by now there's even a neural basis for this
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.920]   that's somewhat understood.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.440]   And there's good theories by now
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.660]   that explain why it's true.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.040]   That's a deep insight into the surprising nature
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   of language with many consequences.
