[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Well, should the local church work alongside
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.880]   the college campus outreach,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   or are these two in competition with one another?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.760]   A listener writes in to ask.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.860]   Dear Pastor John, my name is Ryan,
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.320]   a senior at Virginia Tech.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.480]   I've been struggling lately with the appropriate role
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.680]   of campus ministry as it relates to the local church.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.560]   What should that relationship look like?
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.080]   Should campus ministries focus mostly on evangelism
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.920]   and the church on discipleship?
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.360]   What roles should each take to best further the gospel?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   - So Ryan asks, what should that relationship look like,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.120]   local church and campus ministry?
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.380]   But then he refines the question,
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.040]   should campus ministries focus mostly on evangelism
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.120]   and the church on discipleship?
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.760]   But with that refinement of the question,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.800]   he might be assuming something that in the best case
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.880]   should not be assumed, shouldn't exist.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.760]   So I'm gonna go with his first question
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.660]   rather than the refinement, and maybe it'll be plain why,
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.720]   namely, what should that relationship look like?
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.280]   I'm not on a crusade here
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.940]   against para-church campus ministries.
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.600]   I think they have done great good
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.980]   for hundreds of thousands of students
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.360]   and that many churches have benefited greatly
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.300]   from the ripple effect of those evangelistic
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.680]   and discipling efforts.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.560]   Nevertheless, I think that the relationship
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.080]   between the local church and the campus ministries
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.720]   should be different than it often is.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.440]   What I have in mind is what we did at Bethlehem
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   while I was pastor there, and it still exists,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.000]   and I watch it with great joy,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080]   namely, we asked a ministry called Campus Outreach
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.840]   to come to our church about 13, 14 years ago.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.500]   Campus Outreach is a loose affiliation
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.200]   of campus ministries with a common Reformed theology
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.720]   and a common ethos and philosophy of ministry
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.840]   that are not responsible
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.520]   to any central campus ministry organization.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.720]   There's no formal structure with leadership at the top
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.520]   dictating what the campus ministry should do,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360]   but in each town or city where the campuses are,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.480]   Campus Outreach is responsible to,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   and usually part of, the leadership of a local church,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.840]   like ours.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.520]   In other words, the campus ministry only exists
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.580]   on the campuses as an extension of the ministry
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.540]   of a particular local church.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.960]   In this kind of arrangement, it seems to me,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.400]   the ministry enjoys the best of both worlds.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.120]   On the one hand, it honors the New Testament focus
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   on the local church as God's design
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160]   for reaching and discipling the lost,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   and on the other hand, it benefits from the special focus
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.880]   and training and strategy and funding
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.800]   that is explicitly targeting the special challenges
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.220]   of young people at the university.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.040]   In this relationship, the tension doesn't exist
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280]   over the question, should the campus ministry
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.160]   do the discipling work,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.540]   and hope that someday students might find their way
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.320]   to a local church, because the campus ministry
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   and its discipling work are part of the local church,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.300]   and students are drawn into relationships
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.100]   and church involvement all at the same time.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.540]   That's the vision, that's the whole point,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.860]   structure, philosophy of ministry.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.400]   What makes this possible is that the campus ministry
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.200]   is philosophically, theologically, ethically,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   on the same page as the leadership of the local church.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.440]   So there's no awkwardness or inconsistency
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.520]   in inviting people to Christ,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.640]   and at the same time, inviting them into the fellowship
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.600]   of Christ's people at the local church,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.800]   which is the way evangelism should be happening.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.720]   I think one of the reasons there's often a tension
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.680]   between campus ministry and local church
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.560]   is that the campus ministries didn't grow out
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.280]   of the local churches, and therefore feel awkward
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.480]   in bringing new converts to a local church,
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.400]   because there's no organic relationship
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.040]   between the church and the campus ministry,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.260]   so it feels like a kind of a add-on,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.320]   an unusual advocacy for a particular local church
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.160]   when all of them are around.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.600]   The relationship feels peripheral and optional
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   and strained sometimes, and I think that's very sad
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.680]   and doesn't serve God's purposes in the world as well
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   as if the campus ministry were such a clear
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880]   and organic extension of the local church
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.640]   that when students come to Christ,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.520]   being part of the campus ministry
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.020]   would mean being part of the local church,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.240]   being part of God's worshiping people
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.160]   of all the ages and ethnicities and so on.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.800]   It ought to feel seamless
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.000]   between evangelism, discipleship, church.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   I think what this means, very practically,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.300]   so let's just be practical for him where he is on his campus.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.080]   I think what this means for those who serve
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.480]   in campus ministries that are not structured
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.040]   like campus outreach is that I just described,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.360]   the implication is that the campus minister
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   should seek to find the most biblical
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   and faithful church they can find in that area,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   be a full-fledged member there,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.240]   and then teach the new converts
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.280]   through the campus ministry, teach the new converts
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.520]   from the beginning that being part
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.800]   of a local church is part of what it means
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.080]   to be a Christian, and then draw them
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.900]   in to their own participation in the church.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.020]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John,
