[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.120]   - Happy New Year's everyone.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.840]   On this final day of 2021,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   we end our ninth full year of podcasting
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.640]   and we end it talking about holiness
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.360]   and the pursuit of perfection.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.800]   Here's the email.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.680]   Pastor John, hello, my name is Christopher
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.840]   and I live in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.560]   I've been listening to APJ for a little over a year now.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.720]   First, thank you so much
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.680]   for the incredible wealth of knowledge you've given to me
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.440]   and to all your listeners through this podcast
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.840]   over the years.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240]   I've heard you on many occasions mention
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.260]   the danger of perfectionism as a Christian.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.120]   I am guilty of this.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.540]   After thinking a great deal about sanctification
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.480]   and listening to APJ 1663 about pursuing holiness,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   it only gets worse.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.320]   I recognize that we are not justified by works,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.980]   but also that the pursuit to live holy lives
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.600]   is the evidence that we are saved.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.360]   I feel like this makes it very hard for me
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960]   to come to terms with my own failure
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.400]   and instead of running back to Christ when I sin,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.360]   I spiral down into thoughts like,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   well, maybe I was never truly saved.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.160]   It's almost as though I condemn myself into depression,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.640]   even though Christ brings no condemnation
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.540]   and it often takes days to work through it.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.220]   How do I find the balance between pursuing holiness
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.160]   and moving past my failure to be holy?
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160]   Is pursuing holiness the same as pursuing perfection?
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.920]   Well, that last couple of sentences
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.640]   really is two questions, isn't it?
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   He says, how do I find the balance
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.840]   between pursuing holiness and moving past my failure
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.640]   to be holy, that's one.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.880]   And then the last one was, is pursuing holiness
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.440]   the same as pursuing perfection?
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.800]   So let me answer both of those as best I can
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   and start with the second one first.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   Is pursuing holiness the same as pursuing perfection?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.400]   It's an ambiguous question
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.840]   because it switches categories on me
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   from a quality holiness to a quantity perfect holiness.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480]   You can see the ambiguity if you ask the question like this,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.160]   rephrase it like this.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.500]   Is pursuing partial holiness
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.560]   the same as pursuing complete holiness?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.040]   And the answer is, well, there is a difference
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.000]   between partial and complete.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.160]   So when it comes to holiness, the question becomes,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.880]   which are you pursuing, partial holiness
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.560]   or complete holiness?
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   And what makes that question psychologically complicated
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   is that the New Testament teaches that in this life,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480]   Christians will not attain sinless perfection.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.640]   And yet we are commanded to be perfect
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.340]   as our Father in heaven is perfect.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640]   Not perfect just by human standards,
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.680]   perfect by divine standards, God's standards.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.300]   So Matthew 5:48, you shall be perfect
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.800]   as your heavenly Father is perfect,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.860]   which I think is just another way of saying,
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.720]   you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.000]   and with all your soul and with all your mind.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.760]   That's Matthew 22, 37, the great commandment.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.960]   Or what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 7, 1,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.880]   let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   and spirit, bringing holiness to completion
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.600]   in the fear of God.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.840]   Or what James says in James 1, 4,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.720]   let steadfastness have its full effect,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.520]   that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.660]   And yet, in spite of these repeated commands
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.240]   to pursue perfection, we are taught in the Bible
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.000]   that our victory over the power of sin will be incomplete
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   until we're in the presence of Christ.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.600]   For example, James 3, verse two,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.000]   we all stumble in many ways.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.840]   And if anyone does not stumble in what he says,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.520]   he's a perfect man able to bridle his own body,
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.560]   including the tongue.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.000]   And then he says in verse eight, nobody can tame the tongue.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Or Philippians 3, 12, not that I have already obtained
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.960]   the resurrection or am already perfect,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.080]   but I press on to make it my own
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.340]   because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.600]   Paul never claimed, he explicitly said,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.320]   I haven't attained perfection yet.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   Or the Lord's Prayer, we're told right after we're told
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   to pray every day for our daily bread,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   we're to pray, forgive us our sins or our debts
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.960]   as we have forgiven our debtors.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.800]   Now that's not a command to pray one time
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.000]   at the beginning of your Christian life
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   that your debts be forgiven.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.980]   That is the same kind of prayer as give us this day,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.800]   our daily bread.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   He's talking to disciples.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.920]   This is a command to avail ourselves
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   of regular repeated forgiveness.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   So on the one hand, we have the command
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.200]   to be perfect, repeated.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.260]   And on the other hand, we have the teaching
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.680]   that we will not in this life be perfect.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.920]   So back to our question, what should we pursue?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.100]   Is it even meaningful to say
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   that we are pursuing perfection?
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.180]   Would it be like an athlete saying,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.180]   I am pursuing a high jump record of 20 feet, that's my goal,
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.900]   or a long jump record of 100 feet,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.940]   or a one mile running time of one minute?
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.420]   Now, none of those are ever going to happen
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.940]   while human beings are the kind of human beings
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.940]   they are now.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.840]   - Yeah.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.340]   - But as long as God is God,
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.400]   his standard cannot be less than perfection.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.900]   And when he calls us to perfection, he is not naive.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.700]   He knows that in this life we will fall short,
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.180]   but he also knows that he intends to give us success
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.180]   in the pursuit of perfection when we see him face to face.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.500]   The quest is not in vain.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.340]   We will attain perfection.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.340]   And the pursuit of holiness now is essential
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.780]   to attain the final perfecting work of God.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.460]   So it's never wrong, it's never wrong
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.460]   to say we are pursuing perfection in that sense.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.220]   As we pursue holiness here,
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.100]   we are pursuing the perfection that God will grant us
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   through the pursuit of holiness someday.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.880]   But in the pursuit of perfection,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.220]   which we will only attain in the presence of God,
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.680]   there is this brief period of time on earth
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.580]   when our pursuit is so embattled,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.380]   indwelling sin is so strong,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.540]   satanic opposition is so great
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.540]   that even though counted righteous in Christ by faith,
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.180]   we are not yet completely righteous in our conduct
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.020]   and will not be completely righteous in our conduct
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.420]   till we see Christ face to face.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.700]   So perhaps we should say it like this.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.380]   In our pursuit of perfect holiness
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.920]   in the presence of Christ,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   let us seek now to be as holy as a justified sinner can be.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.140]   And we don't know what the limits are
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.860]   on that imperfect holiness.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.860]   And there are always more victories to be attained.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.940]   Now, back to Christopher's other question.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.940]   How do I find the balance between pursuing holiness
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.080]   that way, I hope,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   and moving past my failure to be holy?
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.240]   How do we not let our failures to be holy
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.160]   as we ought to be, indeed, as we could be,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.880]   we all fall short not only of what we ought to be,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.540]   but could be,
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.360]   how do we not let those failures depress us
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.420]   and so discourage us that we are paralyzed
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.160]   with hopelessness in the pursuit of holiness,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.680]   especially when we realize that our lives must bear witness
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.560]   that we truly are born again
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.220]   and have saving faith and are justified?
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.440]   We know that we're not justified by works,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   but we also know that our works confirm our justification.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:20.720]   So how do we enjoy the assurance of our salvation
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   when our holiness remains imperfect?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.840]   Let me just point to one passage of Scripture
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.960]   that is so important,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.280]   and I pray that we will all linger over it long enough
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.040]   to let it have its good assurance-giving effect.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.920]   Here's 1 John 6-9.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.980]   If we say we have fellowship with God
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.600]   while we walk in darkness,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.160]   we lie and do not practice the truth.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.880]   So, in other words, how we walk testifies
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.240]   to whether we really have a relationship with God.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.160]   He goes on.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.100]   But if we walk in the light as he is in the light,
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   we have fellowship with one another,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.900]   and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.900]   So he's saying walking in the light is essential
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.980]   to show that we are being cleansed from our sins
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.080]   by the blood of Jesus.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.120]   Now, verse 8.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.440]   and the truth is not in us.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   So he says walking in the light cannot mean sinlessness.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.920]   Let that sink in.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   Walking in the light cannot mean sinlessness
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.540]   because he just said, "You gotta walk in the light,"
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.640]   and he just said, "If you say you're sinless,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.900]   "you're dead wrong."
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.800]   Well, what then does walking in the light mean?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.240]   So he goes on, one more verse.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   Verse 9.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.280]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.240]   to forgive us our sins and cleanse us
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.880]   from all unrighteousness.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.760]   So here is John's description of the imperfect Christian.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.080]   He does not claim perfection,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.880]   but he does claim to walk in the light
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.140]   because if you don't walk in the light,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.760]   you don't have fellowship with God,
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.160]   and the blood of Jesus doesn't cleanse you from sin.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.880]   It doesn't cover your sin.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.680]   Well, what then does walk in the light mean
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.600]   if it doesn't mean sinlessness?
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   And his answer is it means a pattern of obedience
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   that involves regular, sincere confession of sin.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.720]   The person who walks in the light has enough light
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.400]   to see sin for what it is and to hate it and confess it
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.280]   and to receive forgiveness for it with thankfulness
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.960]   and humility and to press on with fresh resolve
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.040]   to love God and people better.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think that's the apostle's answer to Christopher's
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.380]   question, and now we need to pray.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.380]   We need to pray that God would work this miracle
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.640]   of this biblical pattern into our lives.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.800]   Yeah, amen.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.040]   It's one thing to talk about holiness.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.800]   It's another thing to actually live it out.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.760]   Well, this being New Year's Eve,
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.280]   our year-end fundraising campaign ends tonight.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   If you'd like to become a monthly ministry partner with us,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.320]   today is a great day to join.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.120]   You can set up monthly giving online
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.520]   at give.desiringgod.org.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.840]   That's a web address, give.desiringgod.org.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.700]   We're back next year on Monday.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.700]   We begin 2022 with a great question, what are idols?
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.400]   Both the little carved trinkets that we read about
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.080]   in the Old Testament, and what are the heart idols
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.920]   that we read about in the New Testament?
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.960]   And how are these two different idols linked?
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.800]   Are they?
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.080]   It's a great question to inaugurate our 10th year
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.800]   of this podcast.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.000]   10 years, amazing.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.680]   Thanks for being a part of our podcast over these years.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   Have a great New Year's Eve.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.760]   Have a great New Year's Day.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   And Pastor John and I will see you next year.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.600]   Take care.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
