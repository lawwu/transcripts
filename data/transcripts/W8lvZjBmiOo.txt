[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.320]   My name is Rick Ferry and I'm the president
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.060]   of the John C. Vogel Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.620]   We are a non-profit organization, a 501(c)(3) organization.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.060]   You can go to vogelcenter.net.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.420]   That means your tax-deductible contributions
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.060]   are greatly appreciated.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.540]   And today we feature Bob Pisani
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.980]   as CNBC's Senior Markets Correspondent
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.980]   who has covered Wall Street for 25 years.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.500]   Today he'll be interviewing Dr. Bill Bernstein
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.380]   about his new book, "The Delusions of Crowds."
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.740]   And if you missed this or can't watch the whole thing,
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.780]   we are recording it and it will be available
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.780]   on vogelheads.org as well as the Vogel Center site,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.660]   vogelcenter.net within a few days.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.060]   So with no further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Bob.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.740]   - I can't tell you how honored I am to be here.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.740]   I am a Markets Correspondent, as you heard.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.500]   I've been with CNBC for 31 years.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.380]   I've been the Markets Correspondent since 1997.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.980]   I met Jack Vogel in 1997 at that time
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.540]   and had a phone conversation with him
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540]   and was profoundly influenced by him so much.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.220]   So I opened a Vanguard account for my wife
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.220]   in that year in 1997.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.220]   I'm a Vogelhead in certainly maybe not officially a member,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.860]   I'd like to be, but I have been for 24 or 25 years.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.660]   So it's a great honor and I'm a big fan of Rick Ferry
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.980]   and William Bernstein.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.380]   We're gonna try to keep to the time here.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.180]   It's a Saturday afternoon, it's beautiful.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.380]   Spend a lot of your time.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.780]   We're gonna try to keep it to one hour.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.020]   Bill Bernstein, when I, I've known Jim for many years,
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.940]   when Jim took this over and said,
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.380]   "I'm gonna do something with the Vogelheads."
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.460]   I said, "I want in on this."
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580]   And he said, "Well, Bill Bernstein's doing it."
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.940]   And I said, "I've known Bill Bernstein's work for years."
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.900]   "The Birth of Plenty" is one of my favorite
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.620]   economics history books.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.780]   And I read the new one, "The Delusion of Crowds"
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.020]   and "Why People Go Mad in Groups."
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.660]   And that's what we wanna at least start out talking about.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.500]   I wanna remind everyone, if you have a question,
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.660]   you can put it on the right side.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.860]   I will do my very best to make sure Bill hears about it.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.900]   But Bill, tell us a little bit
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.660]   about "The Delusion of Crowds."
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.020]   Obviously McKay's book, and it's not pronounced McKay,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.540]   fix that for us, but "Extraordinary Popular Delusions
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.780]   "and the Madness of Crowds"
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780]   covered some of the stuff you covered before,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.740]   but you felt the need to sort of, I don't know,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.060]   update it is the right word,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.780]   but tell us a little bit, very briefly,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.820]   about what's the genesis of this new book?
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.740]   Why did you feel the need to look
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.220]   at "Extraordinary Popular Delusions" again?
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.220]   - Well, the genesis of the book was almost 30 years ago
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.780]   when I read Charles McKay's book.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.180]   It's McKay if you're Scotsman,
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.100]   if you're American, it's okay to say McKay.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.020]   Yeah, if you're an American, it's okay to say McKay.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.940]   And I read this book,
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.700]   "Extraordinary Popular Delusions
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.980]   "and the Madness of Crowds."
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.220]   And the original version of this book was written in 1841.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.060]   And it's a remarkable book
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.460]   because it describes many different mass delusions,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.460]   religious ones, and also financial ones.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.900]   And it's most famous for its descriptions
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.780]   of the three great bubbles of the 17th and 18th centuries,
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.700]   the tulip mania, the famous tulip mania.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.460]   He's the one who actually coined that term
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.140]   and brought it into the English language,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.180]   as well as the twin bubbles in Paris and London in 1720.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.340]   And the descriptions are absolutely remarkable
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.060]   of people just going absolutely nuts
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.740]   over stocks or tulips or what have you.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.220]   And how it became a society-wide mania.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.700]   And then it all crashed down.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.540]   And at the time that I read this book in the early 1990s,
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.340]   I thought it was kind of interesting,
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.780]   kind of like a B movie about the Roman Empire,
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.060]   not terribly relevant to anything that I was seeing today.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.220]   And then lo and behold, before my very eyes,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.940]   several years later, the tech bubble blew
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.780]   and people began behaving
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.260]   in exactly the same way that McKay described.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.180]   And I thought to myself, gosh,
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.420]   I've seen this movie before and I know just how it ends.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.340]   And it certainly redounded
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.420]   to the bottom line of my portfolios.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.020]   I was able to ignore the madness and stay away.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.180]   And it turns out that that's not a unique experience.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.620]   McKay has been saving people's bacon for the past 150 years.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.620]   Most famously, Bernard Baruch read the book in 1907
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.220]   and it saved his bacon back then.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.460]   And he was so impressed with it
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.220]   that he actually wrote the forward
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.420]   to the 1932 version of the edition of the book.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.140]   It's been in print ever since.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.820]   So, you know, the book really impressed me.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.140]   And then several years ago,
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.740]   I observed like all the rest of us
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.740]   how the Islamic State was able to attract people
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.860]   from around the world to one of the worst places
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.420]   on the planet to fight and to die.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.900]   And it turned out that they did that
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.820]   with a narrative that was very similar
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.340]   to the one that McKay wrote about in his book
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.980]   about the Crusades and other religious manias.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.380]   And so I thought, you know, the time has come
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.740]   to write a new version of the book,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.260]   an updated version of the book
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260]   and updated with some of the modern science behind it.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.100]   Now I have a trigger warning about the book,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.060]   which is more than half the book is about religious manias.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.300]   And if that's not your cup of tea
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.420]   or if you're a particularly devout follower
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.260]   of one religion or another,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.500]   you may not want to read the book.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.860]   But if you're interested in financial manias,
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.020]   you're interested in the psychology behind financial
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.060]   and religious manias, then proceed at your own pace.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.420]   - Well, I read every word of the book, Bill,
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.420]   in preparation for this.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.740]   And I have to say, I marveled at your stamina
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.260]   to go through so many hundreds of years of religious mania.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.420]   The Anabaptist chapter was fascinating.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.740]   It really was something.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.940]   I want to get to the conclusions here of the book,
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.380]   because even though there is some,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.460]   I understand modern challenges about McKay's interpretation
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.140]   of how severe the mania thing was.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.940]   As you know, there's some modern research
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.420]   that suggests it wasn't as bad,
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.460]   but I don't think that really matters.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.540]   I think there's a whole point to all of this,
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.340]   which is that the way human brains are structured,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.260]   people tend to keep behaving the same way
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.220]   over and over again.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.060]   I'm wondering if you could get to the core point
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.860]   about the book, the lesson from the book,
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.460]   which is why humans tend to hurt a bit,
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.260]   why they're so susceptible to manias of all types.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.700]   Can you give us the conclusion here
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.180]   of what the book concludes, essentially?
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.220]   - Well, the book is really a meditation on human nature.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.220]   First and foremost, we are running around this planet
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.020]   with Stone Age brains, brains that evolved
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.940]   during the Stone Age, in the Space Age.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.860]   So we're navigating a Space Age world with Stone Age minds.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.020]   And the first thing that you have to know about human beings
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.260]   is that first and foremost, we are the ape that imitates.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.180]   We do what other people around us do.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.060]   And the question is, why do we do that?
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.540]   And the answer is pretty simple.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.220]   The best way to think about it
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.620]   is to think about the spread of humankind
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.860]   throughout North America and South America,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.180]   which took place over a very short period of time,
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.940]   several thousand years,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.020]   from the Bering Strait down to the Tierra del Fuego,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.060]   maybe at most 10,000 years.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.500]   And in the process, human beings had to learn
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.900]   how to make kayaks and hunt whales and seals,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.500]   and then hunt bison on the Great Plains,
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   and then to fashion pulleys and blowguns in the Amazon.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   And if you've never done any of those things before,
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.940]   you're never going to figure it out for yourself.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.540]   So you have to find the one lucky person or people
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.060]   who gradually over time figure out
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.980]   how to do each of those things, and then you imitate them.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.100]   So it turns out that imitation
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.780]   is an enormously valuable skill
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.100]   to the survival of our species.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.900]   And it served us very well during the Stone Age.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.140]   But in a modern post-industrial society
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.740]   where you have to invest decades in advance,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.100]   it's not so salutary.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.820]   Now, the other characteristic
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.820]   is that we are the ape that tells stories.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.380]   You know, when Stone Age hunters
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.540]   went out to hunt a mastodon,
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.940]   they didn't issue each other vectors
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.660]   or mathematical descriptions or geometric descriptions.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.420]   They just, one guy said to the other,
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.740]   "Hey, you go right, I'll go left,
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.580]   "and we'll spear the beast from both sides."
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.180]   Okay, we tell stories, in other words.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.300]   And so we are uniquely susceptible
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.020]   to narratives as opposed to hard facts.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.780]   So those are the two basic characteristics
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.540]   of why we behave the way we do
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.420]   in the modern capital markets.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.660]   - So narratives are essentially shortcuts
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.300]   to understanding the world, is that correct?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.260]   And sometimes they can hijack
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.660]   the more rational center of the brain.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.940]   There's a very important point here
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.300]   about narratives that you're trying to make.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.060]   - Yeah, narratives, it turns out,
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.380]   are the way that we understand things,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.020]   and we respond much more to narratives
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.380]   than to dull facts.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.540]   And I'll give you an example of this,
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.380]   and it's political,
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   but I'm even gonna mention Donald Trump's name,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.980]   but I think it's pretty neutral,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.660]   which is that late in 2015,
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.820]   during one of the Republican nominating debates,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.780]   the primary debates, somebody asked Ben Carson
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.060]   about vaccinating his children
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.460]   and whether we should be vaccinating children or not.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.620]   And he gave a very good scientific answer.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.980]   He's a neurosurgeon after all.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.620]   And he said, "Look, I've seen the data,
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.380]   "and the data is that it doesn't cause,
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.500]   "vaccinations don't cause autism,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.340]   "and we should vaccinate our children."
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.860]   Now, he was a good Republican,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.340]   so he said, "The government shouldn't force us to do it."
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.820]   It was a pretty good answer, okay?
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.620]   And then Donald Trump broke in and said,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.700]   "I had an employee who had a child, a beautiful child,
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.060]   "and she was vaccinated, and she got autism."
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.380]   And this is turning into an epidemic, I tell you.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.220]   Every single person, every single political talking head
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.620]   who saw that scored that in Trump's favor, okay?
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.100]   Even though he had gotten the facts completely wrong,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.300]   because he had a better narrative than Ben Carson did.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.260]   And that's something we see time and time again
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.460]   in the capital markets.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.380]   - Right, and that narrative, in that case,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.380]   that narrative appealed to the fear center in your brain,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.340]   whatever, the amygdala,
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.980]   whatever part of your brain that went off,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.460]   and it had more relevance than simply stating a dry fact,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.980]   which is the evidence is that there is no problem
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.540]   with vaccination and autism.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.300]   - Yeah, the message went straight to the amygdala,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.540]   and that pathway is very fast,
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.740]   and it overwhelms the pathways
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.820]   to our higher thinking centers in the cortex,
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.540]   which are very slow.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.060]   - Right, let me move on to bubbles,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.100]   and let's try to make some conclusions about what bubbles.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.860]   One interesting thing about bubbles
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.580]   is they all exhibit certain characteristics in common.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.460]   You had a very interesting discussion about Minsky,
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.140]   who was a fairly obscure economist,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.380]   as far as I can tell,
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.660]   but is sort of now widely cited
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.460]   for his study of bubbles and bubble conditions,
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.860]   and he noted there were two essential factors.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.900]   I'm not sure there's just two,
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.860]   but you point out in the book
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.100]   that in order to have a bubble,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.500]   you need to have very cheap money, credit,
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.380]   and you need a revolutionary technology.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.940]   Can you very briefly discuss that,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.340]   and are there other factors
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.220]   that modern scholarship might have identified?
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.980]   They all have something in common, that's my point,
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.180]   and we should all be able to recognize and say,
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.100]   tulip mania bubble and the dot-com bubble
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.380]   actually had something in common,
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.100]   and these are the common characteristics.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.420]   - Yeah, the two driving characteristics
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.180]   of any financial bubble are cheap credit
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.420]   or low interest rates,
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.300]   which is another way of saying that,
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.020]   and a revolutionary technology
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.740]   that captures people's imagination.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.420]   So, for example, right now,
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.900]   what's there to invest in?
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.460]   You can't put your money into bonds
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.420]   because they have a near zero yield
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.100]   with any reasonable quality at all.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.540]   You can't put your money into traveling.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.580]   You can't go to restaurants.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.780]   It doesn't make any sense to buy nice clothes
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.540]   as we both demonstrated right now,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.740]   so you put your money into stocks.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.020]   Well, the stocks of what companies?
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.100]   Well, you pick whatever is the most exciting technology
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.620]   you can find, whether it's cryptocurrency
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.820]   or Tesla or whatever,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.580]   and so the price gets driven up,
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.340]   and that becomes a self-reinforcing phenomenon.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.580]   The more prices rise, the more money that people make,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.140]   the more excited they get,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.620]   and eventually, it reaches a breaking point
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.420]   where it explodes,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.340]   but you can say what's going to happen,
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.540]   but you just can't say when.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.180]   - Yeah.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.060]   There's been some other studies that have done
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.220]   that add a few other things
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.380]   besides easy money and disruptive technology,
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.900]   so I guess financial innovations,
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.060]   I mean, so the mortgage products
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.140]   that were introduced in the 1990s, for example,
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.460]   that helped lead to the financial crisis.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.260]   Maybe some other things like supply/demand imbalances
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.940]   and things like that.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.140]   Let me ask you about a very specific bubble right now.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.900]   I'm going to defer back to the book,
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.780]   but I want to divert and go right to this point
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.300]   'cause I've had questions here about Bitcoin.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.260]   Is Bitcoin a bubble?
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.700]   Is it a mania?
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.420]   I'm not asking you to pronounce long-term
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.580]   what you think of cryptocurrencies.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.980]   If you want, go ahead,
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.700]   but let me try to make it very immediate right now.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.460]   Give us your thoughts on what's going to happen to Bitcoin.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.580]   - Well, I'll try not to be inflammatory.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   I will not use terms like coinpocalypse or cointastrophe
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.620]   or cointribulation.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.940]   I will simply say that there's a lot of...
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.020]   (laughs)
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.860]   There's a lot of-
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.700]   - I love it when you talk in parentheses, which is great.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.980]   I don't want to use apocalyptic terms,
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.620]   but let me name them right now.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.660]   - Yeah.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.220]   - Go ahead, I'm just giving you-
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.060]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.900]   I deserve that.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.220]   What I will say is that there's a lot of speculation
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.860]   by people who are less than well-informed
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:56.980]   and the history of how this falls out
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.220]   is not very encouraging.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.460]   And that's the whole point of reading the Mackay book
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.740]   is you see not only the manias,
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.500]   but you also see how they ended.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.460]   Now, not all manias end in a bust.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.180]   Maybe only 80 or 90% do.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.180]   It's been pointed out to me that there were some manias
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.620]   that really didn't result in a horrible bust
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.660]   that are relatively obscure examples.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.180]   For example, there were three railway manias in England
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.820]   during the 19th century.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.980]   And the second one really didn't end in much of a bust,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.500]   but the other nine or 10 ones that you can easily name did.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.260]   So yeah, there's no question in my mind
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.220]   that Bitcoin is a mania.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.540]   And the question is, why do I say that?
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.260]   Because they fit Mackay's descriptions
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.900]   and the Mackay description of a mania,
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.260]   as well as what we all observed during the housing crisis,
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.700]   during the housing bubble, excuse me,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.820]   or during the tech bubble of the late '90s
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.380]   were four things.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.500]   And the first thing that you see
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.220]   is that speculation becomes topic A.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.260]   When everybody starts talking about a given investment
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.460]   at a party or when they meet casually,
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.260]   that is a bubble, all right?
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.220]   When you see people who are quitting otherwise good jobs
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.500]   to trade assets,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   thinking they're going to become fabulously rich
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.620]   and they'll never have to work again, that is a bubble.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.860]   And then there are two other things
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.940]   which are a little, not as commonly observed,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.660]   but are still characteristic,
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.660]   which are when skepticism is met with vehemence.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.660]   I can remember several times during the late 1990s
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.220]   when I expressed skepticism about the tech bubble,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.740]   being basically told that I was an idiot,
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.460]   if not seeing my parentage insulted.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.100]   That sort of vehemence, you're also seeing with Bitcoin
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.380]   as well, people will get very angry at you
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.700]   if you express skepticism.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.540]   You're an old fogey, you just don't get it.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.140]   You don't get it or you just don't get it
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.380]   are five words that you hear very frequently
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.540]   at the top of a mania.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.660]   And then finally, it's extreme predictions.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.660]   Bitcoin's not going to go to 100,000,
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.420]   it'll go to 500,000 or a million or 10 million
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.980]   because don't you know, they're not making any more of them.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.420]   When you start hearing those sorts of extreme predictions,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.900]   that's the fourth factor.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.140]   And we've seen all four of those things right now
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.100]   with Bitcoin.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.380]   - Yeah, I agree with your point.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.580]   The only I would point out is, as you pointed out in the book
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.980]   .com was a bubble, it blew up, but the internet lasted.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.860]   Why can't Bitcoin blow up, but blockchain really does last?
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.580]   Doesn't that seem like a lasting technology to you?
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.420]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.660]   And this is one of the central points
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.100]   of the financial section of the book,
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.420]   which is that bubble investors turn out to be
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.340]   capitalism's philanthropist.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.540]   They wind up losing a lot of money
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.460]   in order to fund these technologies that last.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.980]   So there's no question that blockchain may turn out
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.500]   to be a very transformational technology
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.900]   in the way we do finance.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.700]   It's just that the people who are investing
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.100]   in the Bitcoin related companies
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.300]   probably aren't going to benefit.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.700]   The best example of that I had in--
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.740]   - The Fiverr, right?
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.940]   - Yeah, it was Fiverr. - WorldCom, right?
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.220]   - Yeah, it was WorldCom.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.820]   I mean, the people who invested in WorldCom
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.340]   got taken to the cleaners,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.460]   but the Fiverr that WorldCom laid
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.420]   still is something like 20%
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.060]   of today's submarine traffic capability.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.660]   So WorldCom and Gary Whittock,
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.300]   the guy who did the company,
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.060]   absolutely savaged his investors,
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.380]   but he was a real benefactor
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.740]   to society and the world at large.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.580]   - Yeah, I agree with your point.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.580]   I have no idea whether Bitcoin is worth 5,000 or 50,000.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.020]   Just, I don't have any idea whether, you know,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.420]   it's worth somebody spending $69
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.340]   for a non-fungible token or NFT that just happened.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.300]   I used to collect comic books in the 1960s.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.620]   Somebody just paid 3.25 million
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.460]   for the first "Superman" action one the other day.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.340]   And you might say, "What idiot is gonna spend 3.25 million
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.460]   "for a comic book?"
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.700]   But somebody did.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.500]   So I'm very agnostic on prices.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.580]   What I am excited about is blockchain
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.140]   is a long-term disruptive technology.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.460]   I think it's gonna last.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.740]   I would pay very close attention
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.220]   to the Coinbase direct listing this week.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.860]   That's gonna be, depending on how that thing prices,
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.100]   that could force another whole new wave
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.260]   of investment in crypto, because that thing is so big.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.660]   We literally don't know what it's worth,
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.860]   50 billion, 100 billion.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.100]   It's literally don't know.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.940]   But I'll give you an idea.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.180]   If it goes at $50 billion,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.260]   NASDAQ is currently valued at 25 billion.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.020]   The New York Stock Exchange, with ICE,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.460]   with the entire organization around New York Stock Exchange
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.940]   is 65 billion.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.060]   So essentially there's an exchange here.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.340]   It's really an exchange, Coinbase,
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.460]   that is suddenly valued as much as the New York Stock Exchange
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.180]   and all the exchanges that are built around the NYSE.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.460]   Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.500]   I don't know if that's signs of a bubble or mania,
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.980]   but it's a sign that a lot of people think
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.020]   there's a lot of potential
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.580]   in blockchain technology in general.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.940]   And that's what I think people should pay attention to.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   Let me just move on.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.260]   You mentioned the sort of bubble path,
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.300]   the physiology, diagnostic signs.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.660]   You had the four P's that I liked very much, the promoters.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.420]   So you need somebody out there
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.580]   and talk about the new technology.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.340]   You need participants, you need buyers.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.900]   You need a press.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.420]   One of the things Robert Shiller pointed out
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.500]   in "Irrational Exuberance," another book
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.780]   that I got in the first three years going down to the NYSE.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.740]   I met Shiller and when it came out in 2000,
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.220]   I think, "Irrational Exuberance,"
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.340]   I met him just after that.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.740]   He pointed out that one of the common characteristics
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.340]   of mania was bubbles first started appearing
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.700]   when the press started appearing in the 1600s.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.900]   And he was very big, just as you were,
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.820]   pointing out the role of the press
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.820]   in helping promote these manias.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.140]   And politicians, of course, getting involved various ways
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.380]   in either promoting them or changing the law.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.700]   So I don't have a question here, Bill.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.140]   I just want everyone to realize
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.580]   that what are the characteristics of bubbles?
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.620]   They mean four things, the promoters, the participants,
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.500]   the press, and the politicians.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.940]   Is there anything you want to add to that at all?
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.580]   I'm doing a little learning thing here
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.460]   for everyone who hasn't read the book.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.140]   - Well, yeah, what I do is I have this medical,
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.500]   I'm a doctor, so I have this medical model of bubbles.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.580]   So we already talked about the underlying path
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.900]   of physiology, which is the Minsky criteria,
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.540]   credit and technology, be it financial or technological,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.100]   to which I add two things, which are amnesia.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.180]   And then, and particularly the fourth thing
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.140]   is the amnesia for traditional valuation criteria,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.460]   which go down the drain during a bubble.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.100]   And then there's the anatomy
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.420]   and these forced locuses of the anatomy,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.620]   which you just mentioned.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.020]   There's the promoters, the participants,
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.700]   the press, and the politicians.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.140]   And to me, the most fascinating thing in the book
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.420]   that I wrote about in the book were these promoters
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.060]   of the various schemes involved with the bubble.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.260]   So starting with John Law,
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.860]   with the Mississippi Company bubble,
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.380]   and then there was a guy in London named John Blunt,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.340]   who was a real scoundrel.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.500]   And then there was a man by the name of George Hudson,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.260]   who basically built out a lot of England's rail network.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.900]   And a man named Samuel Insull in the 1920s,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.700]   who built out the electrical utility infrastructure
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.340]   of a large part of the country.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.660]   And both of these guys, both Hudson and Insull,
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.060]   left us with very valuable infrastructure,
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.020]   enormously valuable infrastructure,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.740]   but they also became the capitalist heroes of their age.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.740]   And eventually wound up almost going to jail for fraud
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.660]   because of their fraudulent financial dealings.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.660]   And whenever you see, and the lesson here
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.660]   is that whenever you see somebody lionized in the press
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.500]   as being the capitalist genius of their time,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.100]   you have to really look out, okay?
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.900]   We have two very recent examples of that,
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.100]   one of which has already blown up,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   which is Adam Neumann with WeWork,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.900]   who was this very charismatic guy
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.980]   who just went completely off the rails
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.140]   in terms of the way he managed WeWork,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.500]   because he was so charismatic
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.540]   and got so little negative feedback,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.180]   he went completely off the rails.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.060]   And then of course, the one who's still left standing
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.740]   is Elon Musk, who may wind up as a hero
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   who will transform our transportation technology
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.940]   and other technologies as well.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.300]   But he's also showing some very worrisome
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.060]   characterological signs that you often see
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.180]   with these people who are the recipients
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.180]   of large amounts of adulation in the press.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.620]   - Yeah, but he may be real.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.700]   I mean, honestly, the man has revived the space program.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.820]   I mean, I grew up like you did in 1960s.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.900]   I'm a science fiction fan.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.500]   I grew up with Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.820]   And Arthur Clarke wrote "2001, A Space Odyssey" in 1968.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.540]   And it was about 2001 going to Venus.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.860]   I mean, my generation grew up with the whole,
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.300]   where's my jet pack crowd?
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.460]   Like what happened?
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.620]   Where did the future go?
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.820]   And I mean, Musk has helped revive the space program.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.740]   I mean, Thomas Edison was real.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.700]   He was a real person.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.100]   He had his own problem, but there was a Thomas Edison,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.100]   who really was a genius.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.100]   So I agree in terms of brain characteristics
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.700]   and maybe some mental disorders,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.220]   he exhibits some characteristics,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.900]   but so far he has remarkably delivered.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   And I'm very close to the SEC,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.820]   and I'm aware of how much agita he's given the SEC.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.620]   And I think he's obviously bent at the securities laws
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.740]   with his comments on Twitter.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.420]   But I think the guy is brilliant.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.940]   And even if he stopped right now,
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.420]   his contributions would be significant.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.780]   I don't know about the valuations of Tesla at all.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.700]   I tend to be very agnostic on those things.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.100]   But I mean, you do admit genius does exist, right?
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:25.940]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.980]   And I agree with every single thing you said,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.860]   and I make that point in the book.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:36.180]   George Hudson and Samuel Insull transformed
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:42.740]   the England and the United States respectively
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.620]   in the way that we live.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.060]   They were absolute geniuses,
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.100]   but they did not come to good ends
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.940]   because of the hubris that evolved
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.060]   in the course of doing all the wonderful things they did.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.500]   So the question really is,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.820]   is does Elon Musk wind up like Samuel Insull,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.500]   which was not a good ending.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.180]   Insull actually wound up dying penniless in Paris.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.340]   Or does he wind up like Thomas Edison,
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.860]   who will be remembered?
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.580]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.700]   I would not be surprised either way.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.140]   - Or Tesla himself, what happened to Tesla?
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.180]   He's a brilliant man,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.620]   and really essentially ended up with almost nothing.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.260]   I wanna move on because we've had some specific questions
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.740]   from the listeners,
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.580]   and I wanna try to address them.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.540]   We've got a half an hour lesson.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.020]   Folks, if you've got some questions, let me know,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.660]   but I try to get to a couple of them.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.540]   Very specific questions in general about investing.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.900]   I don't know how much you wanna take them,
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.340]   but I wanna do something I'm very interested in,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340]   which is what should we be advising people to be doing now?
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.620]   I'm obviously a Jack Bogle disciple,
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.620]   and I spend a lot of time ETFs
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.980]   and index investing in general.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.340]   Do you feel, in my view,
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.780]   ETFs and index investing have generally triumphed?
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.780]   It is widely known now that almost all active management
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.700]   is not successful over long periods of time.
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.700]   Not that there isn't, I know Jack would always correct me.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.260]   It's not that there isn't any.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.340]   We have very good active investors at Vanguard and VAT funds,
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.660]   but they're rare, and it's hard to find them,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.060]   and they cost too much.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.660]   So with that said, how do you feel about the progress
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.420]   of, lack of a better word, the Jack Bogle ideology,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.420]   the keeping costs low, generally index funds?
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.380]   Do you feel that that is winning the day
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.540]   compared to, say, 20 years ago?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.140]   - Very, very slowly.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.260]   And what I worry about is that the learning curve
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.180]   may be shallower than the birth rate, all right?
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.020]   I see it happening, and I certainly,
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.180]   certainly you walk into a Bogleheads conference,
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.460]   and you think that everybody has got religion
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.780]   and is doing things right.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.300]   And within the confines of a Bogleheads meeting,
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.940]   yes, that's very true.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.100]   But when I walk out into the wider world,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.340]   and I talk to people about investing,
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.140]   my sampling shows a very low incidence of Bogleheads.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.260]   For every person that I meet that's read "Bogle"
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.260]   or "Rick Ferry" or "Larry Suedro,"
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:26.260]   I meet 50, 100 who are still listening to their stockbroker.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.100]   - Right, well, isn't this because literacy in general
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.500]   is not very good?
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.220]   Financial isn't very good.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.940]   I mean, the education system is failing us.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.620]   I mean, what really disturbs me,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.100]   I mean, I belong to the skeptical inquirer group,
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:48.140]   and you're not taught critical anymore.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.420]   Critical thinking in science,
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.140]   critical thinking, inductive reasoning, you're not taught.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.740]   Why would you even be taught financial literacy?
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.300]   Like, what's the Federal Reserve?
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.380]   What's a stock and what's a bond?
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.340]   People come out of high school,
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.380]   it's shocking how little they know.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.820]   I graduated in '64.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.540]   I had not a single course on finance.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.900]   I learned how to type.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.300]   I learned a little mathematics, trigonometry and geometry,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.740]   a little science, a little history,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.980]   but I literally didn't know how to balance a checkbook
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.780]   when I was 18.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.700]   Literally, I had to learn it myself.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.660]   So, shocking that this happens?
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.180]   - Yeah, no, it's not shocking at all.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.460]   There's that, the fact that Americans
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.740]   are very good at critical thinking.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.380]   Of course, Europeans and Asians
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.860]   are even more enamored of active investing
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.700]   than we are here in this country.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.180]   There's very little of an indexing community
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.620]   outside of the United States, maybe, and Canada.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.460]   So, there's that,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.980]   but there's a more basic factor involved here,
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.780]   which is how compelling are the narratives?
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.380]   What my book is really about,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.660]   aside from disquisition on human nature,
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.660]   is it's also a story of compelling narratives.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.740]   - Right, so why, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.900]   but this is a very important point.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.380]   Why is active management a more compelling narrative
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.700]   than indexing?
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.100]   - Oh, well, it's because indexing is a very, very dull
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.300]   and non-compelling narrative.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.940]   It's invest in three different index funds,
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.940]   spend 15 minutes a year doing it,
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.780]   and don't even, don't think about it beyond that
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.260]   and go about and live your life.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.500]   That's a very dull, uncompelling narrative.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.340]   The real narrative is to turn on the financial media
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.540]   and watch Jim Cramer jump up and down on the desk
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.340]   in a gorilla suit and go booyah.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.780]   That is what compels people,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.260]   or to hear a corporate executive come
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.220]   and talk about what a great company he has,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.420]   or to hear a, listen to a strategist,
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.980]   a market strategist from a large bank
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.260]   talk about where he thinks the market is going
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   in the next six months.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.740]   That's much more compelling than buy three funds
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.660]   and rebalance it once a year and forget about it.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.540]   It's just that the bogey head narrative is so dull.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.060]   Now, where the bogey head narrative wins, of course,
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.180]   is on the data.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.020]   But as we've already talked about,
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.780]   narrative always trumps data.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.620]   - Yeah.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.220]   It's funny, I spent a lot of time
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.500]   with the academic community.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.900]   And of course, the academic community
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.100]   has a very dim view of the active management community,
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.060]   but they call them out.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.660]   We know the numbers and the data.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.300]   I covered the SPIVA study.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.100]   Well, they're out twice a year, which is S&P.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.220]   But that's something I can get on the air every year,
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.620]   twice a year.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.260]   So the academic looks down
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.060]   on the actively management community.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.540]   And the active management community
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.660]   despises the academic community
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.940]   because they call them out on it.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.140]   They think they're a bunch of eggheads.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.060]   And the active management community
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060]   and the academic community
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.620]   also somewhat looks down on financial press
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.380]   because they feel, that's us folks, that's me.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.340]   We are too complicit in going along
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.220]   with the active management narrative,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.100]   which is also, you bring up in your book as well.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.900]   So there's a lot of compelling,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.220]   there's a lot of competing forces that are going on here.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.420]   I will tell you, I'm afraid I don't just,
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.940]   I don't agree with you with your idea
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.700]   that indexing is not winning.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.100]   I was a proponent of ETFs from 1997,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.140]   and the time I became,
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.060]   and I've seen nothing but victory in indexing forces.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.140]   I know people in the, I'm close to this community,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.740]   the active management community.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.180]   They're terrified.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.980]   They are really worried that indexing is sweeping the world.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.180]   So I've agreed everything you said,
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.380]   but I really think the bogey heads are winning.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.140]   And the active management community is terrified.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.220]   And you see it in their responses in the last 10 years,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.860]   old fogies coming out and saying,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.740]   "Oh, wait 'til this ETFs blow up,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.740]   'cause there's not enough of the underlying stuff out there.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.860]   It's all gonna blow up."
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.100]   It's all a lot of nonsense.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.140]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.780]   Saying, "Oh, this is like communism.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.060]   It's like brainless thinking."
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.140]   All nonsense.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.980]   People know what high costs are.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.500]   People have better understanding.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.700]   The whole fund community is moving towards ETFs.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.260]   They're moving towards lower costs.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.420]   So I don't, am I crazy, Bill?
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.860]   I mean, did anything I said make any sense there?
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.700]   Don't you?
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.540]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.380]   I agree with you.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.500]   And remember, when you asked the question initially,
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.940]   I said, yes, the bogey heads are winning.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.460]   But what I'm saying is they're winning very, very slowly.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.900]   It's a glacial process.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.660]   And it could be that my sampling of people is skewed
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.140]   in the sense that I'm talking to relatively ordinary people.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.020]   But when I, just my acquaintances,
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.140]   to the extent that anybody who lives in Portland
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.580]   is ordinary, I suppose.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.100]   But what I'm getting at is that,
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.380]   what I guess I'm trying to say
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.100]   is that the people who really matter,
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.900]   yes, are the people who are in the HR departments
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.740]   who are picking the funds.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.940]   They're picking Vanguard funds.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.780]   It's true.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.500]   They're picking low cost index funds.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.980]   Now, almost anybody in any kind of a decent,
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.180]   let me phrase it differently.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.580]   20 years ago, it was very hard
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.940]   to find a decent 401(k) plan.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.860]   Now, you look at most 401(k) plans,
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.420]   and most 401(k) plans have very good low cost choices.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.980]   So the battle is being won, I think,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.020]   at that very high level.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.100]   But when you ask the average person on the street
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.980]   about indexing, and you ask them about finance,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.460]   to them, finance is the guy on the TV
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.220]   who's picking stocks, and it's their broker.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.340]   It's not the wisdom of Jack Bogle.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.180]   - Yeah.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.860]   Let me just move on here a bit
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.780]   and talk about the three fund portfolio,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.660]   because people ask me all the time,
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:10.660]   what portfolio would I find compelling?
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.220]   And I said, "Investing should be simple.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.620]   It shouldn't be that hard."
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.740]   And I always bring up the three fund,
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.540]   the Bogle has three fund portfolio book,
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.700]   which is basically some combination
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.340]   of total stock, total bond, and international.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.380]   I'm wondering if you feel that still is a valid look.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.940]   And what I'd love to do is,
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.900]   I constantly get people who send me 20 portfolios,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.980]   very impressive, and many of them are indexing.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.340]   They're not like crazy.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.980]   And they say, "What do you think of this?"
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.940]   And I say, "Well, this is very interesting,
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.620]   but I wonder how your 20 fund portfolio
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.900]   would stack up against the Bogle had three fund portfolio."
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.180]   And obviously it depends on the mix
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.940]   of the three fund portfolio,
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.260]   but even if you just take, you know,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:03.460]   60, 20, 20, or 50, you know, 30, 20, some combination.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.700]   I wonder, and maybe Rick, you can answer this,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.380]   if we ever did anything that stacks up
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.820]   that three fund portfolio
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.620]   against a really comprehensive portfolio.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.100]   My point is, I think you can show simplicity would work.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.740]   I think that three fund portfolio,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.300]   and again, it depends how you slice it up,
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.820]   would probably perform as well as anybody's, you know,
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.700]   decent broad portfolio that 20 funds in it.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.380]   Any thoughts about that?
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.980]   - Well, yeah, first of all, let me,
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   I would say one thing that's really important here,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.940]   which is it really doesn't matter whether you have
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.340]   a 20 fund portfolio or a three fund portfolio,
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.700]   because in the end, what is far more important
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   than one of the, you've got, you know,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.340]   20 funds sliced and diced all these different ways,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.700]   or a simple three fund portfolio,
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.500]   what matters more is that you stick
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.140]   to whatever your discipline is,
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.380]   stick to whatever your allocation is.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.180]   That is far more important
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.780]   than what your precise allocation is.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.540]   And that's really what you should be training to do,
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.220]   is to have a portfolio that you can stick with
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.540]   through thin and thin.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.860]   Now, the second thing that I want to say
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.580]   is that I'm a big fan of the three fund portfolio,
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.300]   and it has done particularly well
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.980]   over the past 15 or 20 years,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.020]   because this has been a particularly bad period
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.780]   for pretty much every other asset class
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.980]   you'd want to look at,
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.180]   whether it's value stocks or small stocks,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.340]   or more of a weight to foreign stocks.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.780]   If you did those things,
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.780]   you're not going to do as well as you would have done
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.300]   with a three fund portfolio.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.940]   I'm not sure that that's going to be true going forward,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.140]   but again, that's angels on the head of a pin.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.900]   What's far more important is that you pick an allocation.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.820]   Now, there's something that in my mind
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.500]   may even be better than a three fund portfolio,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.740]   and that's a one fund portfolio, okay?
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.340]   If you've got a good target date fund in your 401k,
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.100]   that's really all you need, all right?
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.340]   And the advantage of a one fund portfolio
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.020]   is because you're not going to see the international
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.780]   or the foreign stock part of that portfolio
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.020]   get horribly creamed.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.260]   It won't be as visible,
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.180]   even though you own it when you own a target date fund.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.900]   You're not going to see that in the pricing.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.740]   You're not going to see that,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.660]   "Oh my God, one of my components lost 55%
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.260]   "over a trailing 15-month period,"
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.900]   as has happened a couple of times
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.980]   in the past couple of decades.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.660]   - Yeah, I'll give you one, Vanguard Wellington.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.100]   If you had a, people ask me all the time,
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.380]   if I had to one fund, I'd say, that's a hard one,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.260]   but I'd pick Vanguard Wellington myself.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.100]   I think-
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.460]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.260]   Wellington is the one non-indexed fund
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.300]   that I do recommend happily to people.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.140]   - Yeah.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.980]   - Or wealthy.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   - Yeah, just move on.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.820]   In terms of factors, there's been a lot of debate
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.620]   about what factors matter in Fama-French models,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.860]   and I've had a lot of discussion
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.860]   with other people about this.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.020]   Is there any evidence that you should continue
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.860]   to have a value small cap tilt to your portfolio,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.220]   or does that matter at all?
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   It certainly hasn't worked in the last decade,
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.100]   but I'm just asking generically,
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.940]   does the factor debate matter to you at all?
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:30.020]   - Well, it matters to me because that's how we invest.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.660]   We are factor loaded,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.140]   and we're quite happy with our results
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.100]   over the past 20 years.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.180]   We were extremely happy with our results
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.420]   from 2000 to 2010,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.780]   not so happy with our results in the past 10 years.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.980]   Over the past 20 years, we're quite happy with our results,
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.100]   but that's the hard part.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.300]   In other words, we do believe that there is a premium
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.340]   to investing certainly in value stocks,
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.900]   maybe even to small stocks,
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.220]   although that's less certain.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.420]   But that premium, if there is a premium,
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.460]   doesn't come for free.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.260]   That premium comes at a cost,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.540]   which is a period like the past 10 years.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.140]   Now, I'm not gonna get into the weeds
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.260]   about whether value stocks have gotten much cheaper
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.660]   than growth stocks have.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.780]   I think that they have,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.420]   and I continue to believe that,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.620]   but there are no certainties in investing.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.940]   I could easily be wrong.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.420]   But if I had to bet one way or the other,
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.820]   I would bet that over the next 10 or 20 years,
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.860]   value stocks will outperform growth stocks,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.180]   but I have no certainty about that.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.220]   - Well, if you believe in reversion to the mean,
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.740]   that would certainly make some sense.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.140]   And we've seen that recently with small cap value
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.980]   being the biggest outperformer this year.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.180]   I wanna hit you on, we've got another 20 minutes left.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.220]   I wanna hit you on six or seven questions
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.420]   the viewers, the listeners are writing in.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.740]   Keep the answers relatively short
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.780]   so I can get a number of questions in.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.180]   Here's one that I think is a good one.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.100]   Why is it so many institutional investors,
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.500]   endowments and foundations in particular,
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.380]   continue to be such firm believers
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.260]   in alternatives and active management,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.380]   even though they know or should know
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.260]   the evidence on all of this?
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.780]   - Two reasons to be very fast.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.460]   Number one is they are facing horrible constraints
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.660]   in terms of traditional assets.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.020]   So if every day plain vanilla stocks and bonds
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   aren't going to enable you to fund
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:28.020]   your participants' liabilities or your spending,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.980]   then gosh, we should try something else.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.660]   And that's something else is alternatives.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.300]   And then the second answer, the second reason is consultants.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.820]   There's an entire consultant industry out there
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.340]   whose rice bowl is basically shouldering responsibility
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.100]   when things go bad.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.220]   So the consultant industry is the consultant
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.820]   is the person you blame when things head South
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.180]   and a consultant isn't going to have a very good,
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.140]   make a very good living
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   if he recommends a three-fund indexed portfolio.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.860]   - Yeah, that's a very good answer.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.500]   I completely agree with that.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   Let me move on.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.100]   The current Bill Miller of the day is Kathy Wood
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.460]   over at ARK Investing.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.940]   She has attracted in nine days,
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.660]   $500 million to her space ETF,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.740]   even though she has almost nothing to buy there
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   and has got here is considered a space investment.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.980]   But let me just ask you any particular thoughts
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.820]   on Kathy Wood as the new current superstar?
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.540]   - Well, if you know anything about mutual fund history,
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.820]   she's an easily recognizable type.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.300]   She's the superstar who bakes three or 400%
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.260]   over a couple of year period and then flames out.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.380]   My favorite was Ryan Jacob, which is an interesting story.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.100]   Ryan Jacob ran the Internet Fund back in the late '90s
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.340]   and then he switched to the Ryan, excuse me,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.260]   the Jacob Internet Fund, I think it was, after that.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.140]   And that fund posted returns of, I think, 300%,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.060]   one year, 200% the next year,
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.940]   and then proceeded to fall in price by 95%
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.300]   between 2000 and 2002.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.620]   Now, what's interesting is that fund is still around.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.540]   And if you string together all of his results,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.700]   he actually beats the S&P 500.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.980]   But I don't think there are any sentient beings
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.700]   in this quadrant of the galaxy
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   that actually held on with him for 22 years or 23 years.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:30.460]   And so he's a perfect example.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.020]   So do I think that Kathy Wood's portfolios
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.020]   are going to crash and burn?
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.260]   I think it's highly likely because you could name
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.300]   not just Ryan Jacobs, but Garrett Van Wagoner,
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.660]   Helen Young Hayes, Bill Miller,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.980]   all people who did very well
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.100]   for a relatively short period of time,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.180]   except Bill Miller, he did well for 15 years,
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.380]   and then imploded.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.660]   That's the history.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.340]   - Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.740]   The first conversation I ever had with Jack Bobo,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.020]   that's exactly what he said to me in 1997.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.020]   And it was about Bill Miller.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.460]   He said, "He's a very decent fellow,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.260]   "but you understand how rare they are."
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.540]   So in a sense, I hate bringing up the...
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.140]   Somebody's gonna be a superstar
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.700]   just by the sheer numbers of people
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.180]   that are out there picking stocks.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.300]   Somebody's gonna hit it right.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.700]   And so we're gonna anoint them as geniuses,
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.740]   even when, as the academics would say,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.340]   it's a statistical probability
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.780]   that someone's going to be correct.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.060]   So I always go back and forth between...
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.580]   Should we ignore anybody that's successful?
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.540]   No, I would say you're just a statistical anomaly,
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.020]   therefore you're not important.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.860]   I don't think so.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.700]   But I think people should be very aware
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.380]   of the point that you're making.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.900]   - Let me interrupt and just add one fast thing,
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.660]   which is that if you're gonna run a stock picking,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.220]   you enter a stock picking contest,
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.260]   like the ones that get done at the high school level,
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.900]   you don't invest in the S&P 500.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.380]   You would pick the hairiest, riskiest tech stocks
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.020]   you can find, and you hope that you just hit it lucky.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.420]   That's how you win that contest, right?
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.620]   And it's the same thing with superstar fund managers.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.460]   That's what they do.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.260]   They have very concentrated portfolios in very hot areas.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.340]   And that is a recipe in the long-term for failure.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.180]   - Yeah.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.580]   By the way, I forgot to ask you, what do you own?
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.740]   I know that's...
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.180]   I don't wanna be personal too much,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.860]   but people always ask me the question,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:26.140]   and I'm always amazed how rarely anybody ever asks
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.620]   people in private, what actually do you own?
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.020]   I've owned about a dozen funds.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.660]   They're all Vanguard funds and almost all index funds,
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.820]   but I tried paring it down over the years
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.180]   and I'm getting better at it,
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.780]   but I don't know, what, generically, what do you own?
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.300]   - Well, on the bond side, it's very simple.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   I own pretty much almost exclusively treasuries
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:52.100]   with a bit of munis in my taxable portfolio.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.940]   And on the stock side, I use Vanguard for total stock market
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.540]   or large market in the stock space.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.780]   And for the small and value tilt, I use Dimensional.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.340]   - Yeah, wonderful organization.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.140]   I think very highly of Dimensional.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.260]   And there's another organization
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.140]   that's transitioning to an ETF platform.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:21.500]   And obviously with Eugene Fama there on the board,
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.340]   a big thing.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.340]   Let me get to some more specific questions here.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.180]   There are actually,
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.620]   people actually want your investment advice here.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.380]   You asked Bill about buying corporate bonds through ETFs.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.100]   I understand he said not to do that.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.700]   Is there a specific recommendation?
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.380]   There seems to be a lot of interest in bonds here.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.060]   - Well, I don't like corporate bonds in general.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.780]   And this is, I guess, where I part company with Jack Bogle,
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.140]   because what you're doing is you're getting extra yield,
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.540]   but you're doing it by taking equity-like risk.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.380]   And I'm a big believer in having a risky part
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.900]   of the portfolio, which is long-term,
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.580]   and then a riskless part of the portfolio.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:04.100]   You know, if you invested in corporate bonds, for example,
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.820]   in 2008, you had the experience
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.980]   of watching what you thought was a safe asset
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:14.180]   lose five or 10 or 15% of its capital value.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.380]   And that's the money, you know,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.460]   that's the money you're gonna live on
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.300]   when you lose your job.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.260]   That's the money you're going to use
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.060]   to buy stocks at the fire sale.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.860]   And it is very discouraging to see that head south
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.820]   during a real financial crisis.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.500]   And not overly fond on top of that of ETFs,
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.380]   because of the spreads that open up.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.260]   You know, you can have this,
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.740]   there's this philosophical argument
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.580]   is what's the real price?
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.260]   Is the real price the open-end fund price
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.100]   at the end of the day,
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.700]   or is the real price the ETF price?
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:48.220]   Because quite a gap can open up between those two prices.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.620]   But there's no question
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.100]   that the open-end price functions better.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.220]   So if you're going to own corporate bonds in a fund,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.540]   you're probably better off in an open-end fund.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.340]   - An open-end fund.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.780]   - Correct, not as opposed to an ETF, yeah.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.060]   And I'm not a big, as I said,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.860]   I'm not a big believer in owning corporate bonds anyway.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.340]   - So you, in your personal fund, in your tax account,
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.940]   you own all treasuries?
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.620]   - Treasuries and a bit of munis, yeah.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.460]   - Okay.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.860]   And you don't, it's not that you don't like corporate bonds.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.380]   You don't like corporate bonds in general.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.940]   Some people don't like bond funds themselves
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.740]   because they keep rolling over and having new bonds
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.540]   and there's a lot of people come on
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.580]   are owning individual bonds,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.460]   whether they're corporate bonds or treasuries or munis.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.900]   You're not making that distinction
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.420]   between the funds versus owning them individually.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.980]   You don't like corporate bonds in general.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.940]   - In general, and again, you've asked another question,
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.740]   which is, what about owning individual corporates
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.180]   versus owning a corporate bond fund?
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.500]   And owning individual corporates
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.820]   is not a game that individual investors should play.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:02.260]   Those are relatively opaque, mark very high spreads.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.300]   Leave that to the person at the fund company
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.740]   who knows what they're doing.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.980]   - Yeah.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.060]   Some questions on international investing.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.660]   You know, I remember talking to Jack in 2006,
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.820]   I actually called him and said,
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.300]   I'll show you mine if you show me yours,
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.460]   tell me what you own.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.540]   And he declined to do that.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.940]   I think his son ran a hedge fund at the time
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.380]   and he had some money in the hedge fund with his son,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.220]   but he made it very clear.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.780]   Largely, it was total stock and total bond.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.740]   And I was surprised he didn't seem very big
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.140]   on international investing.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.900]   I understand he kind of changed that as time went on.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.260]   How do you feel about international investing right now
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.500]   as a percentage of the portfolio?
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.860]   Where does it fit in?
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.100]   And if you can give me a percentage,
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.580]   maybe that's tying you down too much,
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.620]   but should it be 10%, 20% or...
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.980]   - Well, here's the way I look at it,
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.140]   which is that very, very roughly,
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.980]   and I haven't looked at it recently, I'll admit.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.620]   You know, the world stock market
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:01.540]   is roughly half foreign and half US, all right?
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.900]   So efficient markets would tell you
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.100]   that's about what you should be.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.220]   You should have an equal amount of the two.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.500]   Now, having said that,
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.220]   there are good reasons to tilt toward the US.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.020]   Number one is, especially in a sheltered account,
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.660]   you lose the foreign tax advantage that you have
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.220]   by owning it in a taxable account.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.020]   So that's number one.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.300]   Number two, you're going to be spending US dollars
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.380]   in your retirement unless you're moving to Europe
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.780]   and you'll be spending euros.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.220]   So you wanna take the currency risk,
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.260]   a little bit of that currency risk out.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.460]   So you should certainly tilt more heavily towards US stocks.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.660]   So, you know, if your portfolio is 50/50,
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.260]   there's nothing wrong with being 30/20 or 35/15.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.180]   In other words, you know, my set point is somewhere
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.180]   between 30 and 40% of your stock portfolio being foreign.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.980]   - Do you have any problem with, for example, China,
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.500]   where, you know, viewers, some viewers call in and say,
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.180]   "Bob, you know, for every Alibaba
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.180]   "that's supposedly privately owned,
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:10.180]   "a very large part of Chinese stock market is largely,
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.380]   "particularly the older school industrial banks,
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.420]   "largely controlled by the government.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.260]   "Nominally, they may seem private,
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.180]   "but in fact, the government controls them."
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.580]   Does that figure into your calculation?
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.740]   Does it matter, does political systems matter
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:33.380]   even when China has capitalistic characteristics?
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.220]   Does that, where does that fit in,
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.500]   the political situation in terms of investing?
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   - Well, Chinese equity has a much, much bigger problem
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.620]   than what you just talked about, which is dilution.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.700]   All right, and all you have to do is step back
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.020]   and look at things from the Chinese market for 50,000 feet.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.980]   And what you see is that over the past,
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:57.980]   I don't know, 28 years or so that the data's been kept,
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.220]   the return on Chinese stocks in US dollars
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.860]   has been paltry, a couple of percent at most.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.020]   And that's, you know, that's only been very recently
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.740]   that it's actually nudged into positive nominal territory
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.100]   with the results of the past couple of years.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.260]   And the reason for that is equity dilution.
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.220]   It doesn't do you any good at all
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.940]   if an economy is growing at eight or 10% a year
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.220]   if the stock pool is being diluted at 20% per year,
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.100]   which is what's happening in China.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.900]   To give you the opposite example, over a very long term,
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.580]   the Swedish market has had about the highest returns
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.740]   over the past 120 years of any developed market.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.580]   Why is that?
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.500]   Because the Swedes don't dilute their stock pool, okay?
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.900]   So that's a good reason to be wary of emerging markets.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.940]   And it is a problem with emerging markets index funds
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   because they are now very heavily weighted towards China.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.660]   And I might add parenthetically,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.620]   it's why I prefer DFA's emerging markets funds
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.260]   to Vanguard funds, because they're less exposed to China
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.780]   than the Vanguard fund is.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.900]   - Yeah, that's a very good point.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.620]   A couple of more specific questions.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.620]   We had somebody, several people asked about insurance.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.540]   A couple people asked about long-term care
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.300]   and life insurance policies.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.260]   I don't know if you want to comment on that
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.380]   or if you feel strongly about that.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.180]   Had a couple of questions on annuities in general.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.660]   I know annuities have changed in the last 10 years,
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.980]   but any thoughts on any of this?
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:28.820]   - Yeah, I'm gonna pass on long-term care insurance.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.900]   That is just well beyond my field of expertise.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.220]   My strategy for long-term care insurance
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.920]   is to acquire enough assets so that you don't need it.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.180]   And I have to admit, I don't have a lot of advice
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.220]   to offer to the person who can't do that.
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:51.620]   And then your second question is annuities.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.460]   I have nothing against fixed immediate annuities,
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.540]   the simplest, cheapest possible product, a SPIA,
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.020]   a single premium immediate annuity is a fine product
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.420]   with one caveat, which is don't even think about buying one
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.780]   until you've figured out how you're going to
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.420]   delay social security until 70,
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.900]   because that is effectively the cheapest annuity
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.020]   and the best annuity that money can buy.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:20.020]   - Yeah, so rather than maximum social security,
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.980]   well, full social security is 66 years and four months,
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.380]   right?
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.500]   - It depends upon your age, yeah.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.660]   - Yeah, and so if you stay till 70,
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:31.860]   you get about 30% more, right, I believe so.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.700]   - Per year.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.940]   - Yeah, somebody at 66 and four months
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.780]   would get $3,000 a month, would get 4,000,
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.140]   they stay till 70, I think.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.180]   - Yeah, in other words, if you take, you know,
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.460]   $100,000 to cover your residual living expenses
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:51.620]   between the time you're 66 and four months and age 70,
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.100]   okay, that is the same as buying an annuity
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.660]   that not only yields close to 8% or about 8%,
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.780]   but it's also an inflation protected annuity,
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.020]   which you can't buy for love or money now anywhere else.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.700]   - Yeah, and of course, a lot depends on your guessing
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.620]   how long you're going to live.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.820]   I mean, if you think you're going to die at 73,
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.780]   obviously getting-
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.420]   - And your spouse, in other words, it's a joint problem.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.060]   So if you're convinced that both you and your spouse
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.940]   are going to be pushing up the daisies
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.900]   long before your time, then yes, don't buy, don't do that.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.460]   But for 90% of people, it's a good choice.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.620]   - We only have two or three minutes
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.260]   and I pledge to everyone, we get out on time,
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.980]   but let me just ask you about the debate
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.020]   about the 60/40 portfolio,
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.540]   which never made a lot of sense to me particularly,
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.180]   and seems to be under assault
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.380]   for the obvious reason we're all living a lot longer
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.500]   and bonds aren't returning much.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.100]   But can you give us two minutes
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.660]   on that whole debate, the 60/40 portfolio?
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   Is that even useful to discuss anymore?
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.540]   - It's still a thing.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.380]   I have nothing wrong.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.380]   I have no problem with a 60/40 portfolio.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.940]   I mean, it really depends
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.780]   upon your own personal circumstances,
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.180]   in particular your burn rate, okay?
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.140]   If you're 60, if you're retiring at age 60
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.620]   and you've got a 5% burn rate,
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.140]   a 60/40 portfolio may very well put you in a bad place
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.700]   if you have a bad initial sequence.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.740]   On the other hand, if your burn rate is two or 3%,
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.980]   it almost doesn't matter what your asset allocation is
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.180]   as long as you have at least
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.900]   a reasonable amount of money in stocks.
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.580]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:26.460]   - But I mean, one thing I might add
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.260]   is that you hear this every five years,
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.420]   the 60/40 portfolio is dead.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.580]   And I've heard that in one form or another
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.580]   for the past 30 years.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.420]   It's wrong.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I agree.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.500]   Folks, it is precisely two o'clock.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.180]   This has been wonderful, stimulating.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.980]   It's a great honor to be with the Bogleheads.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.420]   I hope to be back with you again.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   And Bill, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.860]   I've been a great admirer of your work for many, many years.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.340]   Rick Ferry is back with us.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.860]   And Rick, I'm an admirer of your work too.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.620]   And I really would like, I would get on the air
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.980]   a Boglehead three portfolio.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.220]   And I'd like to talk to you about it
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.900]   versus a wider portfolio.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.580]   'Cause I think that's a useful way
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.620]   of educating people more about the value of it.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.220]   Part of the problem is,
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.100]   and I think this goes to Bill's point about neuropsychology,
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.940]   is people think if I have 20 funds
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.100]   that this activates my brain,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.260]   plus the dopamine, more than three funds.
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.140]   So it's, I think Bill's right.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.620]   There's nothing wrong with 20 funds,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.660]   but do you really need it?
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.500]   Well, I don't know,
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.900]   but I feel more like I'm more important
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.900]   or I'm activating my brain cells more
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.780]   if I have 20 funds instead of three funds.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.300]   And if we can show them,
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.780]   here's your 20 funds since 1999.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.580]   And here's your three funds since 1999.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.940]   I think that would go a long way towards telling people,
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.220]   all right, calm down.
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.380]   You don't need, you really don't need 20 funds.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.380]   So maybe you have-
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.180]   - Yeah, what you're talking with,
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.820]   a psychologist would call that,
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.500]   call 20 fund portfolio illusion of control.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.180]   - Ah, thank you.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.780]   Okay, maybe we can collaborate and do something on that.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:00.620]   - Well, thank you.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.860]   And simplicity is the greatest genius, correct?
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:07.220]   Take something that's complicated and make it simple.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.220]   And that's a greater genius
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.620]   than having 20 funds in a portfolio.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.620]   But thank you, Bob and Bill.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.340]   I mean, that was a fascinating discussion.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.780]   I mean, everybody agrees that was listening to Guhaan
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.060]   for a couple more hours.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.060]   So really appreciate both of you being on today,
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.500]   a wonderful discussion.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.780]   And we hope everyone who joined today
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.700]   enjoyed this presentation.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:31.580]   It was recorded and it will be available on bogleheads.com
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.900]   and on the boglecenter.net website.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.140]   Our next Boglehead speaker event will be in May
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.700]   with a guest to be announced soon.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.060]   So thanks for joining us and see you next time.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.980]   And thanks, Jim, for hosting this.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:45.900]   It went great.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:46.900]   - Thank you.
