[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.960]   We close the week talking about technology
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   and Pastor John, because we often get questions
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.000]   from listeners who know that you use technology
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   all the time in your Christian walk.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   Explain for us here today how you use technology,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080]   how do you do Bible reading on your iPad,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.400]   and how do you use Bible software on your laptop,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.800]   and how do you use podcasts and audio books
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.740]   to serve your soul?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.720]   How does all of this technology work for you?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.840]   - I think the first thing to say is that nobody
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.740]   should try to copy anyone else in this regard
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.740]   because our circumstances and our needs and our gifts,
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.760]   our vulnerabilities are so different.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   So perhaps the best way for someone to listen
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.240]   to what I'm about to say would be to listen
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.580]   for possibilities, not prescriptions.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580]   My use of technology for reading and for listening
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.460]   and for watching can be divided roughly,
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.380]   it seems to me as I've thought about it,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.940]   though I may be overlooking something,
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.940]   into one, Bible, two, prayer, three, reading for spiritual
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.740]   and intellectual growth and enrichment,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.460]   four, listening for both entertainment
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.780]   and growth and enrichment, and five,
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.840]   awareness of what's happening in the world
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.000]   and culture and evangelicalism,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.100]   and six, relationships with family.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.220]   So those are the categories.
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.860]   Let me just say a word about each one.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000]   Bible, I've been reading through the Bible once a year,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300]   the whole Bible once a year, as long as I can remember,
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.280]   maybe starting in my 20s.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.780]   I really can't remember when I first started,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.400]   but as long as I can remember, I've been doing this.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.560]   I've done it now for quite a few years on my iPad
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   using various Bible software.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.060]   Now I'm using Logos software.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.480]   It provides a way for my daily readings.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.280]   This year I'm using McShane's reading plan,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.840]   which gets you through the whole Bible once,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.940]   through the New Testament twice, through the Psalms twice,
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.040]   reads about four or five chapters a day.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   And Logos enables me to see on my home screen every day
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.960]   what the next place is to be read in the Bible.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.280]   And you just click on it, it takes you to that place.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.240]   And when you're done with that place,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.580]   you say done or finished, and it takes you to the next place.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.520]   And so it's just unbelievably, unbelievably convenient.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.900]   And there's several reasons why I do it,
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.440]   why I read my Bible electronically.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   One is that I can save verses easily for later meditation.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.400]   I use Evernote.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   I'm sure there's a way to do it in Logos itself,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.560]   but I've been using Evernote for a long time.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.400]   So I use Evernote.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.560]   I create a folder for Bible quotes
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.880]   and specifically Bible promises.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.480]   And then I can look at these later in the day or later on
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.640]   to remind myself of what was especially powerful
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.960]   or precious in the reading that morning.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   So just a click or two, and the verse that I'm looking at
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.160]   that's meaningful to me at this moment
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.120]   I can be saved for later on in the day.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.560]   Another reason for reading the Bible electronically
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   is that one of my purposes for using Twitter
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.680]   is to send out Bible verses or Bible truths three times a day
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.920]   and virtually all of these come out of my daily reading.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.600]   And the electronic version enables me to cut and paste
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.040]   into Twitter or Hootsuite very simply.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   So you might say,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.320]   I view this particular use of Twitter that I have
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.640]   as simply an overflow of my enjoyment
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   of scripture every morning.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.080]   And I schedule those out a week or two in advance.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.240]   They just, when they come, they come.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.900]   Another reason for using the iPad
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.940]   is that I'm regularly consulting the original languages,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.920]   Greek and Hebrew, and Logos makes that real easy
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   with a split screen to have Greek or Hebrew right there
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.300]   when I'm doing my meditation so that I wanna check
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.900]   and see what's behind this word, I can do it.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   And another reason is that when I get ideas
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   for articles or books or blogs or sermons,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.940]   while I'm reading, I can quickly put a note in
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.900]   or cut and paste to my Evernote file on various topics
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.540]   so that I'm ready to go with those ideas or those texts.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.480]   So everything is just quickly streamlined
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.100]   by being able to save things and comment on things
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.260]   when I'm reading the Bible in my iPad.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.380]   And I suppose it goes without saying
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.480]   that I do virtually all of my Bible study
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.140]   on my computer at my desk.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.260]   I'm using my computer right now in front of me.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.620]   My Bible program is open in front of me.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.260]   I use Logos 6 and always have ESV open.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.540]   I have the Greek and Hebrew open beside it.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.380]   I have a search window open beside that.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.740]   I have an open commentary at the bottom.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.260]   I love Alford, my New Testament commentary,
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.180]   though I can click through other commentaries.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.940]   I've got lots of things open here and ready to go.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.000]   So that's Bible.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.460]   That's the category of Bible.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.960]   And I do use BibleArc.com, B-I-B-L-E-A-R-C.com
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   for rigorous arcing and leveling of text.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.740]   But that's for another time to talk about, perhaps.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.540]   Second category is prayer.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.540]   How do people remind themselves
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.580]   of what they want to pray about?
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.100]   Besides praying my way through the Word,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.060]   so when I'm reading my Bible,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.880]   I'm praying over this Word for all the people
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.940]   that I'm concerned about and all the things
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.460]   that the Bible is throwing up to me.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.460]   I also have concentric circles of things I pray about,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.300]   and I keep track of those in my iPad,
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.860]   on an Evernote folder, so that if I kneel down to pray
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.180]   and can't remember all the things I want to pray about,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.140]   I just click open my Evernote.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.020]   It's called Daily Prayers, and I keep it up to date
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.900]   with requests that people ask me.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.100]   So prayer is another way I use technology.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.860]   Third, reading for spiritual
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.860]   and intellectual growth and enrichment.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.820]   I do still read from paper books and love them,
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.420]   and I believe we'll always have them with us.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.760]   I don't think they'll ever cease to be useful.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   But I love the fact that I have all the works of John Owen,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.100]   all the works of Jonathan Edwards,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.380]   all the works of Charles Spurgeon,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.380]   at my fingertips on my iPad, anywhere, all the time.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.820]   This is an incalculable gift from God to me.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.620]   So, for example, I've been reading volume four of John Owen
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.940]   as I prepare to write a book
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.760]   on the affectional use of Scripture in our lives,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.600]   and I've been reading relevant sermons
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.300]   from Jonathan Edwards in this regard.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.540]   And I just finished two lectures from Charles Spurgeon
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.900]   called "How to Read the Bible."
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.340]   And all of these, I've been reading on my iPad,
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.180]   and I've been reading them in Logos.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.880]   And the main reason is because of how easy it is
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.820]   to highlight or to do clippings
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.720]   so that what I just saw will immediately go into a document.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.260]   I can print out that document.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.500]   Oh, I can remember in years gone by
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.420]   how many hours and hours and hours and days and days
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.540]   I would spend underlining books
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.500]   and then going back and typing and typing and typing
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.900]   to try to save what I had seen for use in books and so on.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.660]   And now, oh God, be praised.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.540]   I can just read, highlight, bang, they're in a document.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.340]   These wonderful insights
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.500]   of these great historic lovers of God have been preserved,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.020]   and now I can read them later, I can use them later.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.300]   So reading for intellectual and spiritual growth
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.020]   is done a great deal on my iPad, but not only.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.100]   Fourth category is listening for both entertainment
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.100]   and growth and enrichment.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.540]   The mind, John Piper's mind anyway,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.840]   cannot always be wound tightly
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   for the sake of maximum rigor in analysis and synthesis.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.220]   There's a place for more relaxed, passive entertainment,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.500]   but I personally believe, and here's the vulnerability part,
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.100]   I personally believe that the Christian
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.860]   should not be entertained by things
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.180]   that require a spiritual bath
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.460]   to cleanse the mind when you're done.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.920]   That's not a good way to get entertained,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.940]   and I fear many, many, many evangelicals
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.660]   contradict their own conscience
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.260]   because they're just following the world
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.060]   and what they get entertained by.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.460]   Now, one of the ways I do this
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.400]   is by having audio books on my iPhone.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.760]   Right now, for example, I have a huge book
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.280]   that I'm working my way through, audio,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.500]   namely C.S. Lewis's Essays and Shorter Writings.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.420]   It's a gargantuan book, I don't know how many hours,
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.720]   like 50 hours worth or something.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.260]   And I take a little bit every now and then,
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.900]   and at the same time, I'm listening to a narrative history
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.780]   of the great migration of African Americans
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.980]   from the South to the North
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.980]   called The Warmth of Other Suns,
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.980]   a Pulitzer Prize-winning narrative history
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.180]   that's just knocking me over with sadness
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   because of what I was involved in in those days
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.500]   and the horrors of the background
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.680]   of African Americans in this country.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.820]   And at the same time,
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.720]   I'm listening to Leland Rykin's new biography of J.I. Packer.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.000]   So I got three audio books going at the same time,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.460]   just listening according to what I feel like in the moment.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.520]   And I just finished listening last year
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.800]   to the Brothers Karamazov.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   In other words, I try to listen to fiction
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.680]   if somebody has given me a really good recommendation
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.000]   of something contemporary
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.980]   or if I wanna get back into something historic
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.860]   that I haven't ever done.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.440]   So for example, I think I got this
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.260]   from seeing a pile of books on one of your photographs, Tony,
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.860]   and I took the risk just 'cause it sounded so good.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.180]   I just finished listening to Anthony Doerr's
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.700]   "All the Light We Cannot See."
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.880]   That was deeply moving to me.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.440]   So I listened to these basically in the cracks of my life,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   I listen while I'm jogging, while I'm walking to church,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.240]   while I'm driving to get the oil changed,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.440]   while I'm brushing my teeth, changing my clothes,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.680]   while the teapot is heating.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.760]   The goal is both enjoyment and learning
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.640]   and the awakening of emotions
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.220]   that might not otherwise be touched.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.920]   I think one of the things that great literature does,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.520]   fiction included, is that it touches us
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.160]   in places and ways through insights we haven't had
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.720]   and emotions we haven't experienced
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   that make us wider, deeper persons
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.320]   when we come to the word of God itself
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.600]   so that we are more useful in God's hands
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.280]   and we're more capable of even knowing
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.380]   and experiencing more of him.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.380]   So number five is awareness of what's happening in the world
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.220]   and culture and evangelicalism.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.300]   I get virtually all of my news,
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.020]   both concerning the world and the nation and the state
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.460]   and the city and the wider evangelicalism
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.780]   and world missions and everything else I learn
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.500]   about the world, I get it from the internet.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.060]   We don't have a TV, I never listen to the radio.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:44.500]   It's mediated mainly through my iPad and iPhone.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.180]   So for example, at breakfast,
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.680]   which I usually eat by myself
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.780]   because my wife isn't out of bed yet usually,
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.420]   I look at the news sites to see what's happened
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.980]   in the last 24 hours.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.620]   I look at national sites
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.660]   and I look at my local Minneapolis Star Tribune
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.900]   newspaper online.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.460]   My main use of Twitter on receiving,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.640]   not giving but receiving,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.140]   is to let people become a filter for me
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.060]   of what I need to be looking at.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.340]   In other words, I used to do this by thinking
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.420]   that I could subscribe to enough podcasts
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.540]   to stay on top of things.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.540]   I don't do that anymore.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.540]   It's just unworkable for me.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.060]   I need people like Justin Taylor
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.180]   and goodness, I could name a half a dozen people
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.620]   who tweet out things that they've stumbled across.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.380]   Somehow, I don't know how they do it,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.980]   but they find important things.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.140]   And they cite me, they send me to them.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.460]   And so I go there and if it looks like I need
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.520]   to read that to figure out what's happening
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.340]   that I need to be engaged with, then I do it.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.380]   But almost all of that.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.380]   I do subscribe to a few magazines
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.740]   and I read them both paper and online,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.780]   whichever seems to be easiest at the moment.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.560]   And quickly, just a couple more things.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.480]   There is a use I just thought of
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.420]   that maybe I ought to include.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.860]   Namely, that I have a folder in Evernote
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.580]   called Poems in Process.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.980]   This is probably not what everybody does with Evernote.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.920]   So when I'm sitting on the couch at night,
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   Noelle and I are just sitting there together.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.100]   I have an hour before I go to bed.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.820]   I may open up this folder in my iPad
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.680]   and just work away on a poem that's been in process
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.420]   for a month that I'm trying to write about something.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.380]   So it's a writing device as well as a reading device.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.700]   And finally, I use technology
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.900]   for the sake of my family relationships.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.660]   This is the only use I make of Facebook.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.940]   I hardly follow anybody or whatever the word is, friend.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.560]   I hardly even know how Facebook works.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.780]   I just know I've got family members who are on Facebook.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.980]   And if I put their name in my friend,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.140]   I can see what they're doing.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.140]   And I like to do that.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.940]   So that's my little limited use of Facebook
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.620]   is that I can tell what my kids are doing.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.300]   And I suppose there's just lots more I could say
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.180]   about sermon preparation and look at the book
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.260]   and email and on and on.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.500]   We could do another one of these
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.460]   if you wanna get more specific sometime.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.460]   But maybe in closing, I should say,
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.180]   I regard my computer that sits here in front of me
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.660]   on my desk and my iPad and my iPhone
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.660]   as an incredible gift from God.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.180]   I mean, I can almost come to tears
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.500]   over how precious they are to me.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.860]   And all these pagans are behind it, I know that.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.780]   And they believe stuff I don't believe.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.220]   But for all the misuses that can be made of it,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.940]   for me, it is a treasure chest of the glories of God.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.580]   I see God and I learn of him everywhere I go
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.140]   on these devices.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.060]   The temptations to go in destructive directions
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.560]   are a kind of test that if I weren't seeing them
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.500]   or being tempted to see them on the phone,
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.100]   there would be another way I'd be tempted.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.420]   And so I regard those kind of tests
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.340]   as a proving ground for my faith and my holiness.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.100]   And God has been very, very good to me
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.660]   and good to us in these days
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.460]   to give us these resources, I think.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.300]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.580]   It's helpful to hear you explain all this.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.380]   And if you have a follow-up question
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.420]   on how Pastor John uses technology, send it in to us.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.560]   And for more information on the podcast

[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.360]   We're gonna break for the weekend.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.120]   On Monday, John Piper will address a woman
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.680]   who notices that her pastor is using pre-made sermons.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.360]   Should she be concerned?
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.160]   That and more, including next week,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.840]   we'll talk about "Look at the Book,"
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.640]   this series of videos,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.200]   and when and where is the proper context
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.280]   for using technology to mark up Bible texts.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.840]   All of that and more next week
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.600]   on the #AskPastorJohn podcast.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.440]   I'll see you then.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.400]   Have a great weekend.
