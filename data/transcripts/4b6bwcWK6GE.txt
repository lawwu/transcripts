[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.480]   Welcome.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.360]   That's what I do for my day job,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.880]   but over the last few years,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.760]   I've become very active in teaching neuroscience
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.400]   and neuroscience-related themes on social media.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240]   And I've also been fortunate enough to be hosted as a guest
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880]   on various people's podcasts to discuss neuroscience
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.040]   and neuroscience-related tools.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.400]   So through those discussions and your feedback,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.280]   I've decided to launch a podcast
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.080]   where we dive really deep into scientific topics
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.900]   and the tools related to those topics.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.480]   Now, the format of this podcast
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.680]   is going to be a little bit different
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.780]   than many podcasts out there.
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.760]   Most podcasts jump from topic to topic each episode
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240]   or change guests each episode.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.680]   On the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.440]   we're going to dive deep into individual topics
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.720]   for an entire month at a time.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.960]   So for instance, we might take an entire month
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680]   and go really deep into the topic of motivation and focus
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.840]   and talk all about the science underlying
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   motivation and focus, what's known, what's not known,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.200]   and then discuss the various tools
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.560]   as well as some of the barriers to motivation and focus
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.680]   that exist out there as a way for you to really understand
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.840]   how these processes work within you
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.760]   and within the people that you know,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.000]   and some ways to possibly get better
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   at things like motivation and focus.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   Sometimes it's going to be just me talking to you,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.960]   other times it's going to be a guest here
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.120]   in the studio with me,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   and still other times we might hold guests remotely
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580]   and have discussions with them over Zoom
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.600]   or some other distanced format.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.080]   There's another thing that's unusual about this podcast,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360]   which is that you, if you choose,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.580]   can be a very active participant.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.920]   By placing your suggestions about which topics to cover
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.360]   and which information you would like to learn more about
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.820]   in the comment section,
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.500]   we are going to pay careful attention to those comments
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.320]   and the number of likes that those comments receive.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.760]   So the comment section is a place for you
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.320]   to give us constructive criticism,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.880]   give us praise if you like,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.200]   but most importantly,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.480]   it's going to be a place for you to make suggestions
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   about what you would like to hear more about,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.680]   and we will respond to that.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   So if you have suggestions for topics now,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.680]   please put them in the comment section below.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   If you're coming to this a little bit later,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520]   please upvote or vote for the things
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840]   that you want to hear more about,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.560]   and obviously don't vote for the ones
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.200]   that you would like to hear less about.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.120]   Those are the main features of this podcast.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.500]   Every month, a different topic in depth,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.140]   as well as the tools that relate to that topic.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.960]   I just briefly want to touch on what I mean by tools.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.300]   Tools these days for enhancing one's nervous system
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.560]   or any aspect of their biology and psychology
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960]   come in different forms.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.920]   Some come in the form of behavioral tools,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   so things that you would want to do
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.120]   to get a particular result of say focus
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080]   or enhancing sleep or learning in plasticity.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.660]   Other tools are about not doing certain things
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.560]   to get better sleep or focus or plasticity, for instance.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   Still other tools relate to things like nutrition
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.380]   or supplementation or prescription drugs
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.000]   or brain machine interface,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.740]   devices that you use to monitor your nervous system
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.960]   in biology or to change your nervous system in biology.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.420]   We're going to cover all of that,
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.760]   as well as their various advantages and disadvantages.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.900]   So again, please use the comment section
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.880]   as a place to make suggestions,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.540]   and we will pay attention to those,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.540]   and you really have an opportunity
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.680]   to actively shape the direction of the podcast.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.220]   There's one other thing that's unusual about this podcast,
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.840]   which is that I have a very large 90 pound
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.040]   bulldog mastiff named Costello,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.440]   and he insists on snoring in the background
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.320]   while I'm recording, it seems to be his favorite thing.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.220]   So from time to time, you may hear his snoring
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.860]   or other grunts and various bulldog-like things.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.940]   He is an active participant in the Huberman Lab.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.420]   He's a steady member of the podcast,
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.500]   so you can look forward to more Costello appearances
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.360]   in the future.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.300]   Very last, but certainly not least,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   I very much appreciate your interest in science
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.720]   and science-related topics.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.420]   Thanks so much for your time and attention,
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.240]   and I look forward to seeing you here again very soon.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.400]   (upbeat music)
