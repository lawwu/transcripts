[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   You always know when you live in Gaza that it's only a matter of time before
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.800]   the next bombs drop, you know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.200]   death, people dream about going out in the world and pursuing education.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.720]   People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.920]   In Gaza, your idea of opportunity is an opportunity to see the next year.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.920]   That has been the case.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.600]   And so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum, if people
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.920]   only hear about Gaza on October 7th, that is, that is a major part of the problem.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.720]   And that is again, part of the problem of our ignorance and our apathy, right?
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.360]   Why is it that the plight of the people of Gaza is not brought up
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.840]   until an attack happens on Israel?
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.760]   The following is a conversation with Imam Dr.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.680]   Omar Suleiman, his second time on the podcast.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.640]   He is a Palestinian American, a Muslim scholar, a civil rights leader,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.280]   president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, and is one of the
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.600]   most influential Muslims in the world.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.840]   Our previous conversation was focused on Islam.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.360]   This time, the focus was on Gaza and Palestine.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.120]   This is Alex Friedman podcast.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Omar Suleiman.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   What did you think, feel, and pray for in the days that followed October 7th?
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.240]   I think the first feeling was that there's going to be a lot of
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   death and destruction in Gaza as a result, right?
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.480]   We always kind of see this where one Israeli casualty leads to hundreds
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   of Palestinian casualties, right?
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.960]   So it's a pretty familiar cycle in some ways, where there are daily
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   transgressions against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.800]   The checkpoints, the aggression on Masjid al-Aqsa, the settlements
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.320]   expanding the stories of Palestinian death, and then you have rockets
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.880]   fired from Gaza, and that's when the Western press catches
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.000]   up and starts to cover it.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.600]   Israel responds with hellfire missiles, white phosphorus bombs, and the
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.560]   casualties are wildly disproportionate.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.880]   And so I think that, you know, I wasn't surprised.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   I prayed for the people that I knew were going to bear the brunt.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.400]   Of this outbreak, but the outbreak was predictable.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.440]   You wrote a statement on October 9th.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.920]   I was hoping to read it, if it's okay.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.480]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.560]   "Our Palestinian casualties are always your footnotes, the daily
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   humiliation of occupation ignored, the aggression by settlers and
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   soldiers alike on holy sites and souls, the annihilation of entire
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.200]   families that follows, the devastation of whatever scraps remain in the
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.600]   open air prison of Gaza, unsustainable and inhumane.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.960]   So if you're waking up to a sudden interest in the region and want to
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.320]   know what's been happening, dig a bit deeper than two weeks and try to
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   read beyond the headlines of a media that has been dehumanizing us for decades."
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.280]   Again, this was not surprising.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.480]   This was very predictable.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.760]   If you've been watching what's been unfolding before October 7th, 2021,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.280]   Human Rights Watch puts out the report, "Threshold Reached.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   Israel is an Apartheid State."
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.160]   Amnesty International 2022, "The Crime of Apartheid," showing how all
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   of the legal determinations of apartheid have been reached.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.240]   The occupation is only getting more aggressive.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.760]   Shireen Abu Aqla, a Palestinian American journalist is shot dead in 2022.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.520]   In front of the world, the United States says initially that if it is shown that
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.120]   Israel was complicit or that Israel carried out the execution, then there
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.240]   will be consequences, of course, once it was shown that Israel was indeed
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.720]   responsible for the bullet that killed Shireen Abu Aqla, the United
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.160]   States did absolutely nothing.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.680]   Shireen's funeral was attacked.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.280]   The Palbers were beaten.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.880]   Her casket almost fell.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   And again, the world is watching.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   The aggression against worshipers in Al-Aqsa is getting worse.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.960]   You have the flag march, the Jerusalem flag march, where extremist settlers
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.920]   are let loose and wild on Palestinians by the thousands, chanting
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.360]   things like, "Muhammad is dead.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.760]   We're going to murder you Arabs."
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.320]   All with the protection of the state with Israeli soldiers.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.840]   And throughout this time, it's like something bad is going to happen.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.880]   And then 2023 comes along.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:27.520]   You had 13,000 settler units in 2023, a plan of 13,000 settler units, the most
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.480]   in the history of the occupation, the most racist and extremist government,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.160]   Israeli government that you have ever had, and people don't realize that in
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.120]   2023 alone, over 600 Palestinians had already been killed.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.720]   It just doesn't make Western headlines.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.080]   And so if you wonder why the American public sees this so much differently
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.160]   than the rest of the world, it's because American media shows the American
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.800]   public something so much different than what the rest of the world has shown.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.480]   And so this was a pressure cooker, this was going to explode.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.760]   It is extremely predictable.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.080]   You've given people absolutely no hope.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.480]   And so I think that as we're watching that, it's important for us to actually
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.000]   interrogate the ignorance that people have of the Palestinian plight, the
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.840]   ignorance of the root causes of this violence, the ignorance of the occupation.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.440]   And also ask yourselves, you know, why is it that Israel can violate every
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.640]   single international law on the books, have all these determinations, and the
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.320]   United States keeps on issuing these inconsequential statements, while also
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.280]   at the same time funding these aggressions.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.840]   So it's like, stop the settler violence.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.000]   The United States will issue statement after statement, stop the settler
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   violence, stop the incursions on Masjid al-Aqsa, stop violating the people in
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   Jerusalem, stop trying to wipe out the Palestinian people, stop openly saying,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.440]   you know, that there is no two state solution, that we will never allow
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.120]   Palestinian state to be established.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.840]   But at the same time, here's your $3 billion check.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.960]   And if the United Nations issues any sort of resolution against Israel, or if any
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.560]   international body tries to hold Israel accountable, the United States stands
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.320]   in the way of any accountability.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.080]   It's important for us to ask why.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.400]   And so I always tell people, read beyond the headlines.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.280]   Even now, with the backdrop of a genocide, over 30,000 people have been killed.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.360]   If you open the front page of most American mainstream sites, you will see
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.280]   stories about the hostages, the Israeli hostages, you will see stories about
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.160]   October 7th, but October 8th is missing, October 9th is missing, October 10th is
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.640]   missing, a hundred days of genocide are missing.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.920]   And you'll barely have a story that shows up every once in a while that, you
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.320]   know, is still very much so controlled by the Israeli propaganda machine.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.040]   Because while Israel kills Palestinian journalists, it also makes sure that
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.640]   American journalists are only able to tell a certain story.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.520]   They're only able to see Gaza from a certain perspective.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.040]   They're only able to speak about Gaza from a certain perspective.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.960]   And this is well-documented, that they have to review their media tapes with
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.200]   Israel before they can publicize them.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.160]   And so this is state propaganda at this point.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.080]   The mainstream media and the United States government are in lockstep
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.200]   telling a very skewed story, and that is leading to a greater sense of frustration.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.480]   And I think the American public has been wronged as well by
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.600]   not knowing what's happening.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   - So you mentioned settlements.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.160]   So to you, this is bigger than Gaza.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.400]   It is the West Bank.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.520]   It is the Palestinian people broadly.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.640]   You can't disconnect Gaza from Palestine.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.440]   You can't disconnect the West Bank from Palestine.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.000]   You can't disconnect Jerusalem from Palestine.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.800]   And you can't disconnect the very human story from the political plight.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.280]   You interviewed Mohammed al-Kurd, met him.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.520]   What did the world do when it saw the images of the Kurd household being taken
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.600]   over by a guy from Brooklyn or Long Island who just shows up and lays claim to their home?
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:41.520]   What did the world do when American settlers suddenly decided they could walk
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.320]   into historic Palestinian homes and throw people out of their homes?
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.240]   What did the world do?
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:55.080]   And so, yes, this is very much so connected to the broader issue of Palestinian existence.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   If you realize here, we are erased in peace and we are erased in war.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:05.080]   In peace, it's the Abraham Accords, agreements between Israel and its Arab
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.160]   neighbors, which is supposedly to solve the Palestinian problem.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   The Palestinians are absent from their own fate, from discussions about their own fate.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.960]   In war, it's the Israel-Hamas war.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   It's Israel and Gaza.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.120]   Where are the Palestinian people, the millions of Palestinian people that have
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.840]   either been removed from their land or are being tormented on their land?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520]   Where are they in this discussion?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.600]   - What are the Palestinians in the diaspora feeling?
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.800]   - I think deeply frustrated, a great sense of anger, sadness.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.080]   Every single Palestinian right now knows someone that's been killed.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.680]   Every single Palestinian is a part of a story of displacement or destruction.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.960]   Every single Palestinian has a relative that's either missing a limb or a loved one.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.800]   Every single Palestinian in the world is traumatized by this.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.200]   And in some ways, being outside of Palestine, being away from it all, hurts
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.240]   even more because you see your people being killed and starved and brutalized
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.960]   and slaughtered, and you can't do anything about it.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.520]   And the people around you are justifying that slaughter.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.360]   If you turn on a TV or if you open a mainstream news site, these
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.600]   sites are justifying your slaughter.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.120]   And people are being killed over there because they look like me, because
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.840]   they're Palestinian like I'm Palestinian.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.000]   And so we're watching this in diaspora with agony.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.160]   We can't go, we can't heal our loved ones.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.920]   We can't comfort the people that are there.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:59.040]   I recently spoke to a doctor who's lost 75 relatives, 75 relatives in Gaza.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.920]   And he's a medical doctor.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.480]   And all he wants to do is get in there and just use his medical
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   expertise to help his people.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.000]   And he can't.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.440]   And so we're watching it from afar, but our hearts are there.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.960]   They are in the buildings that are being destroyed.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.080]   They're in the hospitals that are being bombed.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.840]   They are there and they are with the people.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.480]   You're somebody who's always rushed into the midst of a crisis.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.840]   So what does it feel like on a personal level to not be able to do
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.040]   that here, to go to Gaza to help?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.200]   Yeah, it's really hard.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:48.600]   I mean, when any group of people are killed, my instinct and I think a lot
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.440]   of people is to go there to help, whether it's a natural disaster or
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:58.520]   especially after an incident of terror, wherever it is, right?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.360]   It's rush there and do the best that you can to help people get through it.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.920]   So it's been extremely hard to watch this from afar and feel like
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.000]   I can't do anything about it.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.360]   And so that's why instead, I think that most of us are driven to continue
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.840]   to be the voice of the voiceless.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.040]   You know, I always say that if they've made them faceless,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.360]   they can't make us voiceless.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.440]   They have reduced our casualties in Palestine to a number.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:37.880]   The number is hundreds a day, over 30,000 people.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.240]   We're averaging 10,000 people a month.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.320]   The fact that they've been turned into faceless numbers with no stories,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.920]   with no humanity, makes it that much more important for us to tell their
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   stories here and to remind the world that you've lost your humanity.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.200]   If you can watch this unfold and not even have the decency
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.640]   to call for a ceasefire.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.760]   I mean, that's the, that's where we've reached.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.000]   That's how low it is right now.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.440]   Calling for a ceasefire has now become radical.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.760]   Uh, so we have to remind the world that if you're okay with the demolition
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:19.960]   of an entire town or a city or whatever it is that you want to call Gaza,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.680]   because it wasn't always the Gaza Strip, but if you're okay with this and you're
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.480]   okay with this casualty count every single day, it's not just them who are
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.600]   being killed, it's your hearts that are dying and I think that when I look
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.520]   back to Dr.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.400]   Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.280]   and I mentioned this, he wrote about Vietnam.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.640]   He said that if America was to succumb to its spiritual death,
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.160]   the autopsy would read Vietnam.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.000]   I would say that it would read Gaza now.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Speaking of the people, the faces, the voices, one of the people you've talked
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.800]   about, you've posted about, you've written about is Wael Al-Dahdouh and being
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.920]   hospitalized.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.640]   He's a Palestinian journalist and a bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Gaza City.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.680]   What can you tell me about this man?
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.640]   If Wael Al-Dahdouh wasn't Palestinian, he'd be on the cover of Time magazine
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.200]   right now, he would be the most celebrated journalist in the world.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:22.280]   Wael Al-Dahdouh is from Gaza, he has been in Israeli prisons, he has been under
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.400]   Israeli airstrikes, he has seen the worst of the occupation before he's seen the
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.440]   worst of the genocide while on TV.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.000]   I mean, and this is insane when you think about it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.800]   We have over a hundred journalists now, right?
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.920]   That's more than any conflict in history that have been killed.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.600]   And there is sufficient evidence by international watchdogs that this is
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.440]   intentional, that journalists have been killed intentionally, but then their
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:56.560]   families, Wael was reporting on TV when an airstrike hits his wife, two kids,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:03.280]   and a grandchild, he goes to the scene and he said this, you know, you never
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.840]   expect as a journalist to be the subject of the story.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.600]   Suddenly the camera's on him, mourning over his dead wife and kids and grandkid.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.440]   And he's saying, he even says in Arabic, he says, "They're taking it out on our
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.080]   children, they're taking it out on our children."
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.600]   Uh, you know, I've heard this from multiple people that have had relatives
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.440]   targeted that I wish it was me instead.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:34.640]   He gets back on camera the same day because he feels a responsibility to
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.800]   continue to cover the lives of the people of Gaza, he understands that his
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:46.120]   story, as devastating as it is, is not unique in regards to the people of Gaza.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.560]   That there are many people whose families have been killed in airstrikes.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.520]   All 2 million people have been traumatized in some way.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:01.680]   And so he gets back on camera, tells the story again, and then he is targeted
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.960]   himself, uh, his arm struck, his cameraman, Samer Abu Dhaqa dies in front of him.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.080]   He bleeds out, Wa'el watches him bleed out for hours.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.760]   And while any aid workers try to reach them in the building that they were in,
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.120]   uh, snipers would shoot all of those that were rushing to Samer.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.200]   So he watches his cameraman and one of his best friends bleed out to death.
