[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Good Monday, and thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   Well, male and female roles in the local church are clearly defined in the Bible.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.820]   We believe those roles are clearly defined in the Bible.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.320]   But do these roles hold outside of the church and particularly in a parachurch ministry
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320]   structure?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   Increasingly, parachurch organizations are saying no.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.120]   But that's the open question for you today, Pastor John, who joins us remotely today over
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   Zoom.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.480]   The question is from a man inside a parachurch right now.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.160]   I work for a global parachurch organization, which is well known.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.360]   Recently, our leadership decided that all positions of leadership within the organization
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.160]   will be open to women.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.260]   This includes campus leadership, regional leadership, and national leadership.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160]   Women will be permitted to teach men from the scripture, to be in positions of spiritual
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.040]   authority over men, to shape and correct doctrine within the organization, and to mentor men
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.640]   in their ministry roles.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.040]   Previously, these positions of spiritual authority over men were reserved for men alone.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.520]   The reason given for this change is that a parachurch organization is not the church.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.880]   Therefore, the commands addressed to churches about the role of men and women in relationship
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.300]   to one another do not apply in this case.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300]   How do you see it?
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.760]   Well, that's sad to hear, to me, but it's not surprising, and it's not new.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:45.400]   The position that the teachings of the Bible concerning sexuality have no bearing on human
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.280]   relationships outside the church or the home is naive.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:00.000]   Actually, to call it naive is perhaps too gentle, because it could also be called culturally
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.320]   compromised.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.360]   In other words, the pressures of our culture to view maleness and femaleness as having
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   no built-in, natural, God-ordained differences that would shape our different relationships
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   and responsibilities, those pressures, those cultural, societal pressures are so great
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.000]   that many Christians today surrender to them, rather than looking like fools in the eyes
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.600]   of the world.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:47.160]   The world today is in a freefall of denial that nature teaches us anything about what
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.480]   maleness and femaleness are for, and that denial used to be, back when I was in the
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.460]   early days of fighting these battles, that denial used to be that male and female personhood
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.280]   teaches us nothing about what God intended our roles to be.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:20.000]   But now the denial is that our bodies, not just our persons, teach us nothing about what
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   life should be as male or female.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.480]   You can cut off breasts, you can cut off the penis, you can cut out the uterus, you can
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.800]   replace estrogen with testosterone, you can grow facial hair on a female cheek.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.600]   So at the root of the rejection that nature teaches us that men and women should relate
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:55.760]   in certain ways is the absolute refusal in our culture, by and large, to allow our individual
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.920]   freedom, the refusal to allow our individual freedom to be limited in any way by an authority
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   outside our desires, whether tradition or God or Bible or nature or instinct or society,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:21.400]   we will not let anything infringe upon our autonomy and the sovereignty of our desires.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.440]   So if God designs women to be women and men to be men, both in their bodies and in every
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:39.640]   cell of their body, and if his designs are written on their hearts, these God-given designs
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:48.960]   must be absolutely rejected because they infringe so obviously upon the autonomy of my sovereign
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.520]   self.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   So at the root of the rejection that nature teaches us that men and women should relate
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.960]   in certain ways and not other ways is the old reality of Romans 8, 7, "The mind of
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.800]   the flesh," that is, the natural fallen human mind, "is hostile to God, for it does
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.880]   not submit to God's law," whether that law is in the Bible or written on the heart.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.040]   Indeed, it cannot submit.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.960]   Those who are in the flesh, that is, who are merely human apart from regeneration and the
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.720]   work of the Holy Spirit, cannot please God.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.520]   Or 1 Corinthians 2, 14, "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   God."
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   They are folly.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.180]   They are foolishness to him, which is why a person who holds my understanding today
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.000]   would be regarded as foolish.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.540]   So the culture as a whole is in a free fall of denial.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.480]   Everybody in this free fall is on a parachute.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.680]   It's all going to end tragically, the evidences of which are all around us.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.320]   They make you want to weep when you see what's happening to young people, what's happening
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.220]   to relationships, the kind of remorse and regret and carnage that is being unleashed
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:20.420]   on our culture as a penalty for the free fall denial of God and his ways.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:27.840]   And the gravitational pull of this free fall is in almost every movie, every online drama,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.660]   every advertisement, every newscast, so that a person who stands up and draws attention
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.660]   to God's Word or the teaching of nature and questions the wisdom of undifferentiated sex
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:54.740]   roles will not only be thought a fool, but also unjust and very likely soft on abuse.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:02.920]   Even though all the while the sex leveling egalitarian impulses wreak havoc at every
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:10.220]   level of our culture, mocking and distorting the very kind of strength and responsibility
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.540]   and leadership that we so need from men.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.740]   All of that to say, the argument that the biblical teachings on manhood and womanhood
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.540]   don't have any bearing on roles outside the home and church is both naive and culturally
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.540]   compromised.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.660]   Two reasons for thinking this way.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:41.180]   One is that when the Apostle Paul gave his instructions that only spiritually qualified
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:49.300]   men should teach and exercise authority in the church, his argument was not based on
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:58.000]   culture nor on family or church or structures, ecclesiastical structures or any others.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.980]   It was based on two things, the order of man and woman in creation and the dynamics between
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.420]   man and woman in the fall.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.780]   He said, "I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.780]   Rather she is to remain quiet."
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.940]   And here comes the argument, "For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.420]   That's argument number one.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:32.280]   And two, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:42.420]   So Paul saw in the Genesis account of God's Word that built into creation from the beginning
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:48.540]   before the fall was a peculiar responsibility of men to bear the burden of leadership and
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.100]   care.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   And he saw in the way Adam was present and silent as Satan drew Eve into deceit that
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:05.540]   the abandonment of this leadership, in that case in Adam's passivity and silence, the
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:12.220]   abandonment of his leadership bears very bad fruit.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:21.380]   So the fact that Paul gave instructions for how this original design relates to the church
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:28.320]   in no way implies that it is limited to the church or the home.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.860]   That was one application of many.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.500]   And you can see this again in 1 Corinthians 11, where Paul is helping the church preserve
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.060]   the dynamics of manhood and womanhood.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:49.980]   He says at one point, this is verse 14, "Does not nature teach you that if a man wears long
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.780]   hair it is a disgrace for him?"
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.740]   Now what I take that to mean is this.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:08.060]   Has not God put in man by nature the impulse that to take on culturally feminine symbols
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.500]   is disgraceful?
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.420]   And we should agree with him.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.860]   Nature teaches it is disgraceful.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.820]   The Bible teaches and nature teaches.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.740]   We might say today, "Does not nature teach you that for a man to wear a dress and stockings
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.860]   and high heels and lipstick is a disgrace?"
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.620]   Yes, it is.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.220]   And nature teaches that.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.660]   It is written on the heart.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.900]   Humans are suppressing this truth of nature, but it is there.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.900]   It is inescapable.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:54.980]   And with regard to men and women in parachurch organizations, I think Paul would say, "I
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:05.740]   have taught, Moses has taught, nature teaches that it goes against man's and woman's truest
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:13.860]   God-given nature to place a woman in a role of regular, direct, personal leadership over
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.860]   men."
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:24.380]   Now, if you wonder, "Well, what do you mean, Piper, by regular, direct, personal?"
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:31.780]   Then since this is a short podcast, I have to refer you to my little booklet, "What's
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   the Difference?"
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.780]   You don't have to buy it.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.580]   Just go to Desiring God, type in "What's the Difference?"
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.820]   book, and download it for free.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:48.460]   And on page 58 and following, I define regular, direct, personal so that it will, I hope,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.680]   make sense.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:12:00.740]   These are days of great shifting in people's convictions and alignments on this issue of
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.340]   how men and women should relate to each other.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:11.820]   So I pray for our brother who sent us this question, and I pray for myself and all of
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:18.860]   us that God would guide us into truth and give us the courage to stand for it.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.860]   Amen.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.420]   Yeah, and that little 80-page book, "What's the Difference?
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   Manhood and Womanhood Defined According to the Bible," is available right now for free
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.300]   at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.100]   Worth noting at the end of that little book is a list to celebrate the dozens of ways
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.420]   that women can serve God and others and flourish in ministry.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.060]   That list, that book, and this episode today all remind me of something that you said,
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.460]   Pastor John, back in 2014, that there are endless ministry possibilities for women in
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:59.860]   this world that do not put them in a position of spiritual authority over men.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.380]   Such a great and related episode, one to cast a vision for women in ministry, and particularly
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.820]   for women who are called to teach God's Word.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.340]   That was in APJ 388.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.340]   Be sure to check that out.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.020]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.980]   You can find APJ 388 or ask Pastor John your own question by going to our online home at
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.980]   AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.500]   We will see you next time talking about sibling rivalries, sibling rivalries, a common theme
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.480]   in Scripture and a common challenge in the home.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.060]   See you Thursday.
