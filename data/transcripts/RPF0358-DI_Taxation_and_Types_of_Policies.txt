[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's Financial Planning Wednesday, and we're going to round
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.760]   out the Disability Income Insurance series.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.680]   This will be the fifth episode in this series.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.200]   We're going to talk about taxation of premiums and benefits of disability policies.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   We're going to talk about various different types of disability policies that you can
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600]   buy.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.800]   Some of these you'll be familiar with and some of them you will have never heard of.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   And also I'm going to answer your questions, answer all of the listener questions that
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   came in about Disability Income Insurance.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.040]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.360]   Today, we work on that avoiding catastrophe category where we talk about insurance and
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:18.560]   try to pull back the curtains of the disability world yet again.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.840]   This episode is the fifth in this Disability Income Insurance series that we began quite
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   a while ago.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.360]   Episode 337 was the first.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.040]   That one was entitled "Why You Should Buy Disability Income Insurance Before Any Other
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   Type of Insurance Coverage."
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520]   That was the sales job that I needed to do on why you should really focus on disability
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   insurance.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.720]   Next, we covered in episode 339, long-term disability versus short-term disability and
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   I explained why they both can be useful but I spend most of my time with regard to financial
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.400]   planning talking about long-term disability.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.560]   We also discussed various benefit periods, elimination periods, and certain contract
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.480]   terminology such as non-cancellable versus guaranteed renewable for the continuance provisions
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.660]   to understand why these make a difference in your life.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.880]   Then we went on to episode 340.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.480]   That was a Q&A show where I answered should I get a couple of questions on disability
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   insurance.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.360]   354 where I talked about different benefit amounts for disability insurance, how to do
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.400]   a needs analysis, group insurance versus individual insurance, various definitions of disability
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   such as own occupation versus any occupation, and then different policy provisions that
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.840]   you need to be aware of, total disability, partial disability, etc.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.620]   So with these episodes, I guess this is the fourth in the series plus the Q&A.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.120]   With these episodes, I think I've laid a pretty good groundwork for you with regard to the
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.040]   terms of disability insurance.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   Today, we're going to round it out with a discussion of taxation of policies.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.640]   We're going to explain that to you, how these policies are taxed.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240]   I'm going to go through some of the different types of disability insurance that are not
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.520]   so common, not so popular.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.840]   Then I had various questions that came in from the audience on disability insurance.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.800]   I'm going to answer these questions in today's podcast.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.440]   So I hope you enjoy this.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.320]   This should round out the disability portion.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   I think that with the conclusion of this show, I have finished everything that's on the CFP
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.920]   exam with regard to disability insurance.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.320]   Disability is a relatively small area of focus, and so it's relatively easy to be able to
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.120]   dig into and cover everything with regard to disability.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.920]   Before I start today's content, quick sponsor of the day today, number one, is Paladin Registry.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.840]   Paladin Registry is my solution for you for where you can go to find a good financial
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   advisor.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800]   Now, disappointingly, the advisors that you get here are not necessarily always insurance
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   experts.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.060]   They should be qualified and credentialed advisors.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.800]   They should be able to work with you in the areas of insurance or at least be able to
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   give you some input in that area.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.240]   But they're not necessarily insurance people.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.800]   They're investment people primarily.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.440]   I've worked to try to figure out a solution for being able to give referrals for you guys
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.480]   to good insurance companies.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.360]   I haven't figured it out yet.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.320]   When I can make that happen, I'll bring that to you.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.640]   But if you're looking for a financial advisor, a financial planner who can look at disability
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.240]   insurance among everything else, start your search with Paladin Registry.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.280]   Paladin Registry is a registry service.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   So what happens is that individual financial advisors come to the company.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.200]   They apply to be part of the program.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.680]   Paladin researches them, researches their disciplinary records, takes a look at their
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.360]   practice models, et cetera.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.200]   And then if they get approved, then they list them in the registry service.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:39.040]   The way that you get connected is go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N, radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.880]   And that will forward you through to a landing page where you put in your name, your address,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.800]   your info, the amount of assets that you have to manage, all that information.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   They'll take that.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   They'll filter it against the criteria of their advisors.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.560]   And that's why it's important that you put the information that's there.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.720]   I don't think it's overly onerous to put that information, but you need to do it accurately
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.680]   so they can connect you with an advisor who will work with you.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   If you're just getting started and you've got $50,000 of investable assets, then they've
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.560]   got to screen you out from the people who are working with million-dollar minimums.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.800]   If you've got millions of dollars, you've got to put that in there so they screen you
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   out of the people who are not focused on your type of situation.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.560]   So fill in that info there and they'll connect you with a few different advisors who will
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   reach out to you.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   You can schedule an appointment, see if any of them will be a good fit for you to be able
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.360]   to find a good financial advisor, radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.280]   Also quickly, I've been doing a few more consulting calls.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   If you would like to get my input directly on your situation, I'd be happy to offer a
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.560]   consulting phone call to you.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.080]   All the details of that can be found at radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.640]   Now, let's dig into it.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   First thing I want to talk about is taxation of premiums and benefits for individual disability
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.320]   insurance.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.440]   To begin, let me explain the basic concept that you need to know, which is simple.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.640]   You're going to get taxed either on the way in or on the way out.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.040]   In many cases, you get to choose.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.920]   When it comes to insurance benefits, the Internal Revenue Code is relatively consistent.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.600]   You've got to pay tax somewhere and you get to choose where.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.700]   So what I mean is you either can take and deduct the premium up front and then the benefit
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.680]   will be taxable to you, or you can not be able to take a deduction on the premium up
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.080]   front and you can receive the benefit on the back end without any taxation, without any
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.640]   income taxation.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.720]   There are a few exceptions to this general rule, but for the most part, just remember
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.760]   the rule.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.100]   You can either take a deduction up front and not get the benefit tax-free, or you can pay
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.000]   the tax up front and get the benefit tax-free.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.640]   So the way this works with disability insurance is relatively simple.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.880]   If I own an individual disability insurance policy and I'm paying for it out of my own
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.640]   personal pocket, paying for it out of my checking account, well, that's not going to be a deductible
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.320]   expense for me.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.120]   I'm just going to pay for that premium using after-income tax dollars.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.880]   But if I were to become disabled, then at that point in time, I would receive the benefit
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   income tax-free.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.360]   So that's fairly simple for individuals who are going to just buy something themselves
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.580]   in their own individual bank account.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.660]   But what about the situation for those of you who own businesses or what if you're getting
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.240]   benefits as an employee?
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   Well, again, the key is just to remember who owns the contract and who's getting the tax
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.240]   deduction.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.800]   So if you as an employee own a disability insurance contract and you're paying the premium
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.980]   for that contract, then the premiums are not deductible up front, but the benefits are
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.040]   going to be tax-free on the back end.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:11.280]   If on the flip side, however, you as an employee own the contract, but the employer pays the
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:18.240]   premium under a salary continuation plan, then that premium will be deductible by the
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.000]   employer, but the benefit will be taxable to you.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.160]   So the key difference here – and this is where it gets a little complicated.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   If you don't need to deal with this for your situation, just tune me out for a couple of
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.680]   minutes and we'll be done with taxation.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.080]   But there's a big difference when you're setting up in group benefit plans whether the disability
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.320]   policy is being offered under some sort of a bonus arrangement, under a section 162 plan
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.000]   or under a salary continuation plan.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.400]   If the employee owns the contract and the employer pays the whole premium under a bonus
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.500]   arrangement like in a section 162 disability insurance plan, then the premiums are deductible
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   by the employer as a bonus and the benefits are tax-free to the employee.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.180]   So you can set this up a little bit different.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.240]   But in general, if the employer is paying for it, then the benefit is going to be taxable
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   to you.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.120]   If you're paying for it and it's not deductible, then the benefit is going to be received tax-free.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.220]   If you get into a situation where you get into an option where there are partnerships
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.040]   or S-corporation shareholders, then it gets even more complicated.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:35.440]   It is possible that a partnership or an S-corporation can deduct the premiums that are being paid
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.780]   in order to get coverage for a partner in a partnership or for an S-corporation with
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.220]   somebody who has more than 2 percent of the shares in an S-corporation as a deductible
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.980]   business expense.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:53.220]   That deduction is basically the idea is that the premium cost is being included in the
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.740]   taxable income of the partner or shareholder and then at that point in time, the proceeds
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.380]   because they've been included as income and taxed there, the proceeds would be excludable
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.100]   from taxable income.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.340]   So basically what you need to remember is simply that if you're deducting it up front,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.200]   the benefit is going to be taxable.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.820]   If you're not deducting it, then the benefit is going to be tax-free.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.340]   Now let me just go real quick.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.080]   I had a question on this.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.660]   So this is one of the questions that came in from a listener named Dan.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.460]   "Joshua, my employer provides a generous disability coverage and gives employees two
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.460]   options.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.700]   One, pay the tax on the benefit cost and receive disability payments tax-free.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.620]   Two, do not pay the tax, making the disability payments taxable on receipt.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.660]   I am a physician in the highest income tax bracket in California, but I've been encouraged
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.660]   to pay the relatively small amount of tax on this benefit for the potentially larger
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.420]   tax-free income if disability occurs.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   Does this make sense?
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   Thanks, Dan."
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.180]   So Dan, the answer to this question is that probably it does make sense for you to go
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:02.940]   ahead and pay the tax on the premium and include it in your after-tax income so that you can
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.060]   receive the benefit tax-free.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.660]   I can't prove this one way or the other.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.420]   I really can't prove it.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.340]   And it would be great to go ahead and somehow be able to switch it if you knew you were
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.180]   going to be disabled.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:23.900]   But the potential impact, especially if you're a physician and you're receiving large amounts
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:31.540]   of disability benefit revenue if you became disabled, by receiving that money tax-free,
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.100]   the tax savings on that could be very substantial.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.320]   It really could be.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.380]   So in general, I've encouraged people just to say pick it up and pay the – use after-tax
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.700]   dollars now and receive the income tax-free on the back end.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.780]   I do think it would be wise to, as always, run some numbers in your situation because
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:12:01.140]   if your premiums are very high and if you can use that deduction now and it would be
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.060]   advantageous to you, and if you look at the benefits and say, "Well, if I did receive
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.660]   the benefits, how much would that be?"
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.900]   I think it's worth doing some math because sometimes some of these policies can get extremely
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.780]   high in terms of their premium cost and that deduction can be very, very useful, recognizing
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.500]   that that deduction is going to be a deduction that's applicable at your highest marginal
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   bracket.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.340]   But you need to look at it and run the numbers both ways.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.180]   In general, if I have to give you a generalized answer, I say go ahead and pick up the income,
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.380]   pay the income tax now and get the benefit tax-free.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.220]   But I understand why people go the other way.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.780]   So that's the basics of how the taxation works of disability income insurance policies.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:52.180]   Remember that theme when you get to other aspects of types of insurance because that's
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:59.300]   a consistent theme that really goes most of the way through with insurance policies and
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.700]   with the revenue code to understand how it works.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:08.460]   Let's talk about a few different types of disability insurance products that you may
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.980]   like to be aware of.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.260]   First, we've mentioned continually here individual disability insurance.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.700]   And I talked about short-term disability insurance and long-term disability insurance.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.260]   You can purchase these products in the individual marketplace and make sure that you understand
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.380]   that it's basically up to you to solve the needs that you actually have.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.260]   As a financial planner, I think generally it's easier to self-insure for the short-term
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:41.540]   needs and then to pick up the risk with an insurance policy for the long-term needs.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.740]   But you can buy – as an individual, you can buy various short-term disability products
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.540]   in the marketplace and you can buy long-term disability products as well.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.660]   One of the interesting aspects to this is different companies offer some different riders.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.420]   And it's very important when making disability insurance decisions that you're working with
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.380]   somebody who's knowledgeable in this area who can look at your situation and can figure
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.820]   out what the benefits are for you.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   Let me give you an example.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.340]   I think I touched on this in a previous episode but I wasn't sure so I made a note to talk
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.060]   about it here as well.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.100]   There is an option that you can buy with disability insurance.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.300]   It's called a social insurance substitute benefit, SISB.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.420]   And what this works is it's a way of the insurance company transferring some of their
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.940]   risk from the company over to social security.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.380]   And the reason I think this is valuable is because when I used to work with people who
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.660]   were in the blue-collar professions and in the trades, because these types of jobs – let's
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.820]   say you're an electrician or a plumber.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.060]   Because these types of jobs bear with them a larger risk of disability due to accident
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.280]   or injury than does a white-collar sitting behind a desk job, the cost of the premiums
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.180]   is substantially more.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.720]   But I don't think that means that there's any less need for the insurance.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.820]   But what it does mean is often it was harder to fit these premiums into a blue-collar worker's
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.180]   financial situation than a white-collar worker's financial situation.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.700]   If you have the benefit of working with somebody who's working in a professional job earning
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.680]   $150,000 a year and their disability is very inexpensive because they're in great shape
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.740]   and they're working in office, it's not hard to fit 50 or 100 or $150 a month of premiums
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.260]   into that type of budget.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.860]   But if you're working with a tradesperson who's earning say $60,000 or $70,000 a year
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:36.060]   and who is on a job and they know how easily they could be hurt and all of a sudden now
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.020]   the premiums are much more, it's a little harder to fit that in.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.700]   So you've got to make insurance plans fit the budget of the prospective insured.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.480]   There are a few ways that you do that.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:56.760]   One is that what you often do is you often pull back on the benefit period a little bit.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.400]   Where you go from instead of offering a benefit period from 65 or 70, you pull it back to
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.320]   something like a five-year benefit period.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.360]   That'll make a big difference in the cost of the insurance.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.120]   You might pull back on the amount a little bit, make sure it's there.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.200]   You might even stretch out the benefit period.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   All of these things will help reduce the premiums.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   It's reducing the coverage but it's reducing the premiums.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.040]   But often it's still too expensive.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.200]   One way that I used to solve this is by using what's called the social insurance substitute
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   benefit.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.000]   The way it works is in general if you're buying just straight disability insurance from a
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.520]   company, nothing keeps you from applying to Social Security and receiving Social Security
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.840]   disability if you qualify.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.440]   Much harder to qualify for Social Security disability but there's nothing that stops
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.520]   you from applying for it.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.320]   So if you had a $4,000 a month benefit from your insurance company and if you're able
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.480]   to get $1,000 a month from Social Security, you'd get $5,000.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.000]   It would be add on top.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   The way social insurance substitute benefit works is in the contract language from the
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.760]   disability insurance company, there's a clause that reads that you will apply for Social
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.980]   Security.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:15.980]   If you're not approved by Social Security, then the insurance company will pay out the
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.800]   benefits based upon the terms of the contract.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.200]   But if you are approved by Social Security, they will reduce the amount of your benefit
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.000]   based upon the amount of your Social Security benefit.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.320]   So if the same client had a $4,000 a month policy but they were receiving $1,000 a month
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.600]   from Social Security because they were very disabled, then that would cut their benefit
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.120]   from the insurance company to $3,000 but they would still be getting the $1,000 a month
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.520]   from Social Security.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.160]   So sometimes these riders can be very, very helpful if you understand them.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.600]   And because disability insurance is so difficult to compare in a direct way, it's not like
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.720]   lining up a straight 20-year level term policy among five companies and just picking the
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   cheapest.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.840]   You've got to pick all these different options.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.600]   That's why you need to work with someone who understands the riders because these tools
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.080]   in the hands of the insurance agent can be useful to get the premium down.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.680]   Don't ever be scared when working with an insurance agent to speak clearly and directly
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.760]   and figure out how to get the premiums to a manageable level.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.380]   Often it seems like people are fearful of this.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.240]   But you need to first decide, "Do I want or need the insurance coverage?"
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.600]   If the answer to that is yes, because you want it or because you need it based upon
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.640]   a needs analysis, then you've got to figure out how to make it work within your budget.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.800]   And it's not like there's necessarily magic.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.840]   The insurance costs what insurance costs.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.920]   Remember, these things are all invented and designed by actuaries.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:56.600]   And so it's very difficult to get – people have this idea of insurance that somehow there's
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.440]   tons of money and you just got to shop around.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.480]   Remember, you do need to shop around.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.040]   But remember, the actuaries are working and they're trying to be competitive in many
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.520]   markets as long as this company is trying to compete in this market.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.280]   They're working to figure out how do they do it and they're just making different
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.720]   assumptions.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:23.400]   So you're not getting better insurance by getting cheaper insurance.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.160]   You're just getting insurance that costs less but has less benefits.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:35.200]   But you can still solve the bulk of your problems and hedge against the risk even while getting
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.480]   the premium down cheaper to a level.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   You always got to decide.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.920]   Do I go all the way with insurance?
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.960]   Do I go halfway or do I get just the bare minimum?
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.020]   One of the riders that I wanted to mention here and this is what – to introduce the
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.600]   topic of riders was there are different riders that you can use to enhance the benefits of
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.320]   a policy on the backend as well.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.840]   There's a rider that you should be aware of called the retirement protection rider.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.200]   Different companies will have different names for it.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.000]   But some policies, you can buy this rider where it will set aside and provide for you
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.060]   retirement funds if you get disabled for the rest of your life.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:21.600]   One of the biggest costs of disability is the lost time and money to compound for retirement
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   goals.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:30.480]   Let's say that you were very careful with your finances and you were diligently working
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.520]   the job, diligently putting money into your 401(k).
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520]   You were planning for retirement.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.400]   But then you get disabled and you don't have disability insurance.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.520]   Well, remember there are two costs to that.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.320]   First is the current cost, the fact that how do I earn my income now?
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.080]   You start using savings.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.360]   But the other cost is what about the money that I was going to be putting into my retirement
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.120]   accounts and it was going to be growing early on in my career?
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   Retirement accounts don't get funded.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.880]   You don't get your 401(k) match when you are disabled.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.000]   So you can get these riders that will put an option on there where some of them, they'll
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.520]   set aside a trust account for you.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.760]   Some of them, they'll make additional contributions.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.880]   But you'll get a rider here where it will set aside and set aside a retirement fund
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.960]   for you.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   So if you're up in the upper income limits or you're looking at this, you should consider
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.000]   the value of that.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   You should price it.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.720]   You should see what the benefits are and consider that.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   While I'm on the topic of riders, one of the other things that I wanted to mention
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.680]   was the process of getting insurance if you have trouble, if you have some kind of medical
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.940]   condition.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:42.440]   Life insurance underwriting is based upon the chances and the likelihood of your dying.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.180]   So it seems obvious but that's how it works.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.720]   So you can have all kinds of medical conditions.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.960]   But if they don't lead to a statistically expected shorter lifespan, they're not going
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.240]   to impact your chances of – they're not going to impact your life insurance underwriting.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.160]   You can have what seems like a very minor medical condition.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.000]   But if it seems like it might lead to some chance of dying, that will significantly impact
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.200]   your medical – your underwriting for life insurance.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.560]   Here's an example of what seems like minor.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.960]   I used to work with people and sometimes somebody had questions.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.800]   They would have trouble sleeping and I had one client.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.600]   He went to see a sleep doctor.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.880]   They diagnosed him with sleep apnea and they recommended that he use a CPAP machine.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.200]   Well this client said it was ridiculous.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.560]   I don't have sleep apnea.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.760]   It was a bad test.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   Never took the advice.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.080]   Never did anything with it.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.120]   We went to apply for life insurance and it became a significant problem.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.880]   We wound up with a significant cost to him for his life insurance because of the diagnosis
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.720]   of having sleep apnea.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   The medical underwriter, when you apply for insurance, will go through your medical records
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.440]   and they will go based upon what your doctor says.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.520]   Well, sleep apnea bears with it a significantly increased chance of dying in the middle of
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.680]   your – while you're sleeping.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.960]   So that will have this person totally normal, totally healthy.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.200]   No, I don't have any health conditions but a condition like sleep apnea does have a significant
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.360]   influence on your ability to get life insurance.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.440]   So this happens quite a bit.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.800]   On the other hand, you might have people and I can't come up with an example off the
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.360]   top of my head but I know I have people say I have this, I have that, I have this other
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   thing.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.800]   Examples like high blood pressure or cholesterol problems, things like that.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.200]   There will be many people who said, "Well, I've got these problems," but often you
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.160]   can get it in and as long as those conditions are stabilized and they've been stabilized
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.280]   and controlled with medication, you get standard rates or standard plus rates or preferred
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.960]   rates of some kind.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.800]   The reason is that the underwriters, they get very nervous about things that are recently
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   changing.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.760]   If you were just put on blood pressure medicine, that's going to have an impact.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.800]   But if you've been on blood pressure medicine for 10 years and there's a good record there,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.160]   well then chances are it's not going to affect your underwriting rates.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.800]   So the underwriters get concerned about things that are moving but if things are well controlled
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.000]   and your medical history is clear, that might not result in any changed rates.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.400]   With life insurance, the way that risks are handled is based upon changes in the premium
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.440]   because they can't exclude anything.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.320]   If you die, they've got to pay it out.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.800]   So they adjust things based upon the premium.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.600]   They adjust it based upon a ratings classification.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.160]   So you get to standard rates or preferred rates or you get tables, they call them a
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   tabled rating.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.560]   So with a company, it might be preferred, then standard plus, then standard, then table
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.400]   one, table two, table three.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.120]   Each of those comes with a rating adjustment where you're going to pay more money for it.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.680]   But what you also get is you get another system where they'll add what they call a flat extra.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.600]   This is common if you have a hobby or something that bears with at risk.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.600]   You're racing cars, you're a private pilot, you're flying airplanes, you're doing experimental
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.840]   scuba dives, things like that or deep depth scuba dives.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.040]   They'll put on a $3 flat extra, which means for every $1,000 of insurance, they'll add
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.560]   $3 of annual premium.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:23.280]   So if you had a $100,000 policy, then that's 100 times three and so you'll pay an extra
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.120]   $300 per year for your premium because they have what's called a flat extra.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.600]   And sometimes on life insurance, those flat extras will be removed.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.560]   They'll say, "We're going to add a flat extra for this medical condition for X number of
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.960]   years and then you can come back in and we're willing to remove that from the policy with
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   a good medical history."
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.680]   So that's the way it works with life insurance.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.200]   They adjust the premiums because they can't adjust the benefits.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:54.640]   With disability insurance, however, they will add riders, which will exclude certain causes
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.480]   of disability.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.300]   So first let's talk about what disability insurance underwriters find problems with.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.800]   They find problems with things that are likely to affect your work.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.040]   So you might have something like carpal tunnel syndrome.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.860]   Carpal tunnel syndrome is not life threatening.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.300]   It's not going to make any difference with your life insurance underwriting, but it could
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.580]   potentially make a very big difference for your disability insurance underwriting if
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.600]   you're a computer programmer.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.080]   So it's all the medical conditions that you have to worry about go down to not what's
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.360]   going to kill you, but rather what's going to make you sick, what's likely to cause you
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.040]   not to be able to work.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.720]   Something like back pain becomes a huge deal for disability insurance underwriting, where
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.840]   for life insurance, okay, you've got back pain and you're taking a medication to help
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   you with it.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   No big deal.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.860]   If your back pain is not connected to it, something that's going to kill you, we don't
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.220]   care how miserable you feel.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.540]   We just don't care, but we don't care how miserable you feel.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.260]   We just don't want you to die.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.540]   With disability insurance, we care about that back pain.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:59.100]   So with disability insurance, because it's not so cut and dried, meaning life or death,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:05.620]   death certificate or not, they will give you the option of issuing the insurance policy,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.020]   even if you have a medical condition, and sometimes they'll adjust rates just like they
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.140]   do with life insurance.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.780]   They'll charge you additional cost or add some kind of flat extra cost to it, but sometimes
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.300]   what they'll do is they'll offer you a policy with an exclusion rider.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.620]   They'll say, "Okay, we noticed that you have carpal tunnel syndrome.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.140]   We're willing to issue you the disability insurance policy, and we'll cover you for
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.380]   any disability except a disability that's related to your carpal tunnel syndrome and
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.260]   your repetitive strain injury."
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.460]   Or "We noticed that you have back pain.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:46.180]   We'll cover you for anything, any kind of cause of disability except for this back pain
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.940]   that you have."
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.380]   And sometimes this will come with a certain number of years where the underwriter will
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.220]   say, "We'll cover it except in the first three years," or it'll just be on there as a permanent
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.060]   exclusion rider.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.060]   So you should pay attention.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.180]   You should talk about those things and look into those things.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.180]   Again, this is why it's so important.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.180]   If you are going to get insurance, get it before you think you need it because most
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.660]   people don't start thinking about repetitive strain injury and carpal tunnel when they're
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.880]   just normally typing and they're making their work.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.620]   But I've had two family members who have been disabled due to repetitive strain injury,
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.700]   unable to use a computer, unable to click a mouse without significant pain.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.580]   And so these things make a big difference over time.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.220]   Little bit of a sidetrack from my types of disability, but those were just a couple of
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.260]   additional thoughts that I hadn't covered previous in the series I wanted you to have.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.820]   So we talked about individual disability, long-term, short-term.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.400]   There's also obviously group disability income insurance.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.300]   And if you need disability insurance but you can't get it as an individual, you should
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.580]   consider looking into seeing if you can get it within the context of a group.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.940]   When you sign up for group benefits, and if you are a person who has health issues or
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.740]   has disability problems, you should seriously consider working at a company where the group
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.100]   benefits are strong.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.780]   Now their HR coordinator won't like this because it'll mess up their rates if they have a bunch
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   of sick people working there.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.740]   It'll mess up their rates with the insurance company, but that won't be a problem to you.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:20.040]   And you can get in on a disability contract on a group basis where you might have been
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.900]   excluded on an individual basis because of that individual medical underwriting.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.500]   There are also opportunities where you can get what are called multi-life policies, list
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.580]   bill or simplified issue individual disability plans.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.660]   And if you run a small business or run a small company or if you have partners, you should
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:45.020]   talk with your insurance agent about the options of a multi-life discount or a simplified issue
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.880]   plan.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.980]   Some companies are very competitive in these smaller market opportunities.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.720]   Some companies, they do big group insurance.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.580]   They want 3,000 enrollees and that's where they specialize.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.420]   Some companies are really specialized on individual policies.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.460]   But then there are companies who work hard to get this 2 to 10 or 10 to 30 or this type
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.940]   of range of disability contract.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.060]   And sometimes if you have some kind of questionable situation, it's not just if you have a questionable
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.980]   situation, these things can save you money as well.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.600]   But you can talk with an insurance agent and you might be able to put in place a plan for
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.940]   everybody in the company.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:28.780]   Also often, you should ask about the possibility of a multi-life discount when working with
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.300]   your insurance agent.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.940]   As an insurance agent, this is a benefit.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.580]   But if you can get or know of multiple people at your company that have their insurance
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.180]   with the same company, you can go ahead and get a discount for that.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.420]   So this might be a good reason to send your insurance agent around.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.900]   Most people need disability insurance.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.140]   Many people don't have it.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.260]   And so if you refer them to a few of their friends, they'll make some additional sales
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.580]   but it can come with a substantial discount for you.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.780]   So that would be a multi-life discount.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.500]   You should also ask if you're buying insurance and you're working for a company, you should
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.940]   also ask if other people there have insurance, disability insurance with that company.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.700]   The insurance agent will not have access because of privacy records.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.580]   They will not have access to that company to know, okay, you work at ABC Manufacturing.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.980]   Hey, I know we've got four other clients there.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.620]   That's their personal clients where they've actually sold the policies and done the business.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.940]   They are not going to know that.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.220]   But you can go ahead and send an email and say, "Hey, does anybody have a policy with
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.500]   this company, an individual disability policy?
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.780]   I'm trying to get a discount."
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.860]   And if you find maybe three people, two or three, four people, depending on the company's
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.020]   rules, you might be able to get a multi-life discount.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.220]   You can also get these on a simplified issue basis.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:49.260]   And one of the benefits that can come if you can get a few people together is you might
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.100]   be able to get unisex rates and a discount.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.760]   Sex ratings for disability insurance are very important.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.060]   Life insurance for men costs more than life insurance for women by a small margin.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.340]   When you're doing individual insurance, it's a little bit cheaper for women because women
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.700]   are likely to live for longer.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.600]   There's a small difference.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:19.860]   But women are much more likely to be disabled at an early age than are men for various reasons.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.020]   And so the premium difference can be substantial.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.540]   And I've had a few of these situations where I would work with, say, a couple of attorneys
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.180]   at a law firm.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.260]   And it was very much in the best interest of the attorneys, especially if I was working
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.540]   with a female attorney.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.900]   If I could get a few people at the law firm to get a minimal policy coverage, the discount
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:48.420]   by getting to either a multi-life situation or a unisex rate was so substantial that it
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.500]   made all the financial sense.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.340]   And so if you are a – let's say you're a high-power female attorney, a high-power
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:00.500]   female physician, you should talk to your insurance agent and see maybe if you put some
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   minimal contracts.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.180]   And even if you paid for it either out of your company or yourself, if you have a big
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:12.380]   contract for you, a big expensive contract for you as the high earner, but you go ahead
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.500]   and just put two minimal policy minimum contracts for your employees, you might get a discount
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:24.260]   that's even substantial enough to where you save yourself the money on – you wind
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.140]   up getting it cheaper by getting it to a unisex rate.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.880]   The rate differential for disability insurance between men and women is substantial.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.860]   So pay attention to that.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.860]   Guaranteed issue plans can also make a big deal for you.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.460]   I've had clients especially as a financial advisor if you're working with the principal
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.100]   and the principal has some health conditions, you can go ahead and again bring in if you
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.500]   can get a group of say 10 or more employees.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.180]   Even if you're not paying for it or offering as a group benefit, if you can get enough
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.180]   people to participate and you can get in on a guaranteed issue plan, it can help you to
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.860]   cover for a personal medical problem that you might have that you might not have been
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.540]   able to get coverage for.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:12.700]   So just because you can't get disability insurance doesn't mean that you shouldn't
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.660]   necessarily research another way.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.660]   Talk to a good insurance agent.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:23.920]   A good insurance agent might have a creative way to get you coverage.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.720]   Business overhead expense insurance.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.040]   Business overhead expense insurance is another way, especially if you're a small business
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.340]   owner that you should consider buying disability insurance.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.460]   Sometimes with a business it can be difficult to get and prove financially because with
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.460]   disability insurance you've got to do medical underwriting and financial underwriting.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.100]   Oftentimes when you're running a business it can be difficult for you to get enough
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.000]   coverage because you might have, especially in the early years, heavy business expenses.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.460]   So a business overhead expense policy is designed to keep your business going if you are disabled.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:04.300]   It's designed to cover the expenses of your overhead if you are disabled.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:09.820]   So this is important because it allows you to keep your business going concern, which
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:15.620]   is much more valuable to sell in the secondary market, even if you are disabled.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:21.140]   The way these policies work is they come in with a 30 or a 60, 90 day elimination period
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.860]   so they kick in after a relatively short period of time.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.700]   But they only last for a short period of time.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.900]   They're usually one or two years at their maximum benefit period.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.620]   Two years is usually about the maximum.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:40.660]   And so here if I'm running a store and I'm a florist or I'm a, it doesn't really matter,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.580]   I'm a CPA, just something, and I'm running a business and I've got my rent, I've got
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.700]   my utility costs, I've got my advertising expenses, I've got all these expenses lined
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   up.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.120]   If I'm running these things and now if I'm out of business and I'm out for six months
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.740]   or a year, how on earth am I going to be able to cover all of those expenses on an ongoing
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.340]   basis if I'm out of work?
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.980]   It's just probably not going to work.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.180]   I'm probably not going to be able to do it at all.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.860]   And so as a component of this, what you do is you buy this business overhead expense
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:17.100]   policy and if you become disabled, it'll cover these expenses for you for a year.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.620]   And that's usually enough time to either say, "Hey, am I going to be back in the business?"
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.280]   In which case you can pick it up and you can get things going again, or "Do I need to
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.000]   get out and either close or sell the business?"
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.760]   So you might need to go ahead and close, but at least you didn't get behind on your lease
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.560]   and have those problems, or you might be able to sell it.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.720]   Because you've kept your storefront open, you've kept your advertising going, maybe
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.160]   had a friend or family member step in and do the best they could to keep the business
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.320]   going while you were out, you can go ahead and sell it as a going concern instead of
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.040]   just shuttering it and not having anything valuable to sell.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.580]   That's called disability overhead expense or business overhead expense.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.260]   Very very useful insurance policy to be aware of.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:04.020]   Next, there is buy-sell insurance, disability buy-sell insurance policies that you can buy
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.900]   to fund a buy-sell agreement in the event of a disability.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:13.100]   Now to explain what a buy-sell agreement is, if you and I are in business together and
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.100]   you and I are just say we're partners for the moment, doesn't really matter whether
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.060]   we're shareholders in a corporation or whether we're partners, just assume that we're business
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.060]   partners.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.000]   We're tied in together and one of the most important aspects of business advice that
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.980]   you need to think through carefully when you are establishing a partnership is what's the
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.780]   exit plan from this partnership?
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.840]   Because when you and I are getting into business together, we're getting into business together
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.340]   because we think that each of us brings something to the table that's going to be helpful.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.220]   We're going to be able to work together and we're going to bring something to the table.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.780]   But what if I die and now my shares and my ownership of the business now go to my wife?
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.400]   Well you're now business partners with my wife.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   That might work great.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.820]   My wife is a great woman.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   I love her to death.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.880]   Or it might not work great.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.600]   You might or might not want to actually be in business with my wife.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.220]   Probably you don't want that.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.400]   Probably you got into business because you wanted to be in business with me.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.840]   So it's important to understand that when you're in a partnership with somebody, what
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.300]   happens to your partner if they die?
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.500]   What happens to the partnership?
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.980]   Many partnerships just fall apart and this can be a real problem because remember, my
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:30.500]   shares of ownership, my partnership interest, my member units of our LLC that I own or my
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.060]   shares of stock in the corporation that we're partners in, those shares are going to be
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.580]   passed according to my will to my beneficiaries.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.940]   And now those shares come with ownership rights.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.500]   If I'm 50/50 partners, you now have to make business deals, decisions with my wife according
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.820]   to the terms of our partnership agreement.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.500]   What happens if I die?
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.620]   What happens if I become disabled?
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.540]   You and I, we build a financial planning firm together and we're doing great.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.740]   I'm handling the marketing of it.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.140]   You're doing the planning of it.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.940]   And we build this thing bigger and bigger and bigger and we're both doing really well.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.540]   Now I'm disabled.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:13.860]   Well, I can't do the marketing like I planned but I'm also now receiving the benefits of
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.940]   my ownership and my share of the profits.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.380]   I'm receiving my share of the profits because I own the business.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.660]   Now you probably would want me to receive that for a few months.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.140]   You know, Joshua, he's not doing well.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.140]   He's got cancer.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.620]   He's going to get back on his feet.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.460]   But after a while, you're going to start to feel like you're getting the short end of
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460]   the stick.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.180]   How do we make sure that doesn't happen?
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.440]   This is why when planning for partnerships or when you're in business with somebody,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.580]   you plan for all the Ds.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.580]   You plan for death.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.180]   You plan for disability.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.020]   What happens in the case of divorce?
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.700]   It's a big one.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.820]   You and I are partners together.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:59.300]   My wife and I divorce but she's still the beneficiary of my shares and now I die and
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.700]   now you're in business with my ex-wife.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.980]   You might not like that.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.420]   What happens in the case of dissolution?
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   You just want to get out.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.900]   You just sort of just handle all the Ds planning.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.540]   How do you escape from a partnership?
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.420]   You know that plan going in.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.740]   If this doesn't work out, how do we dissolve the partnership?
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.020]   So you can buy a disability insurance policy to fund a buy-sell plan.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.980]   Most people fund their plans with life insurance and this is important.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   You and I have a business.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.780]   It's worth half a million dollars.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   I die.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.980]   You want to buy out my wife.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   What do you do?
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.060]   You have $250,000 cash sitting there but my wife needs the money.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:41.900]   So you buy a life insurance policy on my life or I buy a life insurance policy on your life.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.100]   That works out really well because I die.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.840]   You receive $250,000 from the life insurance policy that you owned on me.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.420]   You take that $250,000.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.820]   You buy out my wife.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.100]   She has $250,000 cash.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.820]   You have the business.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.260]   Everybody has what they want.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.580]   Another episode will cover buy-sell plans in depth.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.420]   We'll cover cross-purchase agreements.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.820]   We'll cover entity purchase agreements.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.540]   We'll cover taxation because that can work really well.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.260]   What you received was you received a step-up in tax basis from your units that you bought.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.260]   My wife received the full value of the company without ever paying income tax on the money
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.700]   – excuse me, without paying tax on the gain.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:27.060]   So this can work out really well because she received – we'll save taxation for another
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   time.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.220]   But many people fund their partnership agreements, their buy-sell agreements with life insurance.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.740]   But they don't fund them with disability insurance often.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.140]   You need to consider it because as I mentioned, if I'm dead, I'm dead and gone.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.540]   But what if I'm still alive and what if I'm still – I'm just disabled and I
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.100]   can't contribute very much to the business but I still want my monthly check and I still
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.100]   want to give input on the business?
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.620]   Well, you want to get me out.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   The problem with this comes in from two reasons.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.420]   Number one, the funding problem.
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.620]   Where do we get the money for you to buy me out?
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.620]   We're in business.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.620]   I'm disabled.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   I'm fighting cancer.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.300]   It looks like I'm going to make it but it's really tough.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.460]   And now you're like, "Listen, Joshua, I love you to death but I can't have you
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.460]   out.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.020]   So where do you get the $250,000 to buy me out?
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.020]   I need the money.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.700]   I'm fighting cancer and you need the business.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.780]   But how do we get out?"
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:22.100]   Well, it would be nice if you had a policy there that was set to pay with a lump sum.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.260]   And these policies, again, they'll work.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.100]   And what these will do is they'll have a very long elimination period, maybe a year,
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.100]   maybe two years.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.900]   You're not going to kick your business partner out after three months of being sick.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.380]   But after two years of being sick or a year of being sick, you might want to.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.940]   And then they come with a lump sum.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.820]   You can structure them either with a lump sum or a series of payments if you need to.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.500]   But usually a lump sum would be the best.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:52.060]   So if I were disabled, I'm fighting cancer, a year into that thing, the disability policy
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   triggers.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.540]   It pays you $250,000.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.860]   You buy me out for $250,000.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.260]   I've got the cash.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.260]   You've got the business.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.260]   You're happy.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:05.060]   Now, the second reason why you want to fund a disability insurance agreement with a life
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:10.540]   – excuse me, with a disability buyout policy is because it gives you an objective third
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.380]   party who can determine the definition of disability.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.820]   And this protects both of our interests.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.100]   Think about this.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:28.780]   If I'm disabled but I'm receiving an income from the business, how much – and I'm
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.020]   not working but I'm still receiving 50 percent of the profits.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.940]   How much do I want to be out of the business?
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.060]   I'm doing pretty good.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.060]   I'm not working.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.900]   I'm still receiving 50 percent of the profits.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.500]   I don't want to get rid of my business.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.340]   I like this.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.580]   But if I'm disabled and I'm not contributing anymore to the growth of the business and
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:53.180]   you're picking up all my slack at work, how much do you want to get me out of the
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.180]   business?
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.300]   Well, financially, you probably want to get me out so you can bring someone else in.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.900]   Maybe you're going to find someone who's going to fill my role.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.420]   But you don't want to get me out too much because you know what an impact it's going
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   to make in my life.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.620]   After all, we're business partners.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.500]   You care about me.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   And so it can become very difficult for partners to figure out, "Are you disabled or are
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.500]   you not disabled?
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.700]   What do we do?"
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:21.220]   The second big thing that it comes into is how do we determine if you're actually disabled?
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:26.260]   We set up this legal document between us that's called a buy-sell agreement that triggers
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   that when you're disabled, you're going to be out and I'm going to buy you out.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.380]   But how do we know when that's going to happen?
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.420]   And worse yet, who enforces that?
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.100]   So the buy-sell agreement could say, "Well, if Josh was disabled, you got to buy him out.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.740]   You may not have the money.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.500]   And how am I going to prove that I'm disabled?"
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.740]   It can be very, very difficult.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.760]   So if you're going to have this kind of policy, this kind of agreement in your buy-sell agreement,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.700]   you should try to get disability insurance for it.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:56.340]   And if you can get disability insurance for it, you should make the terms of your legal
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:01.580]   agreement subject to the terms of your insurance contract.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.960]   So you want the contract to come in and to say, "If Josh was disabled according to this
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:12.720]   disability contract number 12345, then this clause goes into force."
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.460]   And this accomplishes what you need.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:20.660]   It accomplishes an external third-party independent who's determining the level of disability
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.420]   and it's making sure that we don't have a legal agreement that says one thing and an
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.060]   insurance agreement that says another.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.580]   Because the legal agreement says I'm disabled, but the insurance agreement doesn't pay out.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.500]   Now you've got no money to pay me.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.420]   So you make the terms of your legal agreement between you subject to the insurance policy.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.920]   And then that way, you have that insurance policy.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.060]   If it triggers, now you have the money to buy out.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.340]   You don't want to get in the situation where the legal document triggers the sale, but
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.720]   the insurance policy is not triggered because then you don't have any money.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.940]   So an disability buyout insurance policy is very, very useful.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.820]   I've done these with architects, attorneys.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.940]   You just want to look at it.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.140]   And if you're in practice with somebody, think about how this works.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.580]   And it can work really well to have this set up.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:12.140]   It protects for many people the equity of their practice.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.860]   It's difficult in a professional practice and that's where these are largely used.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.340]   Because if you have a traditional business, a brick and mortar business, a business that
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:26.280]   can operate independently of the business partners, oftentimes those businesses can
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   keep going.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.540]   Just ask yourself, if I were disabled, how would my business be affected?
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.980]   But if you get into a professional occupation, an attorney, an architect, if I were disabled,
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.700]   that's going to dramatically affect my firm.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.660]   And yet the value of the firm, the equity, the reputation that you've built, that's a
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.660]   big asset.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.420]   It's a hard asset to cash out of.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.780]   So older professionals try to cash out by bringing in younger partners and doing a buyout
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.780]   over time.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.880]   So there's a good transition plan and that can work really well.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.420]   But you need to consider and research these buy-sell plans.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.220]   Okay, a couple more.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:07.820]   There are some unique things you can sometimes get, impaired risk disability policies.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.740]   You can get policies for unique occupations.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.620]   You can get disability policies for athletes.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.860]   You can get disability policies for entertainers.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   These are not going to be gotten with a mainstream company, but they can be gotten.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.180]   These will need to be individually underwritten.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.460]   I placed a couple of these policies with a subsidiary of Lloyd's of London.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.340]   That's where these types of insurance contracts often go where they – I'm going to insure
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.020]   my legs and these actresses.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.680]   I'm going to insure my lips in case my lips get damaged.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.020]   My pouty lips are my reputation.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:49.620]   But I had – I worked with one lady who was a TV correspondent and she was an independent
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.820]   freelance TV correspondent.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.220]   We couldn't get her disability insurance with a mainstream company because they wouldn't
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.700]   cover that occupation.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:48:01.620]   But I could – I did get it with Lloyd's of London with a subsidiary of them.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.580]   These are also the companies that you work with if you need a high-excess limit policy.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.100]   So you reach – you have an occupant, a very high earner.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.940]   They want to protect their income.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:18.460]   You can go ahead and you can get in place a policy with a mainstream company, but they're
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.460]   going to limit their risk.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.920]   They're going to stop at 10 or 15.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.280]   Some of them will go for $25,000 a month.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.860]   But you can go ahead and get an additional supplemental policy for a much higher amount
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   with another company.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.660]   So these options out there exist.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.660]   They exist.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.900]   If you're in a market like a physician, there's physician excess limits policies
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.660]   where they'll go above the $10,000.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.860]   The terms work a little bit different.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.020]   But those are – if you're a physician, those are widely available.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:48.380]   If you're in a more unique, smaller occupation, they're less available.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:53.860]   There are also products out there such as key person disability insurance.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.260]   So most of you have probably heard the idea or the word of key person life insurance.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:03.100]   Let's say that I run a company and I have my star salesperson who's responsible for
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.260]   bringing in 80 percent of my revenues.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.580]   They're very good.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.580]   They're very well-known.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.900]   I pay them handsomely and they bring in 80 percent of our revenues because they've
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.180]   been in this industry forever.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.300]   Well, that's a key employee for me.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.420]   If that person died, I've got a problem.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.140]   I've got a huge problem as a business owner.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.900]   So I'll put a key person life insurance policy on that key person.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:31.300]   If they die, then I'm going to have a half a million-dollar life insurance policy payout.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:36.100]   That will help me to have enough money coming in to where I can handle the financial shortfall
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.620]   I'm going to have for the next few years until I can raise up another – raise up
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.340]   or train another salesperson.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.340]   Very important.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:48.060]   You can also purchase key person disability insurance and it does the same thing.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.060]   Again, my star salesperson gets cancer.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.820]   We feel really sorry for Joe.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.660]   We try to help Joe as much as we can.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.340]   But at some point in time, we got to figure out what we're going to do.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   If Joe can't service his accounts, we got a problem.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.940]   So you can purchase a key person disability insurance policy that will protect you and
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.420]   remunerate you for the loss of Joe's services.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:17.660]   Finally, you can cover disability – you can get disability and policies to insure
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.820]   a bank loan in the same way that you can get life insurance to satisfy that.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.580]   If I owed you a lot of money, you might want to have a life insurance policy on my life
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.700]   if I die and I can't pay or if I get disabled.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.100]   Then there's also – I've seen a few companies that have worked in the area of
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.860]   divorce settlements.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.860]   Same thing.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:48.700]   If you're reliant on alimony and child support payments and the divorced spouse becomes disabled,
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.200]   that can be a real problem to your alimony and child support payments.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.820]   So you can get a disability policy that can put that in place and you can put in place
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:03.980]   a policy that will – you can make that part of the divorce settlement.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.740]   A good divorce attorney usually handles these things but in general, you often want to make
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:13.660]   sure that there is life insurance and potentially disability insurance that's protecting
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.060]   you in case of the death or disability of your spouse.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.360]   All right.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.940]   That covers most of the things that I wanted to cover here.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.940]   Just the final thing.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.940]   Let's see.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:24.940]   Questions.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.060]   Joshua, I heard one of the podcasts where you mentioned you're going to be doing a
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.900]   series on disability insurance next week.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.380]   I have a couple of questions to contribute.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.140]   Number one, can you get disability income insurance if you don't have a job?
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.180]   I do a variety of things to make money but often on a project basis or just as they come
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.440]   up and sound interesting to me.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.900]   My income isn't very predictable but my expenses are really low.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.880]   So it works fine as long as I'm healthy.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.660]   But it wouldn't if I were hospitalized or indefinitely incapacitated.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.840]   Answer to this question is probably not.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.220]   Possibly but probably not.
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:01.980]   Now, depending on how you have these things structured in terms of your personal activities,
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.540]   that will drive the answer.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.820]   When you say I do a variety of things to make money but often on a project basis or just
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:13.340]   as they come up, if that's – I have a couple of different jobs with employers.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.100]   I'm an employee for – let's just make up some occupations here.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:24.500]   I'm a photographer and I work part-time as a photographer and then I also do DJ work
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:31.380]   and I help a DJ as their employee and I'm a rodeo clown and I have a real estate license.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.940]   So I do those four things.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.700]   Well, you're not going to be able to get disability insurance and the reason is because
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:43.460]   in the contracts, you're not going to be able to prove that you do it for enough time.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.460]   There are limits.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.460]   I forget what the limits are.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.460]   I think something like 10 hours.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.100]   You got to be working at least 15, 10, 15, 20 hours a week in an occupation for it to
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.380]   be considered.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.740]   So if you're just doing eight hours as a photographer and you're getting paid as
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.340]   an employee and eight hours as a DJ and you're getting paid as an employee and you're working
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:06.580]   10 hours but you're doing that on a contract basis in photography and your real estate
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.580]   agents, your commissions are all over the place, you can't get disability insurance
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.580]   for that.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   That's going to be a problem.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:19.900]   Now, if you can bring some of your activities together under one structure and under one
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.620]   entity, then you can make – you might be able to get this done.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.140]   So if I were working as a photographer and as a DJ and – I can't make Rodeo Klon
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:39.060]   work – and a graphic design artist and I brought those together under JJS Enterprises
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:45.860]   and JJS Enterprises is designed to provide graphic design services, audio services, and
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.380]   photography services to the wedding marketplace because I'm designing wedding invitations.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:55.540]   Well, now I've got an occupation that I can bring together under one business entity.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:01.820]   I'm filing one tax return, Schedule C for JJS Enterprises or a corporate tax return
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.140]   and now I've got one entity.
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.820]   Well, now you can go ahead and get disability insurance.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.820]   Yes.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.700]   So hopefully your activities might be something that you can bring together, consolidate them
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.540]   under a business entity, make those activities the services of that entity, and then you
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.500]   can work your way through the business process, the business disability process.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:27.140]   Next, are there any special things to establish now to prove disability in the future?
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.860]   This is the same listener.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.460]   For example, my greatest asset is my mind.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.020]   I can learn and retain new information faster than almost anybody I've ever met.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.060]   If I suffered a blow to the head and lost 50% of my mental function, I would still likely
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.100]   test within the normal range for intelligence and brain function.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.560]   I don't say this to sound conceited.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.220]   My dad had a stroke and had this very thing happen and I'm sharper than he was.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.380]   Is there a reliable way to establish that my baseline isn't average?
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.380]   Some kind of doctor certification, test results of some kind, the same question could apply
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.820]   to any unusual aptitude I think.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:59.220]   It's an interesting question.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.860]   I've never seen that but what I would do is as with anything, any documentation that you
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.720]   can prove or provide is helpful.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:13.940]   So if this aptitude that you've noticed is something that could be medically certified
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:19.420]   and if you could do it in a minimally intrusive way, I wouldn't spend thousands of dollars
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.940]   trying to plan for something that will likely never happen.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.980]   You're probably never going to get disability disabled.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.860]   But if you could just say, "Hey, can we run a cognitive test or you're applying to
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.940]   Mensa and you say, 'Let me see if I can do this' and you can prove that," then
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.940]   that would be good information to have.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.940]   But the reality is that when you are disabled, the way that the insurance company is going
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:45.900]   to calculate the fact of your disability is did you lose, did you suffer the loss of time
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:54.580]   at your occupation, duties at your occupation and/or income depending on your specific contract.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.660]   So that's going to make a difference, time, duties or income.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:07.540]   So you're not going to be considered to be disabled because you had a loss of aptitude.
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:13.420]   If you could still function and do your job, do your work with 50% of your current mental
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.340]   functioning, you're not going to be considered to be disabled.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:22.020]   But if your mental functioning is going to influence your job, then the doctor would
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.500]   certify that and you would be considered to be disabled.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.440]   The company here does make a difference.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.460]   Some companies and I cannot name any specific companies.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:35.540]   I would just encourage you to do research on companies.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.860]   I think – and I actually can't prove this.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.740]   So let me be careful with what I say.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.300]   I think the nature of the company makes a difference.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:51.660]   I think there are insurance companies that are looking to cut anything they can and there
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.140]   are insurance companies that are looking to provide good service.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.900]   No insurance company is going to be trying to pay out a fraudulent claim.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.380]   But there does make a difference of the insurance company.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:09.700]   I feel like one of the things if possible is to work with a mutual insurance company.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.540]   I've experienced this with USAA.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:17.820]   As a USAA policy owner, when I've had to make insurance claims, I had accidents a couple
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.500]   of times I had to make insurance claims.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.860]   USAA was fantastic and I felt like I was treated fairly.
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:28.580]   I read some of the experiences of some other people with other companies that are not mutual
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:33.340]   insurance companies like USAA and it makes a difference.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.500]   For years I worked with Northwestern Mutual and I was always very proud of Northwestern
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   Mutual.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.260]   They always look to try to – they seem to try to always look to do the right thing.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.620]   Now there's going to be disgruntled policy owners with any company.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.860]   But I feel like that mutual versus stock company thing does make a difference and I think you
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.660]   want to work with a reputable company.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.300]   It doesn't make sense to me to always just work with the cheapest company out there because
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   now when you need service, when you need them to pay the claim, it might not work out.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:07.380]   So some companies build their reputation on their taking care of their customers.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.780]   I think American Express has worked hard in this area as well.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.420]   If you've got a problem, they're going to try to take care of it.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   So choose your company carefully.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.820]   I've got a few more questions here.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.940]   Let's just buzz through them.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:21.260]   Before I go to the next question from a listener, I expected to get this question.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.260]   I haven't covered it yet but many people ask me or have asked me in the past about
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.640]   pregnancy.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:32.780]   Is pregnancy considered a qualifying event to receive on a disability policy?
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:36.780]   This can often happen especially if you're thinking that you're planning to have kids
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.460]   and you want to know.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:44.540]   So the short answer is that yes, pregnancy is considered something that can pay out for
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.540]   disability.
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:49.600]   Generally, it will pay out more for short-term disability than for long-term disability although
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.380]   it can be effective for both.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:59:00.780]   But the key is to recognize that just simply the state of being pregnant is not a disability.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:06.680]   But if you are disabled because of something that's associated to pregnancy or a complication
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.520]   from pregnancy, that qualifies as being disabled.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:18.740]   So in a normal, healthy pregnancy and childbirth, in general, a mom who's recently given birth
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:25.580]   a couple of weeks after childbirth is going without any complications, is completely capable
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.440]   of going back to work.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:33.980]   So medically speaking, a normal childbirth is not going to qualify for a disability benefit
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:39.900]   simply because most moms can do their work up until the day that they – day before
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.020]   or day of that they're going to be giving birth.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:47.500]   A few days of rest, a week or two of rest ideally is going to be best and then they're
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   back at it.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.660]   Well, that's not going to satisfy the elimination period of a disability policy unless it's
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.700]   a very short-term disability policy.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.740]   It's just not going to qualify.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.220]   Just because you're choosing to stay at home and spend the first few months with your
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:07.020]   children and not go back to work doesn't mean that medically you can't go back to
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   work.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.380]   So it's not going to trigger the policy.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:19.180]   However, if there is a complication associated with pregnancy such as, "Hey, I had a friend
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   recently.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.020]   Her water is released in the sixth month of pregnancy.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   OK.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.440]   There are three months of bed rest now."
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.980]   At that point in time, medically she cannot work.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.580]   And so once the elimination period of her contract has been satisfied – that's why
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.260]   I said a short-term is more likely to pay out.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.920]   Once that two weeks or that three months is satisfied, then the policy will start paying
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   benefits just like any other physical disabling condition.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.580]   So pregnancy is covered.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.940]   It's just that most pregnancies don't result in a medical disability.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.860]   So usually you're not going to get a payout just because you had a baby.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   Next question here.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   This one is funny.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.340]   It's a little hard to understand the question but I love the question.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   "Hi, Joshua.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.820]   I've heard your podcast for a while now.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.780]   I thought I should get in touch after hearing your recent podcast related to the importance
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.460]   of buying disability insurance.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:13.260]   I'm interested in how the premiums receivable are calculated for certain disabilities.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.160]   More specifically, what happens if an individual loses certain superpowers?
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.380]   As you may have seen recently, most movies are gradually starting to touch upon these
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.980]   superhumans amongst us.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.460]   I am personally not worried as my superpowers are unlikely to disable anytime but I'm still
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.220]   curious to understand the finer details of these financial transactions."
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220]   Love the question.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:38.220]   Well, the answer is if your superpowers are related to your job and if you lose some of
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:45.300]   your superpowers and that causes you to suffer a loss of time, duties or income at your job,
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.400]   then you've got a problem.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:55.220]   So the question is, do they know about your superpowers and are they going to be cataloged?
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.900]   They know about your super job.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:04.720]   In general, it comes back to that loss of time, duties and/or income depending on the
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.740]   contract how it's written, time, duties and/or income.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:12.340]   If you've suffered loss of those things, then you're generally going to receive a benefit
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.260]   once the terms of the contract have been fulfilled.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.320]   As long as your contract includes a partial disability payment, then it's going to pay
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.020]   you out a partial benefit.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:31.620]   So if you lose some superpower and that causes you to not be able to have a 25% loss of time
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:36.420]   at work, as long as your policy has a partial disability benefit associated with it, then
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.860]   that 25% loss of work will come with a 25% benefit.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.820]   So that's the only way that the amount of money that you receive from a disability policy
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.940]   is going to be affected, is if you're receiving a proportional partial benefit.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:54.400]   Most companies, anywhere from 20% to 80%, you'll receive a proportional benefit based
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.820]   upon the proportion of loss that you've experienced and then a proportion of the face amount of
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.820]   the policy.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.140]   So 50% loss, you have a policy that's $4,000, they're paying you out a 50% benefit, you're
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.660]   going to receive $2,000 a month.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.740]   It's not related to a loss of any one superpower.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.220]   So if you had 10 superpowers and you lost one superpower, but you could still have full
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:24.180]   time at your job, do all the duties of your job and earn as much income, just because
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.780]   you lost one superpower out of 10 doesn't mean you're going to qualify as being disabled.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.780]   Next question.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   Kevin says, "Hey, Josh.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.340]   I love the series on disability insurance.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.340]   Very helpful.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.580]   I wanted to ask you a fairly general question about planning disability insurance.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.620]   I'm a physician.
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.740]   It seems like there are quite a few physicians that listen to your show.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.180]   By the way, thank you all the physicians that listen to the show.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.780]   Feel free to correct me on all my medical ignorance.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:50.440]   And I've recently had to tell one of my patients that she has an incurable, progressively blinding
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.980]   condition that will most likely leave her unable to work in several years.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:59.300]   She is still quite young, in the middle of her career, and I hated giving this devastating
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.300]   news.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:04.140]   She is but one of many people I take care of who face similar problems.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   Obviously, as someone who does not know the ins and outs of insurance, I can only direct
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:12.060]   them where they should go, but I want to be able to give them at least some helpful guidance
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.700]   as they deal with a major change to their lives.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.460]   I deal with quite a few people trying to apply for Social Security disability, and I have
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.460]   a similar view as you do.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:24.980]   People who need it can't get it, and it's generally not enough for any meaningful subsistence.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:30.380]   My question is, what options are there for someone who is just diagnosed with a permanently
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:35.220]   disabling condition, either presently or something that almost universally is disabling in the
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.600]   future, for securing disability insurance?
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.260]   If there is anything, thank you for everything you do, Kevin.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.140]   Kevin, unfortunately, the answer is there's no option.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:47.220]   There's really not an option for disability insurance.
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:52.700]   Anytime your medical situation shows a hint of change, basically, most of your insurance
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.860]   options are going to be tossed out the window.
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.140]   Insurance companies are not in the business of losing money, and so they're not in the
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.300]   business of taking sick people.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.700]   The way that an insurance company works well is if they have their rates, and their rates
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.060]   can be applicable across the board, and they know that they're doing good underwriting.
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.760]   Now, there are always exceptions.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.080]   You may apply for insurance and the next day be diagnosed, but once there's been a diagnosis,
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.280]   your options for insurance are very, very limited.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.360]   They're just practically non-existent.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:32.700]   Again, insurance companies don't like things that are in flux.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.160]   Even if something weren't going to result in a permanently disabling condition, even
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:42.040]   if it weren't almost assuredly going to result in blindness, even if something's in flux,
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.400]   all of a sudden things become difficult.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.000]   When you buy insurance, insurance is not a right.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.160]   You have to ask and be accepted in the contract.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:01.600]   What's interesting, as an insurance agent, I've been through this many times, clients'
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.760]   attitudes change.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.520]   Insurance has to be sold a little bit, sold kind of aggressively in the sense that I've
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520]   got to make the case.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.640]   That's why I started this series with selling you insurance, talking about the impact, trying
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   to evoke in you sales.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.800]   I'm trying to invoke in you an eager want for the product.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.280]   I want you to want it.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   That's selling.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   I've got to transfer the enthusiasm that I have for the ownership of disability insurance
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   to you.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.360]   First, they've got to be sold.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.040]   Many people come into a disability insurance discussion, just like many of you who are
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.560]   listening and they're not that interested.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.840]   They don't really want it.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.040]   Then the insurance agent sells them on the idea.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.880]   Then we take it to underwriting.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.160]   What happens is that if we get any problems in underwriting as an insurance agent, it's
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   funny because your client that wasn't sure that they were even going to accept the policy,
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.960]   they think they want to apply, they're going to think about it, okay, let's go ahead and
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.600]   make an application, buy the coverage.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.560]   They're thinking about all of a sudden they get very offended because it's kind of offensive
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:05.320]   to clients when the underwriter says, "Well, you're not quite our top choice."
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.640]   It changes the attitude.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.720]   It's just always – I've always chuckled a little bit where I would have somebody who
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.920]   didn't want insurance.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   I showed up.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   They said they didn't want insurance.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.240]   I asked them good questions.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.360]   I opened their minds to the value of insurance.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.000]   We went ahead and submitted an application.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.760]   Then all of a sudden, they're angry with me that the insurance company doesn't want
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760]   them.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.720]   They're offended.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   So there's no disability solution that I know of.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:36.000]   But that doesn't mean however that there can't be a solution that can be found.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.720]   This is why I do radical personal finance, to demonstrate that financial tools such as
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.640]   insurance can be helpful and can be useful but there are other tools available as well.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.600]   If I wanted a plan for the future of my family and I couldn't get life insurance, I could
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.480]   make a plan to make sure that my family is OK if I can't get life insurance.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.200]   I should do a show on that sometime.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.520]   You can solve that problem without life insurance.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   How do you solve it?
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.880]   Well, I just remember so clearly a family that we used to know.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.080]   They built a cabin up in the mountains.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.080]   They had lots of kids.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.440]   The dad was sick.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.520]   But when he died, he had an active family-operated business.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   They had no debt.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.080]   They had a paid-for cabin, paid-for land in the mountains.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.840]   The children were well-trained and were contributing to the business.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.780]   So when dad died, the family was able to keep things going.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.780]   He made a plan.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.280]   He was prudent and he cared for his family even without buying life insurance.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   Same thing with disability.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.560]   Now this particular person, blindness doesn't necessarily mean that they're completely going
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.400]   to be unable to do anything.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.840]   You can earn an income doing something that's blind, even if you're blind.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.920]   I could do my job with some changes but I could do my job now that I do with blindness.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.880]   So the biggest opportunity for someone in that situation is – it's not going to happen
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.760]   probably with you as the doctor.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.080]   It's not going to happen in the stress of the moment.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.840]   But the biggest opportunity is let some time go.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:06.880]   Let the emotions die down and then you make a new plan based upon the new constraints.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.040]   You say, "How can we take this problem and turn it into a solution?"
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.860]   Take the problem, turn it into a solution.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.720]   Figure out, "OK, this is a constraint."
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.480]   It doesn't mean that if you've got an income, if you're a truck driver and you're going
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.140]   to go blind, you're not going to be a truck driver anymore.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.600]   But that doesn't mean you can't build new skills, new capacities for something that
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.800]   can be done even though you are blind.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.160]   So that's the best solution for people in this situation.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.280]   Probably not going to come from you, Kevin, just because you're a physician.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.400]   But maybe you can encourage them that there are lots of people who have faced very difficult
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   circumstances, including their own circumstance, and they'll be able to find a solution in
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   time.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   All right.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.680]   I think that is – just look at the rest of the questions.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.480]   I think that's all the questions that I want to take today.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.580]   I hope this series has been useful to you all.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.780]   I hope you've enjoyed it, a little bit of inside look and a little bit more knowledgeable.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:02.540]   If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer questions on a Friday Q&A call or
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.540]   I'd be happy to answer questions.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.860]   You can send them by email.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.860]   Sometimes they get in.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.160]   Sometimes they don't.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.380]   But I hope this has been useful to educate you and help you to feel a little bit more
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.380]   confident.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.380]   That's my hope.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.140]   My hope is to give you some more information and help you to feel more competent.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.020]   I always used to love the Sims model.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.420]   Si Sims had the discount clothing store.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:26.340]   An educated consumer is our best customer was their store model.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.540]   I think they're out of business now.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:36.420]   But I always loved that model and an educated financial consumer is the best client for
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.220]   a good financial advisor, for a good insurance agent, et cetera.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.820]   So I hope that – I mean I hope even just this insight in disability insurance.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.020]   Insurance agents, they do a lot of work.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.780]   It can be very, very valuable.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.900]   I don't think that you need insurance agents in everything.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.660]   Sometimes it works great to go right to the company.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:57.500]   But I mean hopefully some of this inside knowledge that I've shared with you, knowing what
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.340]   company to go and present your case to, knowing how to package the case, knowing which company
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:07.020]   is the best, that's why it's good to find an insurance agent that you can trust.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.700]   I feel one of the concerns that I have going forward is that the – for the financial
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:18.020]   planning industry is that the role of the insurance agent seems to be quickly falling
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.700]   to the wayside.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:24.780]   Most young financial services professionals are interested in going to the investment
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.780]   side of the business.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.260]   Man, a good insurance agent is really, really valuable.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.260]   I don't see those ranks being filled.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.260]   But not my problem.
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.220]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.260]   If you'd like to support the show, I would be grateful to you for doing it.
