[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   I want to talk a little bit about your guys' thought process with me coming into the league.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.340]   Obviously you were both from Columbia so you had known about me and things like that, but
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.840]   I had been through a lot.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.440]   The Clippers doctor spread the report throughout the league that they didn't know, they weren't
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.520]   sure if I'd be able to play basketball considering my injuries, and a lot of teams were scared
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   away by that.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.160]   I remember the first time I got on the phone with the Nuggets was with Tim Conley on the
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   day of the draft because my agent wanted to kind of create a floor, like okay, if he drops
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.360]   it here, this team will take him.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.840]   So I had no idea going into the draft what was going to happen.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.960]   What were those conversations like behind doors about me?
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.760]   My Michael Porter Jr. story first starts, I think you were in 7th or 8th grade, a friend
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.480]   of mine sent me this link of some unknown skinny kid going up for a dunk.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680]   And I was like wow, this kid's supposedly the best 8th grader in the country.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.200]   And I was like wow, I've never seen an 8th grader look at the rim almost like you were.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.880]   And then I was like, wait a minute, that's Jeff City's gym, that's Jefferson City.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200]   I know that gym, we're my high school rivals.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so I did a quick search to try to find out more of what I was watching and I was
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.200]   quickly told that Central Missouri had one of the best players in the country.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.840]   Because I was like, that section of the country doesn't produce talent like you.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.480]   And so I was very aware of who you were from an early age and I followed your career because
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.640]   I was kind of proud that we had someone of your caliber coming out of that section of
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   the state.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.480]   So I followed your career and then I was going to watch your first game at Mizzou and then
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.680]   I heard about what had happened.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.480]   And I think you were going through warm-ups, right?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.240]   There was a couple days leading up to it where you had some tightness, right?
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   Yeah, the injury.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   Yeah, it happened a few days prior but that was my first time experiencing anything strange
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   so I thought it would just dissipate and it got worse and the first game comes around.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.520]   Yeah, and you were going through warm-ups and then I think you had to play, what, the
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.320]   first ten seconds before they, it was so close to game time, they had already turned in the
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   lineup, right?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   It was so close to game time, they had already put the lineup up.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.480]   So I go to my dad and I'm like, "Dad, I don't think I can play, like I don't know what's
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.640]   going on but I can't jump right, like I can't produce force like I want to."
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.920]   And then we went to the coaches and they were like, "Okay, you just have to start the game
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.800]   because big national TV game, you know, number one player in the country going to the University
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680]   of Missouri, you know, which never happens."
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.000]   And then so, yeah, I had to play the first ten seconds and came out.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   And then I followed, you know, I followed what was going on and I knew you came, you
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.640]   were really rushing to get back because you wanted to help your team and, you know, that
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520]   told me a lot about your character.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.440]   You know, if you were already thinking about the pros, which is a natural thing, you know,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.200]   I think that there's probably part of you that wants to think ultra long-term in that
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   scenario.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.080]   I'm sure there was people around you but it also told me that there was a person inside
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.600]   of you, inside of that player that was really competitive and wanted to get out there and
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.680]   you wanted to help your teammates.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.120]   And so, you know, as I watched that spring kind of evolve and I heard about your draft
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.400]   workouts leading into that week, I thought your floor in the draft, I think Chicago had
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.140]   seven, seven or eight, but I also knew that when you were healthy, you were probably the
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.960]   best if not one of the top two or three players in that draft.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.840]   And we had just missed the playoffs by one game that year and we were thinking that we
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.320]   were, once we made it back to the playoffs, we knew we weren't going backwards.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   We had a good young team and we just had a few things that we needed to, we thought to
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   really put us in a new level and so the day of the draft, I remember coming over and Tim
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.520]   had called me the night before the draft and he goes, "Hey, I'm just going to put something
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   on your radar."
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   I was like, "What's up?"
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.840]   Because by missing the playoffs by one game, we picked 14 in the lottery.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.520]   And so Tim called me, he's like, "Hey, I want to put something on your radar."
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   And I'm like, "What's up?"
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   And he goes, "I heard something from a buddy of mine that Chicago might pass."
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.800]   And I'm like, "But I thought you told me earlier today that that was Michael's floor."
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   And he goes, "I don't know.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   I don't know what happened.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   I'm still trying to gather the information.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.200]   I'll talk to you about it in the morning."
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.360]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.140]   And so I came in the day of the draft and Tim Arturas and I sit down and they said that
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.720]   you may have had a spasm or something, like I had a workout and it might have scared a
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   few teams.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   And I was like, "Really?"
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.480]   I was like, "This is just, can we get more data on it?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   Is there any kind of..."
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.000]   And they're like, "We're still trying to piece it together, but he could fall."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   And I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.680]   And I was like, "Guys, that skill set does not grow on trees."
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.520]   And they're like, "Well, the teams could get scared of the back."
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.920]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.200]   And so then I rang my dad and he came down that afternoon.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   And then the four of us, Arturas, Tim, myself, my dad, and we pulled Coach Malone in as well.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.880]   We said, "Look, if he's there, we're going to take him."
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.640]   And we got all our doctors in.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.360]   And it was a really great group experience because we all had to put our heads together
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360]   from our own perspective.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.680]   Tim and Arturas knew that they believed in your skill set and your talent.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.200]   And then you had Coach Malone who was understanding that this is something that was going to play
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.920]   out over multiple years, whereas a lot of coaches, and this is their job, coaches have
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.200]   one responsibility, that's to win the next game.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   And so you have to put, and then our perspective is even further, it's how can we create the
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   best talent over time?
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.640]   And so when your name was still there, it was a no-brainer for us.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.400]   It might sound funny to some people, but I was really worried that, you referenced a
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.040]   team that had two picks ahead of us, and I thought somebody might take a chance.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   Somebody's got to take a chance.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.320]   And I think they may have if it wasn't for their doctor that was doing the main analysis
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.600]   on me that day.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   And so our decision in the room that day, when we all kind of walked out after discussing
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.640]   the different concerns and thoughts from all of our own perspectives, was we'll never have
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.040]   a chance to draft another player like you, especially at that point in time with the
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.620]   group of players that we had, the skill set that you brought, and you could raise our
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.080]   ceiling immensely.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.200]   But we knew it wasn't going to be right away.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.600]   And so we had to, once we drafted you, we got you in, we let our doctors take a look
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.760]   at you, we made sure that you felt like one of the family, and we knew that there was
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   going to be a long journey ahead.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.000]   And I think you may have known, but looking back, you maybe didn't even realize what you
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.060]   were going to have to go through.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.660]   And so you had another surgery, we sat you out that whole first year, we tried to make
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.360]   you feel like you were part of the group, hopefully you did, even though you weren't
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.960]   getting to play.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   But I remember coming over to training camp that first year when, I don't even think you
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.680]   could play, all you could do is just do standstill shooting.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.880]   And our shooting coach at the time was, was it Mark Price?
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   Mark Price.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   Yeah, Mark Price.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   See, I remember.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.320]   And Mark and I were standing there, and I was like, "Mark, what do you think of our
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320]   group?"
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.560]   And he goes, "Wow, there's some really good young players."
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.840]   And that was when he started to ask about Nicola, and Nicola was just starting to really
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.880]   show the level that he could dominate.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   And I was like, "What do you think?"
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.760]   And he goes, "I think you've got a really great, great group here."
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   He goes, "But I'll tell you what."
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.440]   He goes, "Best shooter in this gym can't play right now."
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   And I was like, "You're talking about Michael, right?"
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   And he goes, "Yep."
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   He goes, "I'm talking about Michael."
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.560]   He goes, "Take your time with him.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   Be patient."
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.040]   But he goes, "That guy's the best shooter in this gym."
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.600]   And I said, "Well, that's our plan."
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.120]   And so, over the course of that year, and then I think your first full season was the
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120]   COVID year, right?
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   Is that right?
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.480]   My first full season was the first half of the season, and then we go to the bubble.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.320]   And so, I saw an important step out of you, which was over the first, I don't know, six
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.920]   months of the season, I think you were up and down as any rookie is going to be.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.960]   You're learning how to play.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.920]   You're learning where you fit in the different roles, and you're learning how to play with
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.800]   some of these guys around you.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.400]   And then the season stops, like right around this time four years ago.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.240]   COVID hits.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   We go into our cocoons, and then we emerge in the bubble a few months later.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.840]   And you went from a rookie to a second year player in that little two month span.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   In that gap.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.400]   And so, when you came into that bubble, I saw a different Michael.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.880]   I saw a more confident Michael.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.840]   I saw one that knew how to fit within our team, but also went to really use your own
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.160]   skill set to drive us forward.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.200]   And I remember you hitting some big shots in the bubble, and seeing our team really
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.280]   start to believe in each other.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.200]   And I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   But then you come out of that, and it's kind of a very short off-season.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.800]   We lose Jeremy.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.760]   We replace him with Aaron, and then Jamal gets hurt.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   And so I knew there was a special group in there, and then you have to wait almost two
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.080]   years.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.440]   And that required a lot of patience on our end.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.560]   And we never even remotely thought about veering off the path of the roster that we had.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440]   And now that we got everybody healthy, I could see that you guys last fall, there was a little
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.120]   bit of a period where you kind of had to play your way into it again.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.960]   Jamal had to play his way into it again, gain that confidence in your body.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   And then by March, I could tell we were locked in, and then we were just ready for the playoffs.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   And then it was like, okay, let's be healthy come April and see where the chips fall.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   And I was really proud of the way that you guys just immediately locked in to go 16-4
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.400]   against the NBA's best shot.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.720]   That's not something that a lot of people can say.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   Well, man.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.440]   I mean, man to man, I appreciate you guys so much taking the chance on me.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   I appreciate you, man.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.680]   I remember I said at draft night I was going to do whatever I could to be one of the best
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.080]   draft picks that you guys could ever draft.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.200]   And still, I've been through a lot, but like you saw at Mizzou, giving up and giving in
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.040]   to whatever injuries, that's not part of my DNA.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.080]   But I'm so happy to be a Nugget, you know what I mean?
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   People ask me all the time about that whole draft situation, and I'm like, God does work
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.840]   in mysterious ways, because it's a blessing that somehow I fell to 14, to a team that
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.920]   was already winning, so I got to take my time and not rush back after the injury.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.440]   And now we've just built this program, this championship level program, from really the
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.560]   ground up, with adding small pieces, and we got it continued rolling with the young guys
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   we got now.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.920]   Peyton, CB, I know Julian's not playing right now, but Julian, some of the guards we got.
