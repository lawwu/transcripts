[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   I want to talk a little bit about your guys' thought process with me coming into the league.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.320]   Obviously you were both from Columbia, so you had known about me and things like that,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840]   but I had been through a lot.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.440]   The Clippers doctor spread the report throughout the league that they didn't know, they weren't
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.520]   sure if I'd be able to play basketball considering my injuries, and a lot of teams were scared
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   away by that.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.160]   I remember the first time I got on the phone with the Nuggets was with Tim Conley on the
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.640]   day of the draft because my agent wanted to kind of create a floor like, "Okay, if he
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.340]   drops it here, this team will take him."
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.820]   So I had no idea going into the draft what was going to happen.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.920]   What were those conversations like behind doors about me?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.400]   My Michael Porter Jr. story first starts, I think you were in 7th or 8th grade.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.600]   A friend of mine sent me this link of some unknown skinny kid going up for a dunk.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.720]   I was like, "Wow, this kid is supposedly the best 8th grader in the country."
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.240]   I was like, "Wow, I've never seen an 8th grader look at the rim almost like you were."
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.840]   Then I was like, "Wait a minute, that's Jeff City's gym, that's Jefferson City.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.320]   I know that gym, we're my high school rivals."
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.760]   So I did a quick search to try to find out more of what I was watching.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.200]   I was quickly told that Central Missouri had one of the best players in the country.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.000]   I was like, "That section of the country doesn't produce talent like you."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.560]   I was very aware of who you were from an early age.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.240]   I followed your career because I was kind of proud that we had someone of your caliber
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.200]   coming out of that section of the state.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.480]   I followed your career and then I was going to watch your first game at Mizzou.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   Then I heard about what had happened.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400]   I think you were going through warm-ups, right?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.160]   There was a couple of days leading up to it where you had some tightness, right?
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   Yeah, the injury.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.240]   It happened a few days prior, but that was my first time experiencing anything strange,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.280]   so I thought it would just dissipate and it got worse.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   First game comes around.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   Yeah, and you were going through warm-ups and I think you had to play the first 10 seconds
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   before they ... It was so close to game time, they'd already turned in the lineup, right?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   It was so close to game time.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   They'd already put the lineup up.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080]   So I go to my dad and I'm like, "Dad, I don't think I can play.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   I don't know what's going on, but I can't jump right.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.160]   I can't produce force like I want to."
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.920]   Then we went to the coaches and they were like, "Okay, you just have to start the game
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.360]   because a big national TV game, you're the number one player in the country going to
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.640]   the University of Missouri, which never happens."
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.040]   So yeah, I had to play the first 10 seconds and came out.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.220]   Then I followed what was going on and I knew you were really rushing to get back because
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.680]   you wanted to help your team.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800]   That told me a lot about your character.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.840]   If you were already thinking about the pros, which is a natural thing, I think that there's
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   probably part of you that wants to think ultra long-term in that scenario.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   I'm sure there was people around you, but it also told me that there was a person inside
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.360]   of you, inside of that player, that was really competitive, that wanted to get out there
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.000]   and you wanted to help your teammates.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.040]   As I watched that spring evolve and I heard about your draft workouts, leading into that
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   week, I thought your floor in the draft, I think Chicago had seven, seven or eight.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.300]   I also knew that when you were healthy, you were probably the best, if not one of the
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.320]   top two or three players in that draft.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.720]   We had just missed the playoffs by one game that year.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   We were thinking that once we made it back to the playoffs, we knew we weren't going
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   backwards.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.680]   We had a good young team and we just had a few things that we thought to really put us
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.520]   in a new level.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.040]   The day of the draft, I remember coming over and Tim had called me the night before the
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.120]   draft and he goes, "Hey, I'm just going to put something on your radar."
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.800]   I was like, "What's up?"
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   Because by missing the playoffs by one game, we picked 14 in the lottery.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.520]   Tim called me, he's like, "Hey, I want to put something on your radar."
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   I'm like, "What's up?"
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   He goes, "I heard something from a buddy of mine that Chicago might pass."
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840]   I'm like, "I thought you told me earlier today that that was Michael's floor."
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   He goes, "I don't know.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   I don't know what happened.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   I'm still trying to gather the information.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240]   I'll talk to you about it in the morning."
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   I said, "Okay."
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.380]   I came in the day of the draft and Tim Arturas and I sit down and they said that you may
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.360]   have had a spasm or something, like you had a workout and it might have scared a few teams.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   I was like, "Really?"
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.320]   I was like, "Can we get more data on it?"
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.000]   They're like, "We're still trying to piece it together, but he could fall."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.600]   I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.920]   I was like, "Guys, that skill set does not grow on trees."
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   They're like, "Well, the teams could get scared of the back."
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.920]   I said, "Okay."
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.680]   Then I rang my dad.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.360]   He came down that afternoon and then the four of us, Arturas, Tim, myself, my dad, and we
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.800]   pulled Coach Malone in as well.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.240]   We said, "Look, if he's there, we're going to take him."
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.720]   We got all our doctors in.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.520]   It was a really great group experience because we all had to put our heads together from
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   our own perspective.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.760]   Tim and Arturas knew that they believed in your skill set and your talent.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.220]   Then you had Coach Malone who was understanding that this is something that was going to play
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.920]   out over multiple years, whereas a lot of coaches, and this is their job, coaches have
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   one responsibility.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.040]   That's to win the next game.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.920]   You have to put, and then our perspective is even further, it's how can we create the
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.200]   best talent over time.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.640]   When your name was still there, it was a no-brainer for us.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.400]   It might sound funny to some people, but I was really worried that the ... You referenced
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.040]   a team that had two picks ahead of us, and I thought somebody might take a chance.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   Somebody's got to take a chance.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.520]   I think they may have if it wasn't for their doctor that was doing the main analysis on
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.560]   me that day.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.720]   Our decision in the room that day when we all kind of walked out after discussing the
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.640]   different concerns and thoughts from all of our own perspectives was we'll never have
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.040]   a chance to draft another player like you, especially at that point in time with the
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   group of players that we had, the skill set that you brought.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   You could raise our ceiling immensely, but we knew it wasn't going to be right away.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.560]   Once we drafted you, we got you in, we let our doctors take a look at you, we made sure
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.600]   that you felt like one of the family, and we knew that there was going to be a long
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   journey ahead.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.080]   I think you may have known, but looking back, you maybe didn't even realize what you were
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.440]   going to have to go through, and so you had another surgery.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.200]   We sat you out that whole first year.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   We tried to make you feel like you were part of the group.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.900]   Hopefully you did, even though you weren't getting to play, but I remember coming over
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.800]   to training camp that first year when, I don't even think you could play, all you could do
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.200]   was just do stand still shooting.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.720]   Our shooting coach at the time was, was it Mark Price?
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   Mark Price.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   Yeah, Mark Price.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   See, I remember.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.040]   And Mark and I were standing there, and I was like, "Mark, what do you think of our
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   group?"
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.120]   And he goes, "Wow, there's some really good young players."
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.480]   That was when he started to ask about Nicola, and Nicola was just starting to really show
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.840]   the level that he could dominate.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   And I was like, "What do you think?"
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.700]   And he goes, "I think you've got a really great, great group here."
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700]   He goes, "But I'll tell you what."
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.440]   He goes, "Best shooter in this gym can't play right now."
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   And I was like, "You're talking about Michael, right?"
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   And he goes, "Yep."
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   He goes, "I'm talking about Michael."
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.600]   He goes, "Just take your time with him.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   Be patient."
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.040]   But he goes, "That guy's the best shooter in this gym."
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.620]   And I said, "Well, that's our plan."
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.600]   And so over the course of that year, and then I think your first full season was the COVID
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   year, right?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   Is that right?
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.520]   My first full season was the first half of the season, and then we go to the bubble.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.520]   My first full season.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.320]   And so I saw an important step out of you, which was over that first, I don't know, six
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.920]   months of the season, I think you were up and down as any rookie is going to be.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.960]   You're learning how to play.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.900]   You're learning where you fit in the different roles, and you're learning how to play with
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.800]   some of these guys around you.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.240]   And then the season stops, like right around this time four years ago, COVID hits.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   We go into our cocoons, and then we emerge in the bubble a few months later.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.840]   And you went from a rookie to a second year player in that little two month span.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   In that gap.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.400]   And so when you came into that bubble, I saw a different Michael.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.840]   I saw a more confident Michael.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   I saw one that knew how to fit within our team, but also went to really use your own
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.160]   skill set to drive us forward.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.200]   And I remember you hitting some big shots in the bubble, and seeing our team really
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   start to believe in each other, and I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.240]   But then you come out of that, it's kind of a very short off season.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.780]   We lose Jeremy, we replace him with Aaron, and then Jamal gets hurt.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.760]   And so I knew there was a special group in there, and then you have to wait almost two
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.440]   years, and that required a lot of patience on our end.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.560]   And we never even remotely thought about veering off the path of the roster that we had.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440]   And now that we got everybody healthy, I could see that you guys last fall, there was a little
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.120]   bit of a period where you kind of had to play your way into it again.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.960]   Jamal had to play his way into it again, gain that confidence in your body.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   And then by March, I could tell we were locked in, and then we were just ready for the playoffs.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   And then it was like, OK, let's be healthy come April and see where the chips fall.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   And I was really proud of the way that you guys just immediately locked in to go 16-4
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.400]   against the NBA's best shot.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.800]   That's not something that a lot of people can say.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.400]   Well, man, I mean, man to man, I appreciate you guys so much taking the chance on me.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   I appreciate you, man.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.680]   I remember I said at draft night I was going to do whatever I could to be one of the best
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   draft picks that you guys could ever draft.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   And still, I've been through a lot, but like you saw at Mizzou, giving up and giving into
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   whatever injuries, that's not part of my DNA.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.120]   But I'm so happy to be a Nugget, you know what I mean?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.640]   People ask me all the time about that whole draft situation, and I'm like, God does work
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.880]   in mysterious ways, because it's a blessing that somehow I fell to 14, to a team that
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.920]   was already winning, so I got to take my time and not rush back after the injury.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.440]   And now we've just built this program, this championship level program, from really the
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.560]   ground up, with adding small pieces, and we got it continued rolling with the young guys
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   we got now.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   Peyton, CB.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.920]   I know Julian's not playing right now, but Julian, some of the guards we got.
