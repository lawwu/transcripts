[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   We don't talk a lot about money on this show,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.520]   but today I want to touch on the topic.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.520]   Why?
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.560]   Well, if we think about it,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.240]   money can play a critical role
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.760]   when it comes to the goal of cultivating a deep life
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.280]   in our digital distracted world.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.400]   Now, I want to focus here in particular
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.880]   on an idea that comes from my most recent book,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.480]   Slow Productivity.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.240]   In fact, I'm going to even read a little segment
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.860]   from this book and then we're going to analyze it
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.120]   because it's a small concept
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.400]   that I think could have a big impact
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.580]   on how you think about money
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.480]   and its role in crafting a deep life.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.500]   All right, so let's start with the action.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.220]   I'm going to read to you
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.180]   and then we'll figure out what it means.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.460]   All right, so this is coming from my book.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.220]   I am talking here about Paul Jarvis is his name.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.280]   This is a case study.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.000]   All right, Jarvis studied computer science in college,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.300]   but also had a natural feel for visual design.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.460]   During the first internet boom of the 1990s,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.680]   these two skills proved to be the perfect combination
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.500]   for success in the emerging medium of website design.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.840]   Jarvis produced several eye-catching sites on his own,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.760]   which soon led to job offers.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.100]   Look, Jesse, I'm holding up the book so that it's visible.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.020]   They call that marketing.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.260]   For those who are listening, not watching,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.420]   I've realized if I hold the book up,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.140]   you can see it on the camera
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.940]   because I'm a natural marketer.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.220]   Anyways, back to what I'm reading.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.140]   Jarvis produced several eye-catching sites on his own,
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.460]   which soon led to job offers.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460]   Before long, he was a busy web designer
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.860]   living in downtown Vancouver in a quote,
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.300]   "glass cube in the sky," end quote.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.940]   He felt the normal pressure to grow a small business.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.500]   More revenue would mean a better apartment
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100]   and more prestige, but even though his growing skills
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.660]   would support this well-trod professional path,
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.900]   his heart wasn't in it.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.580]   "My wife and I had just had enough of the city,"
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.940]   he recalled in a 2016 interview.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.220]   "We did our time in the rat race
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700]   "and we wanted something different."
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.380]   Recognizing that his freelance design work
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.140]   could be accomplished from any location
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.140]   with an internet connection,
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.940]   they moved to the woods outside Tofino
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.140]   on the Pacific shore of Vancouver Island,
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.300]   so his wife, who is a surfer,
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.620]   could enjoy the sleepy town's famed breaks.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.620]   As they discovered, frugality is easy
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.580]   when you're living in the woods of Vancouver Island
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.340]   as there aren't that many opportunities to spend money.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.780]   When you're remote, there's nobody to do things for you,
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.940]   so you just have to do a lot for yourself, Jarvis explained.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.980]   Freed from the need to increase his income
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.700]   to keep up with city expenses,
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.340]   Jarvis leveraged his growing skills
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.660]   to keep his work responsibilities flexible and contained.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.900]   At first, he focused on freelance design contracts.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.820]   Because he was in demand,
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.140]   he could keep his hourly rate high
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.060]   and his number of projects small.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.100]   Eventually, tired of deadlines and client communication,
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.580]   he explored ways to further transform
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460]   his notable skills and reputation
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.260]   to achieve even more slowness.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.220]   All right, that is the story of Paul Jarvis.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.180]   I wanna pull a key lesson out of here,
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.020]   but first, let's all just get on the same page
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.340]   about the way, on this show and in that book,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.020]   we think about cultivating a deep life.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.620]   My approach is what I call lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.860]   which says instead of just pursuing a grand goal
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.900]   that you hope will make everything better,
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.860]   like make a ton of money,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.580]   break into this particular industry,
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.420]   become really good at this hobby,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.420]   instead of pursuing a singular grand goal,
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.100]   lifestyle-centric planning says you should start
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.620]   by identifying your ideal lifestyle
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.060]   in all of its different elements,
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.540]   what it feels like, what it looks like,
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.780]   what it smells like, what your daily routine is like,
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.100]   where are you, what's it around,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.260]   what's the rhythm of your days,
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.540]   all of the elements of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.500]   You then evaluate different concrete instantiations
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.440]   of this lifestyle, so different concrete ways
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.340]   you might seek a life that has more of these properties
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.820]   of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.300]   You pick one that seems most feasible
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.580]   and you make a plan to work towards it.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.280]   That's lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.580]   Now, when evaluating potential instantiations
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.140]   of your ideal lifestyle, a common metric
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.420]   that people think about is how much
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.860]   would this instantiation, so this particular concrete life,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.980]   how much would it cost?
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.500]   What I wanna argue here, and this is where
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.740]   the Jarvis story is gonna point us,
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.580]   is that asking how much a given instantiation
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.460]   of your ideal lifestyle costs
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.060]   is not quite the right question.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.700]   And the problem here is that it doesn't take into account
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.220]   what's involved in acquiring those needed funds.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.460]   So let me give you an extreme example
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.940]   to try to make this a little bit more clear.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.660]   All right, let's say I'm a professor here in D.C.,
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.540]   and I decide I wanna move to rural Pennsylvania,
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.100]   and I'm gonna homeschool my kids and live on a farm,
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.420]   and right in a barn, and that's what I really wanna do.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.420]   But there's no university there,
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.580]   so maybe my plan is, okay, but I can write from anywhere,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.100]   so I'm gonna be a freelance writer.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.220]   I'll be a freelance writer, and we'll live in the farm
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.140]   and homeschool my kids.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.980]   If I'm just looking directly at the question
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.740]   of how much would this lifestyle cost,
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.180]   this particular instantiation
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.780]   of my ideal lifestyle properties,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.280]   I might be very pleased.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.420]   I'm like, well, this is cheap compared to living in D.C.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.020]   Maybe this is like half the expense of living in D.C.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.400]   But that would be the wrong question,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.980]   because it might turn out to earn that money,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.260]   even though it's like half the money
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.980]   I would need to survive in D.C.,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.740]   because I'm making so much less money
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.740]   doing freelance writing, I might have to work all the time.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.980]   In fact, my working hours might be even larger
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.820]   than they are in D.C. as a professor.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.900]   And so the fact that it's cheaper
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.720]   doesn't necessarily mean that that lifestyle
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.980]   is gonna get closer, that instantiation's gonna get closer
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.820]   to my properties.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.020]   Here's a more realistic example,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.960]   because this is actually based off a real story.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.900]   Imagine you're working, again, you're in D.C.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.460]   and you're working at, let's say, the home office here
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.660]   for a big consulting firm, right?
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.780]   So you're working for one of the big consulting firms
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.620]   here in D.C.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.860]   You get this idea, you have this ideal lifestyle vision
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.540]   that involves more nature and slowness or whatever,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.540]   and maybe what you really wanna do
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.920]   is move to the upper peninsula of Michigan,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.580]   like your family's long had a cabin
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.540]   and you have this whole vision
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.940]   of what you're gonna do up there,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.420]   and you talk to your employer and they're like,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.780]   yeah, that's fine, because if you move over to this group,
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.520]   the clients for this group are all around the country,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.760]   so it doesn't matter where you're based, right?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.280]   So maybe when you're in D.C.,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.840]   you're dealing with political government relations clients
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.680]   and they're all kind of local.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.720]   They're like, you know what, if we move you over
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.120]   to the energy group, these clients are all around,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.340]   you have to be on site anyway,
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.280]   so it doesn't matter where you're based.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.160]   So sure, if you wanna move to the upper peninsula,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.560]   move to the upper peninsula.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.640]   Now again, if you just asked, great,
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.600]   how much does this particular instantiation
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.880]   of my ideal lifestyle cost?
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.200]   You could be led astray.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.100]   'Cause again, almost certainly it will be cheaper
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.860]   to live in the upper peninsula of Michigan
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.500]   than to live in Washington, D.C.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.420]   But the issue with this plan
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.220]   is now you have to travel to all these clients.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.180]   When you live up in the U.P.,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.500]   you're not really close to an airport.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.920]   You're gonna have to take a puddle jumper to Detroit,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.760]   and then from Detroit,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.460]   you're gonna have to take the longer flights,
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.700]   and you're gonna actually be working way more
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.540]   than you were in D.C.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.980]   So the fact that the lifestyle instantiation's
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.580]   actual cost is cheaper,
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.540]   in some sense doesn't matter that much.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.960]   So what's the better metric to use?
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   I'm gonna argue it's what I call hour cost, H-O-U-R, cost.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.740]   What this stands for is how many hours of work per week
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.540]   does a particular lifestyle instantiation require.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.740]   That's actually the financial metric you care about
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.400]   when evaluating these different scenarios.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.460]   When you use the hour cost in our prior examples,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.300]   that's where you see, wait a second,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.340]   I'm moving to the farm in rural Pennsylvania,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.340]   has a really high hour cost.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.580]   So maybe I'm gonna keep looking at other instantiations
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.820]   to get that hour cost down,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.460]   because the whole point of me moving to the farm
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.980]   is to spend more time outside and doing farm things,
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.300]   being with my kids, so I need a lower hour cost.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.720]   You would have the same insight
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.940]   if you evaluate the hour cost of our Michigan example.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.660]   You would say, man, the hour cost of my living,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.580]   if we move up there, is gonna double.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.400]   I'm gonna be on the road all the time.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.980]   What's the point of, again,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.460]   living in a place where I have access
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.740]   to these other things that are important
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.500]   to my ideal lifestyle if I'm gonna have much fewer,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.060]   many fewer minutes to actually take advantage of them?
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.060]   So hour cost is very important.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.620]   Now, it's important beyond, however,
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.180]   just this particular application
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.140]   of making sure that a cheaper place to live
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.200]   doesn't actually make you work just as much, if not more.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.140]   It has a more advanced application,
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.140]   which is what was demonstrated in the story of Paul Jarvis.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.780]   So what Paul Jarvis discovered
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.140]   is that once you started thinking about hour cost,
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.620]   instead of just using this
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.380]   to help evaluate different scenarios for your life,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.460]   it gives you a different way
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.940]   of thinking about your current work.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.460]   And the insight that Paul Jarvis had
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.460]   is that as his skills got better, he had two choices.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:08.920]   The common choice was, I will make more money.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.620]   I'm in more demand.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.820]   I can have a bigger list of clients.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.860]   I can be a more prestigious firm.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.140]   I can make more money.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.700]   But that didn't necessarily, by itself,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.180]   reduce the hour cost of living in Vancouver Island.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.380]   And if anything, it could actually increase the hour cost
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.100]   because maybe he would have to travel more.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.220]   So he said, my other option
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.440]   is I could just charge more money
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.500]   for what I'm already doing.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.980]   I can get to the amount of money required
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.940]   to support this particular instantiation
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.380]   of my ideal lifestyle that I have in mind
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.140]   in Tofino and Vancouver Island.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.760]   I can bring the hour cost of that lifestyle down.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.940]   So instead of making more money,
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.620]   I'm going to work less to make the same money.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.540]   I'm going to drive the hour cost down.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.100]   And you don't think about this dynamic
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.980]   when all you think about is raw revenue, right?
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.460]   When all you think about raw revenue,
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.560]   in the worst case,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.460]   you just begin trying to maximize that number
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.580]   and now you're just in the singular grand goal theory.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.060]   In the best case, you just say, okay,
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.620]   I make enough to support this lifestyle instantiation,
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.860]   so let's go for it,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.300]   but your hour cost might be much higher
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.020]   than it really needed to be.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.900]   Jarvis's lifestyle, which really is cool,
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.620]   and I go on in the book and I detail
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.140]   what it's like on his property and the greenhouses he has
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.680]   and how he doesn't own an alarm clock
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.420]   and what their daily schedule is like,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.940]   what made this instantiation really cool
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.820]   and close to the values that they identified
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.420]   when going through their ideal lifestyle
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.220]   is that he brought the hour cost of this lifestyle down.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.180]   So that is kind of where the magic becomes.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.380]   If you want to bring down the hour cost of your lifestyle,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.300]   you can go somewhere cheaper,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.820]   but that's only half the battle.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.740]   You can also use your skills not to make more money,
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.620]   but to work less for the same money.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.260]   That also drives down hour cost.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.580]   So that's why I think it's a cool metric
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.660]   is because it opens up approaches
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.940]   to thinking about money in the deep life
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.060]   that you might not have otherwise thought about.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.820]   You avoid traps, but you also find new opportunities
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.540]   to build a life that's even cooler
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.740]   than you might have imagined is possible.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.740]   And it doesn't require some grand windfall.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.740]   It doesn't require what I really need
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.900]   is this book I write to become the next "Atomic Habits."
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.500]   And then with the riches I have from that,
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.620]   now I can finally live on an island
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.260]   and work on my gardens and surf
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.100]   and only work a couple hours a day.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.620]   It turns out if you care about hour cost,
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.500]   you find ways of getting those goals
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.460]   that don't require the windfall.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.020]   It's wait, I'm really good now at web development.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.580]   So I'm gonna triple my hourly rate,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.140]   cut my number of clients by a factor of four,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.260]   just have a few clients,
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260]   but I have a really high hourly rate, boom, I'm good.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.380]   So the hour cost metric
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.260]   really gets you to some interesting places.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.140]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.020]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.100]   that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.300]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.060]   "Slow Productivity,
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.980]   "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.700]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.460]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.460]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.500]   I know you're gonna like it, check it out.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.980]   A key point about this,
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.380]   it requires hard work to do any interesting things here.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.420]   This is not a bypass around my maxim from my 2012 book,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.980]   "Become so good they can't ignore you."
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.740]   Bringing down your hour cost is something you can do
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.340]   if you keep getting better.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.460]   It has to do with how you apply your career capital
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.580]   as you get better.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.420]   It's when you make the choice as you get more talented
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.420]   to say, "I don't want more work.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.700]   "I wanna do less work for the same amount of money.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.940]   "I wanna go to three days a week
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.580]   "and get 2/3 of the income."
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.060]   Like it's using your skills to gain leverage.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.220]   You still have to build up skills,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.700]   but it helps you aim your skills in directions
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.940]   that you might not have thought as possible
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.580]   if you were just using standard ways of thinking
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.580]   about money, your job, and your life.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.980]   Now, how does this connect?
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.060]   I like to connect this all back
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.020]   to the general theme of this show,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.780]   which is more technology-centric.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.140]   As we talked about a couple of weeks ago
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.340]   in my Tao of Cal episode,
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.100]   the general unifying principle for this show
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.060]   is to look at ways in which our Paleolithic brain
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.860]   and Neolithic culture conflicts
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.180]   with our modern digital environment
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.740]   and then come up with solutions to those disorders.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.500]   So how does this fit into that general theme?
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.860]   Well, we talked about this a little bit
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.860]   in the Tao of Cal episode.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.940]   One of the big disorders that comes from these mismatches
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.580]   is that as work gets more digital and abstract,
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.500]   so it's just moving information around on a computer screen.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.620]   It's not tangible. It's not connected to a location.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.500]   It's often what you're doing is disconnected
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.020]   even from a particular outcome.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.060]   It's emails and Zoom and PowerPoint slides,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.900]   like this abstract thing we all do.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.140]   And as our time outside of work
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.900]   increasingly gets colonized
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.340]   by algorithmically optimized distraction and diversion
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.100]   delivered through screens,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.700]   life can turn into this relatively dull slurry
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.620]   of just, I don't know, I'm manipulating the digital
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.540]   and being manipulated by the digital
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.260]   until it's time to go to sleep.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.900]   In that circumstance, which is unique,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.020]   or at least superpowered by our current digital conditions,
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.740]   in that circumstance, we've lost track
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.780]   of how to build an intentional life,
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.460]   how to figure out what's important to you
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.780]   and to pursue those.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.380]   We're too distracted. We're too numb.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.780]   Our lives are too abstracted and screen-mediated
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.940]   for us to be good at intentional living.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.820]   So that's why we talk about the deep life here,
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.340]   not just because it's a good thing to do.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.020]   You only get one run, right?
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.460]   You only get one run here on this planet.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.180]   Might as well make it interesting.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.980]   But because it is a direct response,
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.700]   we have to get much more systematic about lifestyle crafting
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.940]   because we've lost all the cues and wisdom
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.900]   that we used to have about how to do that.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.540]   All right, so that's how we can connect things
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.340]   like hour cost and lifestyle-centric planning
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.820]   back to the central theme of this show,
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.020]   which is the disorders of the modern digital environment.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.940]   So there you go.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.220]   Paul Jarvis, from the book I will hold up,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.420]   teaches us about hour cost.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.700]   I'm thinking now, so Jesse,
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.300]   you always discover these things when you write
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.820]   and then you talk about what you write.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.060]   Hour cost kind of sounds like, oh, you are cost.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.780]   You don't necessarily, on paper, it's perfectly clear.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.620]   - Yeah.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.540]   - But when you say it out loud,
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.620]   and I have this issue, like the word minimalism,
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.380]   perfectly clear on paper.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.020]   Actually kind of hard to say without practice, minimalism,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.060]   but hour cost with an H.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.900]   - Yeah.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.340]   - My latest catchy idea.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.380]   - What was the monster book before "Atomic Habits"
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.420]   in the nonfiction?
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.620]   - "The Subtle Art," Mark Manson's book.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.660]   That's even bigger than "Atomic,"
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.460]   though "Atomic" might catch up.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.060]   But I think "Subtle Art of Not Giving a Bleep Word"
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.980]   is, oh, it was like 12 million copies.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.820]   It was insane.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.780]   Yeah, you should see, if you like that book,
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.640]   check out my, I went on Mark's show.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.140]   It's on YouTube.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.620]   Yeah, he's got a cool YouTube show.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.940]   - I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.140]   - Filmed it out there in Santa Monica.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.500]   It's nice out there, Jesse.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.420]   Hanging out in Santa Monica and LA,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.740]   and Rich rolls out in Calabasas,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.840]   and Mark Manson's in Santa Monica.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.860]   Oh God, who else was I doing out there?
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.980]   Anyways, it's nice out there.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.220]   - Your hour cost might go up if you move out there, though,
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.940]   'cause your expenses would go up.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.060]   - I think the hour cost of, yeah, I would have to write,
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.140]   if I do the math, like to live in Mark's house,
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.620]   I think I'd have to write four books a year.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.660]   Is that sustainable?
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.580]   I'm just gonna take the graph on my end.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.300]   Can I just extrapolate that up?
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.540]   If we just do four episodes of this show a week,
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.600]   and I write like four books a year, what's the problem?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   I could live by the beach.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.720]   All right, we got a bunch of cool questions
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.140]   coming up to cover a lot of topics,
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.460]   but first, let's talk about a sponsor.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.180]   I wanna talk about our longtime friends at Shopify.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.900]   Look, nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.940]   This is home of the number one checkout on the planet.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.300]   The not-so-secret of Shopify is that
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.620]   their shop pay technology boost conversions by up to 50%,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.540]   meaning way less carts get abandoned.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.460]   The people I know, I'm gonna say this very clearly,
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.380]   the people I know who sell things,
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.740]   especially people who sell things online,
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.380]   they use Shopify.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.700]   They don't even really think about it.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.740]   It's the best tech.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.020]   It's got the best checkout.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.620]   It's got the most seamless integration.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.460]   It's easy to use.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.360]   It's a professional experience.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.200]   It's safe.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.580]   It's like everything you want, high conversions.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.100]   So if you're selling things, this is a no-brainer.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.700]   I don't even know who the competitor would be
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.220]   that I would even recommend as number two.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.500]   You should just be using Shopify.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.860]   And the cool thing about it is, look,
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.900]   it's known for e-commerce,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.700]   but they have great point-of-sale solutions as well.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.260]   If you're trying to sell something in person,
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.920]   Shopify technology will be there for you as well.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.980]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.180]   that basically everyone I know who sells online uses.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.060]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period of Shopify
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.860]   at Shopify.com/Deep.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.300]   Type that URL all lowercase to get the deal.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.820]   Go to Shopify.com/Deep to upgrade your selling today.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.620]   Shopify.com/Deep.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.980]   I also wanna talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.760]   Mint Mobile allows you to get wireless service
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.600]   for 15 bucks a month when you buy a three-month plan.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.880]   And it is really easy to do this.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.900]   If you talk to people who have made this switch,
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.400]   they'll tell you the hardest part, logistically speaking,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.840]   is actually breaking up with their existing phone company.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.240]   Setting up the new account with Mint Mobile
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.720]   couldn't be easier, no hoops, no BS.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.600]   To get started, you go to MintMobile.com/Deep.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.980]   That's Mint, M-I-N-T, MintMobile.com/Deep.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.680]   There you'll see right now that all three-month plans
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.720]   are only 15 bucks a month, including their unlimited plan.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.200]   All plans come with high-speed data
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.840]   and unlimited talk and text delivered
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.880]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.960]   You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.820]   and bring your phone number
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.000]   along with all your existing contacts.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.920]   Find out how easy it is to switch to Mint Mobile
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.480]   and get three months of premium wireless service
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.920]   for 15 bucks a month.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.300]   I'll tell you one thing I've been recommending to people.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.960]   I have a middle schooler now,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.840]   so we know people with slightly older middle schoolers
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.440]   who want their kids to have some sort of phone
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.920]   so they can reach 'em.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.840]   And I've been saying to people,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.360]   go buy a dumb phone off Amazon.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.880]   Mint Mobile account, 15 bucks a month.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.480]   They can call you or text you in an emergency,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.320]   but they can't look at pornography on YouTube
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.700]   'til their eyes bleed.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.620]   It's the easiest way to get a quick wireless account
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.760]   set up for your kid, or you want a burner phone at home
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.720]   if you leave your kid at home
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.100]   while you go off to a restaurant
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.940]   so they have a way to call
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.280]   because you don't have landlines anymore.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.260]   Mint Mobile is there to get you cheap service.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.440]   To get this new customer offer
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.400]   and your new three-month premium wireless plan
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.480]   for just 15 bucks a month,
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.460]   go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.380]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.680]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.640]   at mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.360]   $45 upfront payment required,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.640]   equivalent to $15 a month.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.440]   New customers on first three-month plan only.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.280]   Speed slower above 40 gigabytes on the unlimited plan.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.200]   Additional taxes, fees, and restrictions apply.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.880]   See Mint Mobile for details.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.760]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.920]   Who do we got first?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.040]   - First question's from Joseph.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.380]   Whenever I try reading a book,
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.360]   within a couple of minutes,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.960]   my mind drifts off to something slightly relevant
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   or completely irrelevant.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.760]   Is experiencing this just part of a process
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.480]   for a person who is cognitively out of shape
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.160]   and trying to cultivate his ability to focus?
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.000]   - Yes.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.760]   You telling me, and I'm quoting you here,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.500]   my mind drifts off to something slightly relevant
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.520]   or completely irrelevant
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.600]   within minutes of starting to read,
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.520]   that's the same, from a cognitive perspective,
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.240]   that's the same as you telling me
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.040]   I get winded when I walk up the stairs.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.080]   I'd be like, yeah, you're out of shape.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.560]   No surprises.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Also, the solution's easy.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.400]   Get in better shape.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.260]   You're gonna have to eat better, you're gonna have to exercise.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.720]   That's all that's going on here, right?
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.640]   You're out of practice with reading
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   and you're doing the cognitive equivalent of smoking
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.800]   by being on your phone all the time.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.640]   So you gotta practice, practice, practice
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.320]   to get better at it.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.100]   There's the obvious things to do.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.140]   The biggest thing you can do
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.180]   is rewire your phone when you're at home.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.040]   Treat your phone like an old-fashioned hardwired landline
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.380]   by plugging it into an adapter
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   in one place in your house when you get home.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.020]   If you need to look something up,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.340]   you go to where your phone is.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.260]   If you need to check your text messages
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.500]   or do a text conversation, you go to where your phone is.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.940]   If you wanna listen to something,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.460]   well, you can put on wireless headphones.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.280]   So like, if you wanna listen to my podcast
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.560]   while you clean the dishes, that's fine.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.400]   Use wireless headphones, but keep the phone wired.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.800]   This means when you're at home,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.940]   it cannot become a default distraction crutch.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.700]   So you're watching TV or you're reading a book
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.820]   and you have that twinge of boredom,
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.820]   it's not there for you to pick up.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.860]   And the friction of getting up and walking to another room
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.020]   and picking it up where it's plugged in,
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.340]   that's too high for you to do that.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.620]   So you overcome that moment.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.060]   And in doing so, every time you overcome that urge
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.580]   and keep doing what you're doing,
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.820]   that's like doing another pushup in the physical space.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.980]   That's like walking another quarter mile.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.300]   It adds up.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.780]   You're gonna get into better shape.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.820]   All right, so rewire your phone.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.660]   That's a big one.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.700]   Two, keep pushing yourself to read books.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.760]   Start with books that you absolutely are fascinated by.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.980]   Right, so whatever that is for you.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.740]   It could be sports nonfiction.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.600]   Like I just read the Agassi memoir, open.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.680]   Yep, that was fun.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.360]   So if you're into like sports nonfiction
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.560]   or like techno thrillers,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.240]   I've read three so far for Thriller December.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.680]   Just dumb, fun, techno thrillers.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.160]   Just don't read "Eruption" by Michael Crichton.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.360]   And Patterson, don't read that one.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.720]   But whatever it is, or maybe it's like romance fiction
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.120]   or business advice books or self-help books
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.840]   like David Goggins, whatever it is,
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.720]   start with books that you love
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.400]   and you're most likely to keep reading
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.520]   because all you're practicing here
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.260]   is just the literal act of keeping your eyes
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.360]   on the page and going.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.680]   So whatever makes that easier is gonna be better.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.020]   You can read Ulysses later.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.680]   Let's just get used to books.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.500]   So read more, but start with stuff that you really like.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   And then spend more time doing thinking walks
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.400]   on a regular basis, go for a walk without a phone.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.440]   You have no choice, but to get used to your own head.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.360]   What's in the world around me?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.720]   What am I thinking about?
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.580]   Having thoughts, exploring thoughts.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.680]   You just get more comfortable
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.580]   in your own interior cognitive space.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.440]   It's gonna make it much easier
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.060]   to tackle hard thoughts later in books, all right?
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.280]   So do those three things, you'll get better.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.320]   It takes time, but you'll get better.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.660]   Rewire your phone, read more books,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.480]   but start with fun ones and do thinking walks.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.720]   You'll get stronger, Joseph.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.820]   - The ghost writer for "The Agassi" was J.R. Moringa, right?
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.940]   He wrote "The Tender Bar."
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.860]   - Oh, really?
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.700]   - Pretty sure.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.500]   He wrote an article about it in "The New Yorker"
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.660]   not too long ago either.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.500]   - Oh, yes.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.460]   But was that the article about,
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.700]   he also, the ghost writer for "Prince Harry's."
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.500]   - Yes. - It's the same guy?
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.320]   Interesting.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.500]   So he's good at capturing emotional realities.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's an interesting book.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.380]   Man, "Agassi" had a-
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.140]   - Did you read "The Tender Bar?"
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.740]   - No, I heard it's great though.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.060]   - That's good, that was a movie too.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.700]   Well, anyways, who do we got next?
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.260]   - Next up is Adam.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.780]   I'm a real estate agent, receive calls, emails,
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.420]   and texts randomly throughout the day.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.020]   The faster I respond, the happier the client.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.540]   What is the best process to be effective in my work
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.280]   if I still need time blocks for non-distracted work?
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.180]   - Real estate is a good case study.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.520]   Funny story about real estate and distraction and deep work.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   When I bought, when we bought our current house in like 2018,
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.200]   we bought our current house in Tacoma Park.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.380]   I remember, because at some point when you're buying a house
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.000]   you have to like disclose assets
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.140]   and like income that's coming in.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.700]   And it's obviously for me that looks different
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.260]   than most people because I make a lot of money
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.620]   from like books.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.780]   So it's not, here's my W-2
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.180]   and here's how much money I make a year.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.040]   It's like, I just got this huge check the other day
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.440]   because it's like the advance payment
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.480]   for like some new book or whatever.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.100]   So my real estate agent figured out,
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.520]   oh, this guy writes books.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.880]   He wrote a book called "Deep Work."
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.460]   After we handed in those financial disclosures,
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.420]   then she began talking to me about how distracted she was
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.020]   with clients always trying to contact her
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.100]   and what her life was like
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.380]   and what it's like being a real estate agent.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.100]   So it was, Adam, I understand.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.060]   I've heard this story before.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.260]   My rule here, my general rule
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.660]   is that clarity trumps accessibility.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.200]   The problem you're solving for your clients
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.140]   is that they encounter something
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.500]   that they need your input on.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.300]   Like, what about this listing?
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.980]   Is this something we should be looking at?
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.580]   Or is this price, I'm thinking our price for the house
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.460]   we're selling is too low.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.460]   Like, you know, you have something
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.200]   that you want their feedback on.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.040]   Because this is outside of like your normal cycle of work,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.860]   it's also something that you're gonna pretty much
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.680]   be keeping track of on your own in your own head
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.300]   until you get an answer back.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.580]   So you kind of would just like an answer right away
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.220]   so you don't have to worry about this anymore.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.260]   But you can solve their problem just as easily
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.460]   if they have clarity about how they're gonna hear back
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.100]   from you and how they're gonna get information.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.420]   And if they have clarity, they know what to expect
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.760]   and you meet those expectations, they'll be just as happy.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.660]   So in the lack of any expectations,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.500]   just get back to me right away
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.420]   because otherwise I don't know how long it's gonna take
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.260]   till I hear from you.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.080]   And what if I forget?
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.920]   And what if I forget?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.760]   Just get back to me right away
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.700]   so I don't have to think about this.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.760]   But imagine instead you have like a really clear,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.080]   very optimistic forward policy where you say,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.860]   I'm here for you.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.700]   Here's my number for texting, in fact,
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.220]   like you have a question, you see a listing,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.060]   you think I should care.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.980]   Send it to me by text, that's even faster.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.020]   Every two hours I clear out my text inbox
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.740]   so you will, I guarantee you'll hear back from me
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.800]   within two hours at the most when you text me.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.940]   That actually solves the same problem
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.460]   because there's clarity about the policy here.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.820]   Your client knows if I send this text,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.460]   like I send this listing to my agent,
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.620]   I can trust I'm gonna hear back from the agent
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.820]   and I'm gonna hear back from the agent really soon, right?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.060]   Like within an hour or so.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.400]   So like really timely, I can let this go.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.700]   I don't have to keep track of this anymore.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.420]   I'm gonna hear from you in like an hour or so, that's fine.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.540]   So if you have clarity,
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.860]   you don't have to be completely accessible.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.780]   And now you've built yourself like a nice system.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.220]   Like yeah, every two hours I sit down
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.540]   and I go through my text messages
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.140]   and I answer them all in one batch and I'm less distracted.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.940]   And in between I can work on the other things I'm doing
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.500]   without having to be distracted.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.260]   And most people end up okay.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.540]   The 5% rule applies here,
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.100]   which says about any policy like this,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.840]   about 5% of people won't like it.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.440]   That is a fair tax to pay for reclaiming your attention.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.300]   For those of you who are not real estate agents,
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.860]   this same thing applies
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.700]   if you have any sort of client situation
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.380]   or even a situation where you're dealing with a boss,
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.820]   people only want you to reply immediately
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.820]   if they have no other structure expectations
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.120]   for when they're gonna hear back.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.820]   With no other structure expectation,
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.500]   it's up to them to keep track of this in their head
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.340]   until they hear from you.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.220]   So they'd rather you be as quick as possible.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.380]   If they have other expectations,
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.260]   oh, I'll hear back at noon.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.020]   This is when they don't do email in the morning.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.420]   They have an office hours that afternoon.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.940]   I can just call them and I know they'll be there
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.060]   and I'll get the answer.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.620]   You're solving their problem of I know what to do with this
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.980]   and I don't have to keep track of it.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.460]   So expectations often trump accessibility
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.720]   or clarity that is often trumps accessibility.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.340]   That would be, actually, that'd be a bad shirt.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.900]   I think if we put that on a shirt.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.140]   - You could make it an acronym.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.620]   It could be like one of your Russian spy acronym.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.700]   - An acronym would be better.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.820]   I think if I put it on a shirt,
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   the problem is accessibility also means,
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.460]   like from disability studies,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.120]   like making more services accessible
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.620]   to a wider range of people.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.660]   So saying like clarity trumps accessibility,
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   it kind of seems like an anti-disability statement
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.580]   or something like that.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.120]   But yeah, acronym.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.220]   See, clarity trumps CTA.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.340]   That means a lot of other things.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.020]   The call to action, I don't know about that.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.840]   CTA all day.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.680]   CTA all day.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.900]   - Next question's from Vishal.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.700]   I'm a knowledge worker and a young father.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.500]   I started my journey with David Allen's
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.820]   Getting Things Done framework
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.620]   and successfully emptied my mind into a digital tool.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.540]   It's working.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.860]   However, I'm having a hard time
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.300]   coming up with quarterly goals
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.180]   as I'm so focused on getting things done week over week.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.820]   How do I think in terms of a quarter
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.180]   as it relates to my personal and professional life?
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.100]   - Well, this can be the danger of getting things done
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.420]   is it feels like it's a totalizing system,
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.520]   like it's an approach to productivity.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.000]   But I often argue that it's just one piece of many
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.580]   that you need to actually fully take control
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.960]   of your time and your obligations and time.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.700]   So what Getting Things Done gives you
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.140]   is this notion of full capture.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.220]   This is its biggest idea.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.540]   It was an idea that David adapted from Dean Atchison,
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.900]   who was a business consultant who Allen knew
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.140]   and had pioneered this idea,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.780]   and then Allen then developed it further
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.620]   into the Getting Things Done methodology.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.940]   Full capture says, and it's correct,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.200]   do not keep track of obligations only in your head.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.920]   If it's only in your head, it's gonna generate stress
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.760]   because your mind worries about forgetting it,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.440]   and it's gonna take up cognitive resources
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.400]   because your mind is so focused on not forgetting it
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.240]   that those are cycles
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.780]   that can't be spent doing something else.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.280]   So everything you need to do needs to exist in a system
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.980]   that your mind trusts,
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.480]   you're gonna check on a regular basis
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.360]   and it won't be forgotten.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.420]   This gives you peace.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.400]   This reduces stress.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.200]   And that, I think, is the brilliance of Allen's system.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.760]   But then Allen goes on and says,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.140]   let me tell you now how to control your attention,
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.320]   which is what you need to do in your day
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.240]   is basically have this list of things you need to do
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.940]   organized by context, like places you might be,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.740]   and then whatever context you're currently in,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.960]   just pull up the list and start executing things.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   And there's this real, he calls it mind-like water,
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.160]   this almost factorization of knowledge work
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.720]   of like you're just cranking widgets,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.400]   executing next task,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.680]   and you don't have to think about anything,
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.480]   just execute, execute, execute.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.600]   It was a way to reduce the stress generated by overload
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.080]   that Allen was correctly pointing out in the early 2000s
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.920]   was becoming a real issue
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.420]   as we had the email revolution
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.100]   and they got much worse with the mobile
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.840]   and then smartphone computing revolution that followed.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.400]   That's not, however, a sufficiently advanced system
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.840]   for controlling your attention.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.160]   So what I argue is you need full capture
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.780]   for all the reasons that David Allen says,
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.160]   but you need to couple this with multi-scale planning.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.240]   So you got to make decisions
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.660]   about what to do with your time at multiple scales.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.120]   What's my goal for the quarter?
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.160]   How does this influence my plan for the week?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.000]   How's that influence my plan for the day?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.440]   How's that influence what I'm doing right now?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.200]   So you have this link of connections that expands in scope
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.720]   so that your actions right now
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.880]   has at least some sort of tangential connection
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.280]   to your bigger picture goals.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.560]   So you need something like time block planning in the day,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   but time block planning has to be supported
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.480]   by a weekly plan that you do every week
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.800]   and that weekly plan has to be informed
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.740]   by your quarterly plan.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.520]   That combined with the full capture of David Allen's system
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.540]   is what I think is table stakes
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.560]   for sort of non-trivial complexity knowledge work today.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.000]   I wish it wasn't the case, by the way.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.080]   I had this conversation with Oliver Berkman.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.000]   I wish it was the case you didn't have to do that
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.240]   in most knowledge work jobs.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   I'm jealous of the fact that him, for example,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.280]   just doing writing full-time
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.040]   doesn't have to plan like that.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.240]   That's probably more natural,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.200]   but in a standard job where you have a desk
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.940]   and an email inbox and more than a few Zoom invites
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.020]   coming at you every day,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.600]   this is sort of table stakes for not losing your sanity
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.720]   and for building career capital.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.660]   So if you're struggling with your quarterly planning,
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.500]   that's just practice.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.680]   What I would argue is what's more important
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.120]   is that you're actually following
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.200]   the framework of multiscale planning
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.700]   is more important than the content of those plans at first.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.680]   That will come if you build some sort of quarterly plan,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.200]   and it really could just be keep up with the big contract
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.420]   I'm working on this quarter, right?
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.720]   It could start simple.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.320]   And then you build an actual weekly plan
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.840]   and look at that quarterly plan when you do so.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.400]   And then you build a daily time block plan
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.120]   and look at your weekly plan when you do so.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.080]   The rhythm of working at multiple scales is what matters.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.800]   Those plans will become more complicated
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.080]   and more meaningful through experience,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.680]   so I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.600]   But if you don't have the full framework in place,
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.000]   it's not gonna work very well.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.420]   If you're running a David Allen system
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.420]   of just churning through next actions
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.100]   based on your context and you're somewhere else,
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.700]   like I wanna write a quarterly plan,
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.860]   there's no connection between those two,
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.260]   and so that's not gonna be as successful.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.460]   So use multiscale planning,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.460]   care about the mechanics at first more than the content,
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.980]   and the content of those plans will improve with experience.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.660]   - I need to look at my quarterly plan more.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.340]   - You should look at it every week, yeah.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.900]   And then we have a big update coming up.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.460]   I mean, I recommend people do an update
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.640]   during the holiday at the end of December
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.040]   'cause you have a week off at least,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.680]   which is a good time to think about the winter quarter.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.460]   So if you're hearing this podcast,
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.220]   you should be planning to do a big update
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.780]   of your winter quarterly plan
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.980]   within a week or so after hearing this.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.500]   - And you have a personal and a professional one, right?
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.700]   - I do, I've been messing around recently
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.700]   with combining them.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.620]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.420]   So I'm doing a big update right now,
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.220]   and in the current edition of the update,
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.080]   so the drafts of my new plans,
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.220]   I'm combining the personal and the professional.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.980]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.100]   Part of the way I, so this is, all right,
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.740]   this is kind of in the weeds.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.260]   I often have, it's like hypertext plans.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.380]   So like in my, I call them strategic plans
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.860]   instead of quarterly plans, but in my strategic plan,
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   there might be a link to another document
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.300]   that elaborates like a piece of it.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.600]   So I was like, as long as I'm doing that,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.540]   I probably should just have one.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.900]   One unified plan.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.060]   Because I can just link to another document
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.020]   if I wanna have more, like a more detailed strategy
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.260]   laid out for like our media empire or something like that.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.980]   So I am thinking about combining them,
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.660]   but yeah, traditionally I've had a personal and professional.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.340]   All right, who've we got next?
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.700]   - Next question's from Sirtak.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.740]   My sole focus has been to work hard
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.340]   and build a career in aviation.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.300]   The idea of achieving more constantly occupies my mind.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.900]   No matter how hard I push myself,
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.500]   I feel like it's never enough.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.700]   - Well, Sirtak, it's a common, it's a common issue.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.740]   And it's an issue that comes out of
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.100]   using as your philosophy or strategy
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.740]   for constructing a good life, the grand goal strategy.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.900]   But the grand goal strategy says
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.700]   you pick something that's important to you,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.420]   you put all of your energy into mastering that thing,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.360]   and in that success, your life will become good.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.820]   That's what's going on now.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.420]   You've implicitly put all of your eggs
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.500]   in the aviation basket.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.620]   And because of that, your mind is like,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.140]   well, this is gonna be the key
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.620]   to us feeling like our life is meaningful,
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.860]   is succeeding in this goal of aviation,
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.340]   then why are we doing anything else?
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   So of course, your attention keeps coming back to this,
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.460]   and you're having a hard time enjoying
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.660]   or being present for anything else,
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.820]   because you have set this up in your mind as the key,
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.700]   the thing you were doing to make your life better.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.460]   What is the contrast, as we talked about in the deep dive,
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.460]   is lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.120]   where you say, what I wanna build is a vision
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.540]   of my ideal lifestyle in all of its elements,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.420]   not just professional, but in all of its elements,
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   what is the general properties of my ideal lifestyle?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.660]   And then you work backwards, asking, how do I get there?
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.860]   And you do that by coming up with different instantiations,
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.300]   like different concrete scenarios
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.340]   that move you closer to that,
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.180]   and you see which of these is most feasible,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.660]   and then you begin pursuing
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.340]   the one you choose very systematically.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.540]   When you do this, almost certainly aviation
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.380]   will be a big part of the instantiation that you care about.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.680]   Is that my phone, Jesse?
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:22.760]   Guys, I gotta take a phone call, so I'll be back.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.200]   Would that reduce the quality of the show
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.400]   if I took phone calls and checked social media
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.720]   in the middle of it?
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.400]   Now, the reason why my phone,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.320]   there's actually a reason why my phone is on.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.880]   I was expecting a call back from my doctor's office
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.080]   about something, and I forgot that I had it.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.880]   I had it with me and on so that I could take that call
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.040]   when it came, then I forgot I had it with me.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.020]   People don't know that in front of me right now
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.760]   is a screen that I've split
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.920]   between it's TikTok and YouTube shorts.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.420]   And the whole time I'm talking to people,
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.740]   I'm just furiously swiping.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.380]   That's where the money is made, watching TikTok videos.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.880]   Now, going back, aviation will probably be a big part
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.660]   of whatever instantiation you hook into
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.140]   because you really like it,
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.260]   there's elements you like of it.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.460]   So probably your lifestyle-centric plan,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.100]   the instantiation you come up with
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.520]   will involve a aviation career.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.680]   But when you look at all of the properties of your lifestyle
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.040]   that might control, for example,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.280]   or influence how that aviation career looks like
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.440]   because of the other properties that are important to you,
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.120]   where in the country are you flying out of,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.040]   what type of flights are you doing?
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.200]   Is it working your way up at one of the big airlines,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.240]   or is it doing some private jets, or is it doing,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.440]   like your navigation of the possibilities,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.460]   even within the world of aviation in your career,
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.000]   will be influenced when you're thinking
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.020]   about the impact of your various paths to that career,
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.260]   their impact on the other properties
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.740]   you care about in your ideal lifestyle.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.180]   So lifestyle-centric planning is the approach.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.080]   Now, once you've done the lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.900]   a couple of things happen.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.580]   A, you're just much more likely to pursue and enjoy
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.300]   the other stuff that's part of that plan right away.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.140]   You're not gonna push the stuff aside
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.580]   that you've just identified as important
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.740]   just to focus on this one thing
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.060]   because they're part of what you want in your life,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.060]   that time with friends, the outdoor hobbies,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.120]   the community leadership, whatever it is.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.400]   Like, well, that's part of my plan,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.120]   so I'm gonna give that attention now.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.680]   It makes no sense for me not to do that
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   just to work on this one thing because this one thing,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.980]   the aviation career, is just part of my bigger vision.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.480]   The other thing it does is it reduces this pressure
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.460]   from I gotta just crush this
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.680]   to I wanna succeed in implementing my plan.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.440]   And what you need to do in aviation
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   to implement the particular instantiation you care about
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.920]   might be challenging but not crazy hard.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.000]   And so you're very comfortable
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.300]   with a reasonable amount of work towards it.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.820]   The final thing you can do is once you know
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.980]   what the particular target you're aiming for in aviation
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.460]   and why is you can care about process.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.460]   Once a quarter when you're doing your quarterly plan,
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.120]   go back and review my process for working on this career,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.380]   like how I'm studying, how I'm training, how I'm trying to,
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.840]   like, how is that going?
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.180]   Just like I advise students do at college
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.220]   where I say my famous advice was to study like Darwin.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.380]   Always go back and evaluate all the things you're doing
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.300]   as part of your academic activities.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.580]   Get rid of the stuff that's not working
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.220]   and prove the stuff that is.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.400]   You evolve your study habits over time.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.700]   Do the same thing with your process.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.060]   Okay, here's a good process that I think
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.220]   is gonna keep me on track for my goals in aviation,
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.560]   which is part of my bigger lifestyle vision.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.860]   Let's try this for a quarter.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.660]   At the end of the quarter, I will evaluate
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.060]   and maybe we'll make some changes.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.420]   Then during the quarter itself, you can just execute.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.340]   Yeah, I'm just focusing.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.500]   I have a process I execute.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.760]   Here's how much time it takes.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.060]   I just trust this is right.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.900]   If it's not right, within a few months,
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.940]   I'll notice that and we'll change it.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.880]   It's not the stakes aren't so high.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.380]   And again, you're able to pay attention
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.280]   to things outside of it.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.220]   So you become more process focused as well.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.740]   Lifestyle-centric planning is really at the key
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:53.300]   of navigating this tightrope that we talked about
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:58.100]   in the in-depth episode, I guess it was last week.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.460]   Man, my time might've been the week before.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.140]   Jesse, when was the in-depth episode with Kendra?
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.220]   Did that come out last week?
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.060]   - Yes.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.620]   - Okay, so last week's in-depth interview episode
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.220]   with Kendra Adachi, we're talking about-
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.760]   - But when they hear this, it's gonna be Monday.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.340]   - So two weeks ago. - So it'll be like 10 days ago.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.380]   - 10 days ago, that's right, that's right.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.780]   10 days ago, the in-depth episode with Kendra Adachi.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.500]   Oh, we have another one of these coming out too.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.900]   I like these in-depth things.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.740]   - Yeah.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.260]   - Yeah, we have another cool interview coming up.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.180]   Anyways, I keep diverting myself
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.540]   because I'm looking at TikTok on my tablet right here.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.340]   We got into this tension between greatness
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.460]   and everything else and the pursuit of greatness
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.020]   and why that can be very motivating,
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.260]   but also the other stuff that matters in life.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.300]   Navigating that tension is critical
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.500]   for cultivating a deep life.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.660]   Lifestyle-centric planning helps you do it.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.580]   Singular grand goal theory doesn't.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.500]   If you say this is all that matters
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.420]   is succeeding in this career,
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.700]   how are you ever gonna do anything else?
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.860]   It's illogical.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.380]   But when getting to this place in this career
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.380]   by this point as part of this overall vision
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.380]   for a lifestyle, you're much more likely to say,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.180]   well, I have a process I trust for getting there.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.340]   And this process says I'm done working now,
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.300]   so let me go to enjoy something else tonight.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.860]   All right, so Sirtak, give lifestyle-centric planning
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.460]   more of a focus in your aspirations.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.780]   And I think you're gonna find,
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.580]   I don't wanna say balance,
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   but you're gonna find something more sustainable.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.500]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.900]   - We have our corner.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.740]   - Ooh, excellent.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.900]   This is where each week we play a question
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.220]   that is related to my book, which I'll hold up
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.180]   'cause I'm an awesome marketer, "Slow Productivity."
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.580]   We call it the "Slow Productivity Corner,"
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.860]   and we do it so that we can play this theme music.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:44.140]   All right, go ahead.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.660]   What's our "Slow Productivity" question of the day?
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.820]   - It comes from Howard.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.620]   I'm a product manager who was laid off in September.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.740]   In light of how many, so many businesses
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.420]   use pseudo productivity to measure work,
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.480]   how do I, as a job seeker, show actual productivity?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.940]   - Well, Howard, that's a good question
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.940]   because it addresses pseudo productivity
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.180]   as introduced in the Globe and Mail's,
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.780]   one of the Globe and Mail's best business books of 2024,
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.220]   "Slow Productivity."
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.180]   I don't know if I'd focus on that
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.080]   as my main accolade I give the book,
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.560]   but I'm trying to give it more accolades.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.280]   Let me, first of all, give a key reminder
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.780]   for the audience who didn't read the book.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.060]   Pseudo productivity is the idea that visible activity
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.340]   is a proxy, a reasonable proxy for useful effort.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.940]   It's what most knowledge work managers
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.740]   actually manage for because it's too difficult
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.780]   to manage in the moment for actual productivity.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.360]   They focus on pseudo productivity.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.540]   The more activity I see you doing, the better.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.020]   And I argue in the first part of the book
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:45.500]   why that became common and why it's actually also a disaster.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.400]   All right, but here's what's important about this question.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.220]   What's happening to Howard now,
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.140]   and Howard, I'm sorry to use you as like a cautionary tale,
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.400]   but what's happening to Howard now
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.000]   is something that you should keep in mind
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.940]   every day of your current knowledge work job.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.840]   You look at what you're actually doing.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.760]   What you should ask is, is what I'm doing right now
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.260]   going to help me get the next job?
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.900]   Because this is the reality of pseudo productivity,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.940]   and it's what makes it sort of insidious.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.520]   In, that's not how you say that, is that how you say that?
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.960]   - Insidious? - That's not right.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.700]   - I was just gonna look it up. (laughs)
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.540]   - I pronounced that, I pronounced that dead wrong.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.020]   - I was literally just about to look it up.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.860]   - I mean, I can spell it.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.600]   Again, I'm a writer, not a speaker.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.620]   That's what makes it dangerous.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.060]   Let's use simple words here, insidious.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.060]   That's not how you say that.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.800]   Well, anyways. - Insidious?
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.480]   - Maybe, insidious?
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.380]   No, oh my God, we're going down a rabbit hole now.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.700]   - We're gonna get a lot of emails on this.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.820]   - Oh my God, we have to distract people from this
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.780]   so they don't email us about this.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.300]   Brandon Sanderson wrote "Name of the Wind."
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.620]   See, I'm trying to distract the audience
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.420]   so they forget about insidious gate.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.380]   (keyboard clacking)
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.360]   I just, blocking on things.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.540]   But here's what makes pseudoproductivity dangerous
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.220]   is that within a current job,
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.240]   it feels like what's giving you good attention.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.820]   It feels like this is what matters.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.300]   Visible activity, my boss sees,
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.740]   I respond to those emails so quickly.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.660]   I am on that Slack channel so fast,
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.740]   like you're not even done sending your Slack message
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.060]   and you see the dots that indicate
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.900]   that I'm typing back in response, right?
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.340]   In the moment, this feels like the most important thing
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.340]   you can do to help your career.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.740]   But as soon as you're left that job
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.380]   and someone says, "Why should we hire you?"
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.600]   None of that matters.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.500]   Pseudoproductivity doesn't actually directly create value.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.260]   You are not going to impress an employer
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.060]   if you say my average interval between inbox checks
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.540]   is only four minutes.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.140]   I was a Slack champion.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.140]   I was on Slack all the time.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.660]   I forced us, I was the employee that forced us
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.380]   to have to upgrade our Zoom package, enterprise package,
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.740]   because I did so many Zoom meetings.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.180]   None of that actually matters to an employer
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.220]   that you're trying to get hired by
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.240]   because none of that directly produces value.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.860]   So that is what's dangerous about pseudoproductivity.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.700]   In the moment, it feels like the most important thing
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.060]   you can do for your career,
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:15.540]   but from a distance, it's meaningless, right?
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.740]   So the stuff that is gonna make it easier for you
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.300]   to get a job is less comfortable in the moment
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.060]   because it's that I'm not answering this email right away.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.420]   I've said no to more things.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.620]   I keep an active waiting list,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.340]   so my active projects are much reduced at any one moment,
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.060]   but I'm finishing stuff that has objective value,
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.780]   the stuff I can put on my resume and talk about.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.140]   I finished this project.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.940]   I introduced this new technology.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.060]   I innovated the way that we do this approach,
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.860]   and it increased customer conversions by 15%.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.060]   That's the stuff that matters
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.660]   when you're trying to get hired for your next job,
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.940]   and that stuff has nothing to do
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.260]   with how fast you answer emails,
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.420]   how quick you're on Slack, or how many Zoom meetings you do.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.220]   So there's like a lesson in this, right,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.740]   is that pseudo productivity is empty calories
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.980]   from a business value perspective.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.340]   Feels good in the moment,
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.740]   but doesn't give you what you need in the long term.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.140]   All right, Howard, now that I'm done using you
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.240]   as a cautionary tale, let's get to your actual question.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.300]   The key is to focus when you're trying to get hired
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.300]   on concrete value that you're gonna add to their life.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.820]   There's this cool book written by Jeff Fox years ago,
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.900]   Jeff Fox, who wrote "How to Become CEO,"
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.940]   which was the inspiration for my first book,
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.940]   "How to Win at College," which I pitched to Jeff's agent,
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.780]   or no, it was Jeff, the editor who bought that book for Jeff
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.100]   who became an agent, Lori, my longtime agent.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:34.940]   I pitched to her.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.440]   I said, "I wanna write 'How to Become a CEO,'
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.660]   "but for college kids."
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.540]   He then wrote a follow-up book
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.740]   called "Don't Send a Resume" about getting hired,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.620]   and he had this sort of extreme idea
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.540]   that's more relevant to sales than other places,
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.100]   but I think the core of the idea is critical.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.080]   He said, "Here's how you get hired.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.380]   "If you get your resume,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.180]   "quantify how much money you're gonna bring in
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.300]   "above your salary, right?
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.380]   "I'm gonna cost you this much money in salary.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.420]   "I'm gonna bring in this much money.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.780]   "The second number is this much larger,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.700]   "so by hiring me, you're getting this much money."
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.400]   So that's ultimately what matters.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.580]   Now, in sales, you can actually do that calculation.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.100]   You can say, "I expect to bring in $3 million in sales
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.780]   "per year, here's my salary,
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.980]   "so this is how much profit you're gonna make off.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.320]   "I'm gonna increase the bottom line by this much."
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.780]   But you can hint at this in non-sales jobs as well
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.800]   by focusing relentlessly on the things you can do
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.940]   that directly brings in value to the company.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.860]   That's what matters.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.220]   Not generic skills, not your people skills,
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.900]   not your character, not what you're owed.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.180]   None of that really matters to them.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.620]   What matters is, does our bottom-line number,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.340]   our profit number, get larger or smaller
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.540]   once we have you on board?
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.940]   We have to take away the expense of your salary?
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.540]   Is the value you bring push us more to the other side?
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   Money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.240]   So that's what you wanna focus on.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.500]   Here's what I did at my last place,
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.800]   here's what I can do here.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.900]   Let's see, Howard is what, a product manager?
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.340]   All right, so here is how I have
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.980]   a product management methodology
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.340]   that increases the value of what we produce.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.700]   I can handle these types of projects, which you need.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.700]   These are higher, these types of projects
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.660]   are higher profit margin.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.920]   I know how to manage those, so you can immediately expand
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   the pool of your projects that are here.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.760]   You know, I can expand this business you have on this side.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.160]   I know how to, you know, double the speed
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.980]   with these things get done because I use like
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.300]   Newportonian non-overload style workload management.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.460]   Whatever it is, what you wanna pitch
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.260]   when you're trying to get hired is how much more money
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.960]   they will have after they hire you.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.820]   And you wanna remember that.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.580]   How much money am I bringing in?
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.740]   And how is this current activity helping
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.060]   the bottom line I bring in?
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.940]   That's really the right meta mindset
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.580]   for evaluating how you're spending your day.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.500]   And it goes back again to the dangerous nature
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.660]   of pseudoproductivity is that it feels so useful
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.780]   in the moment, but it does nothing in the long term
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.780]   that really matters.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.860]   So Howard, I appreciate your question
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.480]   because it gives us an excuse to talk about
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.140]   that bigger principle about the real subtle danger
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.240]   of pseudoproductivity.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.460]   All right, should we play a theme music again?
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.480]   - Yes.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.900]   (soft music)
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:29.740]   - All right, sufficiently relaxed from insidious gate.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.980]   That's just how I'm gonna pronounce it from now on.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.220]   I don't care.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.100]   That's how I pronounce that word.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.380]   I'm old enough now that I can decide
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.340]   how I wanna pronounce words.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.300]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.140]   - We have a call.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.300]   - Ooh, let's hear this.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.660]   - Hey Kel, last time we chatted at your meetup
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.660]   in Washington this past March,
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.900]   I mentioned that I had my first child on the way
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.260]   and he's here now.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.460]   Not gonna lie, it was a lot to handle at the start
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.660]   and I even took your advice from an earlier episode
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.260]   to take some time off.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.340]   I actually took a month off work and business
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.380]   to help with the new transition.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.680]   Now that I'm back at work, how do I continue to work
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.220]   on being so good I can't be ignored
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.940]   whilst raising a new son?
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.620]   I have a feeling your main advice might be
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.180]   to just scale back and go a lot slower,
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.380]   which I've started to do as per slow productivity.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:19.060]   But I'll be honest, going this slow makes me feel
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.220]   like I'm not moving at a fast enough pace that I'm used to.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.420]   And maybe I need to be more patient, I'm not sure.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.140]   Any advice you can offer a new father
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.940]   who wants to be both an excellent husband,
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.340]   excellent father, and a skilled data analyst
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.580]   with multiple business goals ahead of him?
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.780]   Looking forward to your answer
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.580]   and keep up the amazing work you do.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.180]   - Well, good to hear from you again.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.580]   I guess he's probably talking about,
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.960]   we had a couple of meetups in Washington.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.800]   We had the Politics and Pros.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.900]   - He came down from Toronto, it's Kobe.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.040]   - Oh, from Toronto.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.700]   Gave me a copy of a Michael Crichton book.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.180]   Yeah, Kobe, good to hear from you.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:58.420]   Okay, so I would say new kid at home,
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.620]   first of all, there's two different phases.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.980]   The first four months,
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.860]   in my sort of three-time experience here,
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.740]   the first four months is basically all hands on deck, right?
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.460]   So first four months is kind of survival mode, scale back.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.220]   It feels like in the moment forever.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.940]   Like, I guess I have just stepped out of the world of work.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.500]   I guess I have given up all ambitions.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   This is it, my life has changed, but four months is nothing.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.260]   In retrospect, it's nothing.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.060]   So just give yourself a break
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.540]   and be much more useful to your partner
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.820]   for about three to four months.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.460]   All right, after four months,
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.740]   you're not in survival mode anymore.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.060]   I typically use that threshold
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:37.900]   because it's the point
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.220]   at which you have consistency in schedule,
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.620]   especially if you're careful about it.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.140]   This is like when in the US context,
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.140]   a lot of maternity leaves have ended,
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.300]   sleep training is done, you have your childcare,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.980]   your childcare setup for the next couple of years
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.380]   is kind of in place and you can begin to build like,
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.740]   oh, this will be my routine for a while.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.620]   In those first few months,
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.700]   you're not in your routine
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.060]   that you're gonna have for a while.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.620]   So that's why I think of that as like all hands on deck.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.780]   Okay, so after three to four months,
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.100]   I do recommend, yeah, you scale back longer term,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.380]   slow down for a bit.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.380]   This is a big transition.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.060]   But I think this helps people who struggle with this,
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.820]   don't just messily do less,
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.960]   use this as an excuse to clean up what's going on.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.380]   So after you get out of that first all hands on deck period
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.740]   so I don't wanna go back to super busy-ness,
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.420]   let me start cleaning out the stuff
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.500]   I don't wanna be doing in general.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.620]   Maybe this is a good time to say no more X, no more Y.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.100]   Like I wanna take this off my plate to focus more on this.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.380]   Maybe I wanna tighten up my processes a little bit more
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.620]   so that the work I'm doing is more contained
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.600]   or more predictable or a little bit less interruptive,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.500]   has less of an overlap with the other stuff
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.820]   that matters in my life.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.980]   This is an important transition
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.620]   that most people go through with their working life
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:51.980]   when you're younger.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.100]   Like, why am I demanding, you know,
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.900]   to have other people have more structure
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.900]   in how we work together?
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.260]   I have time, I'm around, I just wanna be useful.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.400]   I'm on my way up.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.140]   But then once you have your first kid,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.680]   now you can start to say, okay,
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.300]   I also care about me as well and how work affects me.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.580]   So clean things up.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.940]   Get rid of the dead weight.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.340]   Get in place, like better processes.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:20.080]   The other thing I recommend so that that ambition itch
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.740]   doesn't turn into like an all-out metaphorical rash,
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.820]   as part of sort of cleaning things up
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.260]   and simplifying what you're working on
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.460]   and getting your schedules tighter
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.780]   and not taking on too much work,
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.500]   make sure you have a slow but steady project in there
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.520]   that's just straight up ambition.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.420]   Slow but steady.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.740]   So something where there's not a deadline,
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.960]   no one's waiting for this.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.160]   It's not a source of stress,
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.860]   but that you're making regular progress
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.100]   on some sort of bigger timeframe goal
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.660]   that you're excited about.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.740]   And maybe prioritize that like first thing.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.780]   Like first thing I do every morning
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.220]   after we, you know, get the kid to daycare
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.980]   or whatever's going on is I spend this like first hour
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.780]   working on learning this new skill.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.980]   That's gonna be part of my vision
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.140]   for two or three years from now of like mastering the skill
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.380]   and completely changing my work life.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.660]   Or we're gonna move to Vancouver Island
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.160]   and this is gonna be a thing that's built off of.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.740]   So have this aspirational thing you're working on.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.660]   That scratches your ambition itch
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.260]   in a way that's gonna be much more sustainable
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.940]   in this moment than just trying to take on lots of stuff.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.380]   You don't wanna be overly busy.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.500]   You wanna avoid overload
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.060]   for at least the first year if possible.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.980]   All right, so let me put all this advice together.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.620]   First three to four months, all hands on deck.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.500]   It's okay, it's gonna go faster than you think.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.980]   Rest of that first year,
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.420]   you still wanna be going slower than normal.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.220]   It's a huge adjustment.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.540]   You're also, you're changing you.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.400]   You're a dad now.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.940]   That's like a completely different type of role
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.460]   you're adding to your life.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.620]   But to help support that,
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.780]   so you don't just feel like you're giving up business
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:52.620]   or being irresponsible.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.580]   Clean up, get rid of dead weight work
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.780]   that you've been meaning to get rid of.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.460]   Clean up the processes for what remains
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.420]   and keep that ambition itch scratched
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.340]   by having a slow but steady, non-urgent but exciting project
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.780]   that you're working on regularly.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.660]   Those things all together, that's the right way,
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.460]   I think as like a new dad,
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.800]   to go through this sort of period of new kiddom.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.260]   I mean, I remember this with all three kids,
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.140]   but especially the first two.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.440]   In that first three to four month period,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.580]   like walking my dog and having this thought,
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.700]   like this is chaotic now,
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.460]   but don't extrapolate now is what your life is like.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.500]   Think ahead to four months, the four month mark
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.460]   where we are gonna have our, we're back to a new routine.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:38.660]   And that new routine is gonna be different but sustainable.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.020]   We're getting there and it's gonna be better
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.260]   when we get there and it always was.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.060]   So I remember clearly thinking about that.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.460]   I don't really remember our third at all.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.540]   By that point, it was just too chaotic.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.900]   Two other boys who were older that I was thinking,
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.300]   it's all a blur to me, I don't know.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.100]   I know he was a baby at some point.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:01.180]   And I know, I mean, COVID came, I don't, I just.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.700]   - You started a podcast.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.740]   - Yeah, well, he was older then, he was older.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.900]   Well, I guess he went to, oh man, I just,
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.580]   I was so busy with the other two kids by then
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.420]   that the baby stuff was going on,
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.780]   but I was just like driving toddlers places
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.780]   and then COVID came.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.740]   All right, got a call, oh, we have a case study.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.900]   All right, so case studies where people write in
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.820]   to talk about how they have applied the type of ideas
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.460]   we talked about on the show in their own life.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.300]   If you have a case study you wanna share on the air,
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.740]   send it to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.260]   Today's case study is from Sarah.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:43.700]   Sarah says, "I hope this message finds you well.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.980]   "My name is Sarah and I'm a commercial photographer
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.140]   "based in Texas."
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.380]   All right, "As a photographer,
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.980]   "the freedom of working for myself has its perks.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.780]   "No tedious busy work or endless meetings
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.540]   "like when I worked for a company.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.220]   "I've been able to set a high enough rate
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.380]   "that a few shoots a month keep me afloat.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.220]   "The flip side though is that without a boss
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.700]   "or external structure, I fall into the habit
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.180]   "of only doing the bare minimum to get by.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:09.940]   "I hardly market myself, never pitch
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.420]   "and don't prioritize networking.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.300]   "While inbound inquiries have kept me going,
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.060]   "I know there's potential for so much more,
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.500]   "probably double what I'm making now.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.420]   "With my current workload averaging just 15 hours a week,
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.460]   "I have so much free time
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.140]   "that I can take month-long sabbaticals
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.380]   "going on meditation and therapy retreats.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.140]   "While this might sound like a dream setup,
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.580]   "I often feel like I'm at the mercy
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.700]   "of whatever comes my way
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.260]   "rather than actively shaping the life I want.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.140]   "I lack the discipline to work on my business
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.380]   "rather than just in it,
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.500]   "and I know there's so much untapped potential.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.540]   "With all this extra time,
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.580]   "I decided to go back to school
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.620]   "to pursue a degree in mental health counseling.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.500]   "I'm about halfway through my three-year program.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.620]   "I'm passionate about healing
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.500]   "and want to make a slow transition into this field.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.860]   "While commercial photography feels like
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.020]   "it has a limited shelf life for my age,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.180]   "I can see myself running a private therapy practice
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.460]   "well into my 50s and beyond."
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.820]   All right, so I'm going to cut that there
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.260]   because there's some observations
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.140]   I want to make about this.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.660]   So Sarah, thank you for sharing.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.100]   There are some positive things I want to say about this
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.220]   and some lessons/advice to give.
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.540]   On the positive side,
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.660]   I love the idea here of there's intention
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.980]   in how Sarah's crafting her life.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.260]   I like that she's thinking ahead, right?
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.860]   She's thinking about in her 50s, in her 60s.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.900]   Okay, being a commercial photographer might not work then,
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.300]   but if she gets a therapy license now,
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.900]   that is highly autonomous.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.100]   I know several people my age are going through this now.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.380]   That could be highly autonomous
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.140]   because once you're licensed,
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.940]   you can decide how many clients you have.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:52.420]   There's only so many jobs
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:56.340]   in which you can transmute education,
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.340]   like an undergrad degree and a graduate degree,
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.780]   into something with a high hourly rate
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.820]   and a lot of autonomy.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.700]   Therapy, mental health counseling
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.660]   is one of those things.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.660]   So I like that way that you're thinking.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.180]   I also like the fact that your lifestyle,
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.180]   you have a lifestyle right now where you're working
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.060]   until you went back to grad school,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.700]   15 hours a week and showing that's a possibility,
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.500]   depending on where you live
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.340]   and what your expenses are and if you're careful.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.380]   All of that's really cool.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   The thing I would add,
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.660]   like the lesson I would draw out of this
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.860]   and the advice I would give
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.540]   is that I would lean in more
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.700]   into a lifestyle-centric planning approach.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.780]   It sounds like to me from reading this
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.620]   that this is more ad hoc.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.340]   Photography is fine.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.140]   I like doing it.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.740]   It doesn't take you much time.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.420]   It seems to meet my expenses.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.580]   So you can go in and you're able,
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.220]   it's flexible enough,
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.860]   you can do other things like these retreats.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.100]   But you also have this vague unease of,
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.620]   "I should probably be doing more of this.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.140]   I could probably double this.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.220]   I feel guilty that I'm not,
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.140]   like in creating this business or making it longer.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.500]   I'm going to grad school because like,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.340]   I think maybe it'll be better
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.620]   to be a counselor in the future."
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.300]   All of these instincts can be structured
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.100]   and understood better
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.060]   in the framework of lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.140]   Like figure out now your ideal lifestyle
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.460]   in this sort of decade that you're in right now.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:19.700]   Do this same exercise for your 60s and 70s.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.540]   Like what are the elements that matter?
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:23.300]   This will give you a lot of clarity
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.020]   about things like the therapy practice
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.100]   that you're thinking about creating.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.140]   It'll allow you, for example,
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.340]   like does this make sense?
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.260]   And if so, I know exactly what I need out of this.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.500]   Let me talk to real people and see, is that possible?
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.220]   And if it is possible,
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.180]   what do I have to be doing now
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.940]   to set that up for 10 or 15 years from now?
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.660]   So make sure that you have
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.580]   evidence-based pursuits here,
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.780]   not just dream-based pursuits.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.580]   A lot of people in this situation
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.180]   don't want to talk to real people
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.380]   because they don't want to know the reality,
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.500]   because the reality might mismatch
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.020]   with their dream of what's possible.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.300]   Get the real information.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.900]   It will also help you better make sense
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.020]   of what's going on right now.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.220]   Is it a problem that you're working
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.980]   15 hours a week and not 30?
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.020]   I mean, what are you not able to do
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.140]   in your lifestyle-centric plan?
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.100]   Is there something you can't do
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.140]   that that will unfold?
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.180]   Like you might turn out like,
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.060]   "Actually, this is great.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.100]   The amount of money I'm making now is enough
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.620]   because my instantiation
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.820]   and my lifestyle-centric plan
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.700]   survives on it."
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.580]   Or maybe you realize,
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.860]   "Oh, I'm really held back.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.220]   If I made this much more,
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.740]   then it would unlock
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.540]   all of these other things.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.740]   I could move to this part of Texas
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.220]   from this part,
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.100]   and I could start doing this thing
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:24.660]   that matters to me
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.780]   and be closer to family."
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.660]   Maybe you'll realize like,
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.460]   "If I had this much more dollars,
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.980]   I could have a much better instantiation."
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.100]   It would give you clarity.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.260]   And with this clarity
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.300]   could come clear plans.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.700]   So if you found out like,
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.500]   "Actually, if I could make
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.460]   this much more money,
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.460]   I could shift to this instantiation
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.180]   of my ideal lifestyle,
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.620]   which is gonna be much better."
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.980]   Now, hearkening back
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.180]   to our deep dive from today,
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.860]   you could start doing
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.980]   hour cost computations.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.300]   "Well, with the current rate I do
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.500]   in professional photography,
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.340]   the hour cost of this is pretty high.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.220]   But if I increased my rate,
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.820]   I could get the hour cost down to this,
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.180]   which would make this lifestyle
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.540]   instantiation much better.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.820]   How do I get my rate up to this?
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.940]   Oh, I got to learn this skill
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.500]   and that skill.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.860]   I got to invest in this equipment.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.220]   Good, I have a plan to go after."
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.620]   Or, "Okay, I have this instantiation
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.580]   of my ideal lifestyle vision,
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.700]   which I'm not gonna be able to get to
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.140]   with commercial photography.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.660]   I see a way with counseling
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.380]   I could get there.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.460]   And I have hard evidence.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.420]   Like if I had this practice
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.380]   with this many clients,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.100]   I did it this way,
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.660]   I could do it.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.700]   Okay, this will work.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.860]   Now I have my crystal clear vision.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.380]   How do I get to this type of practice
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.500]   as quickly as possible?"
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.660]   On the other hand,
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.460]   if you're like, "This is fine
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.500]   what I'm doing."
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.540]   It gives you structure
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.820]   for what else to do with your time,
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.700]   because you've identified
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.580]   the other things that matter
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.020]   to your ideal lifestyle vision,
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.860]   so that you can with confidence
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.220]   do these things with your time
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.260]   that you're not working.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.700]   And not just feel generally like,
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.660]   "I guess I should work more
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.500]   or go on a month-long meditation retreat."
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.460]   You can have a structure
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.500]   to your everyday life
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.660]   that's meaningful and intentional.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.420]   So you're in a perfect position, Sarah,
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.540]   for lifestyle-centric planning
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.300]   to take this great setup you have
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.580]   and all these options you have
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.340]   and structure them
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.460]   and get the most out of them,
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.820]   both right now and in the future.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.340]   So fantastic case study,
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.740]   but also a fantastic example
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.500]   of where lifestyle-centric planning
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.860]   can make a big deal going forward.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.760]   All right.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.980]   Well, we got a final segment coming up
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.020]   where I react to the internet.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.340]   But first, hear from another sponsor.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.660]   Look, the holidays are here
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.180]   as if there wasn't enough to worry about,
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.300]   as if this wasn't enough
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.500]   to worry about, rather,
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.940]   that you know that there's a heightened risk
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.940]   of data theft and fraud
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:28.980]   this time of year.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.100]   Hackers know you're shopping
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.140]   in a hurry during the holidays,
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.100]   so it's easier than ever
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.140]   to hijack your connection
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.420]   and steal personal information
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.460]   like your credit card numbers
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.980]   and bank passwords,
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.380]   especially on unsecured public Wi-Fi.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.140]   But here's how you can cross
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.820]   online security off your list.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.460]   Do what I do.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.820]   Use ExpressVPN.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.700]   ExpressVPN is an easy-to-use app
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.060]   that encrypts and reroutes
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.260]   all of your online traffic
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.660]   through secure servers,
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.060]   making it virtually impossible to hack.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.860]   So what happens is your real traffic
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.220]   gets encrypted on your computer.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.860]   That unbreakable encrypted packet
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.700]   gets sent to an ExpressVPN server,
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.020]   and that ExpressVPN server
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.220]   unencrypts it and talks to the site
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.420]   or service on your behalf,
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.420]   encrypts the answer and sends it back.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.380]   So people who are watching
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.620]   your local connection learn nothing
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.620]   except that you are talking
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.500]   to a VPN server.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.780]   That's the magic of VPNs.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.100]   ExpressVPN, therefore,
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.460]   can keep your online activity
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.500]   private from third parties
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.780]   like your internet provider
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.300]   and scummy data brokers
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.660]   who want nothing more to bombard you
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.260]   with even more targeted ads
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.220]   during the holiday rush.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.980]   But with ExpressVPN,
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.140]   not even Santa will know
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.060]   what you've been browsing.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.140]   Well, we don't know for a fact, Jesse,
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.180]   that Santa doesn't have a 2048-bit
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.620]   quantum qubit computer
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.100]   that could break factoring problems
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.220]   at a sufficient scale
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:48.820]   to break public-key encryption.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.700]   He probably has one.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.340]   He probably does.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.700]   I am going to assume
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.980]   Santa might have a 2048-qubit
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.700]   quantum computer
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.580]   with which he can run
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.820]   Shor's quantum factoring algorithm.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.620]   Therefore,
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.420]   foiling the public-private-key encryption
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   of Ravesh, Shamir, and Edelson.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.020]   Which is to say,
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.860]   we got to take down Santa.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.300]   All right, but outside of Santa,
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.580]   no one will be able to actually
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.740]   observe what you're doing
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.180]   when you use ExpressVPN.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.220]   I like ExpressVPN
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.100]   because it's easy to use.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.060]   It takes just one click.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.420]   You can use it on up
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.020]   to eight devices simultaneously.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.420]   So you can protect your whole family
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:27.780]   on your laptops, phones, tablets,
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.380]   and even your smart TV.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.660]   It's no wonder that ExpressVPN
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.700]   is consistently rated
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.140]   the number one VPN on the market
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.180]   by top tech reviewers
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.700]   like CNET and The Verge.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.340]   Plus, there's never been a better time
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.100]   to stay safe than the holiday season.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.300]   Because right now,
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.500]   you can use my special link
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:43.620]   to get three extra months
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.900]   of ExpressVPN for free.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.580]   Just go to expressvpn.com/deep
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.020]   to take advantage of the special deal.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.420]   That's expressvpn.com/deep
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.340]   for three months absolutely free.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.460]   Our next sponsor is,
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.580]   uh-oh, Santa Claus.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.260]   He's upset because we talked
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.300]   about his quantum computer.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.740]   Only during an ExpressVPN ad
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.260]   do I feel okay
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.540]   being sufficiently nerdy
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.340]   to talk about qubits
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.140]   and Shor's algorithm.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.380]   My people out there
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.380]   who know what both those things mean
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.660]   know what I'm talking about.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.540]   No, but I also want to talk
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.540]   about our friends at PolicyGenius.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.540]   The heart of holiday traditions is family.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.300]   But what happens when you're gone?
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.780]   If I decide to go out
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.740]   and if I disappear
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   and there's some candy canes
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.540]   crushed nearby,
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.380]   look to the North Pole.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.620]   I'm just going to put that out there.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.580]   I can say that in public.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.420]   But no, seriously though,
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.300]   look, you got to protect
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.100]   your family's future
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.180]   and peace of mind with PolicyGenius
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.300]   because it makes finding
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.860]   and buying life insurance simple.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.460]   We've talked about
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.740]   lifestyle-centric planning
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:49.860]   on this show.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.820]   Here's an aspect of that
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.260]   you really got to keep into account.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.420]   Do you have enough life insurance?
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.660]   If the unfortunate happened to you,
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.420]   would your loved ones been taken care of?
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.180]   A lot of people in my situation,
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.260]   approaching middle age,
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.340]   young family realizes
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:05.860]   they don't have enough life insurance.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.820]   And why not?
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:07.620]   It's not expense.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.420]   Term life insurance
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.380]   is not that expensive.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.820]   It's because of complexity.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.340]   Where do I even start?
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.380]   Who do I even talk to?
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.860]   That is where a service
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.980]   like PolicyGenius enters
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.420]   because it makes it simple
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.900]   to cross the amount
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.260]   of life insurance you know you need
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.940]   to get that task off your list.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.380]   PolicyGenius makes that simple.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:26.980]   With PolicyGenius,

[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.220]   that start at just $292 per year
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.980]   for $1 million of coverage.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.380]   Some of these options are 100% online
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.180]   and let you avoid
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.900]   unnecessary medical exams.

[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.180]   in action as painlessly as possible.

[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.420]   life insurance through work,
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.860]   it may not protect your family's needs
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.620]   or follow if you leave the job.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.860]   I had to add a lot more life insurance
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.500]   when I figured out
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.460]   what I was getting through my work.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.380]   It's kind of negligible.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.340]   So you really want to make sure
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.340]   you have enough. Join thousands

[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.860]   All right, Jesse,
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:50.900]   let's go to our final segment.
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.460]   So one of the final segments
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.580]   we'd like to do here on the show
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.780]   is me reacting to stuff
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.460]   that you, my listeners, have sent me
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.300]   that have been making the rounds
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:09:59.940]   on the Internet.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.620]   Here's something that
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.500]   many of you sent me,
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.740]   which is that Oxford
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.140]   has named their annual
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.500]   Word of the Year for 2024.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.060]   Jesse, you might be surprised to learn
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.980]   that word is insidious.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.060]   And they say that's how it's pronounced.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.380]   Anyone else who says it's wrong.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.740]   No, the Word of the Year is brain rot,
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.540]   which actually created some controversy
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.220]   because grammar people are saying
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:29.780]   that's two words.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.700]   I thought it was two words.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.260]   Two words.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.140]   But I guess the Word of the Year
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.660]   can be two words, whatever.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.340]   This is interesting.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.460]   Let me read a little bit about it.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.620]   I have the article up here on the screen
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.340]   for those who are watching
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.220]   instead of just reading.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.820]   Here's from Oxford University Press.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.460]   Brain rot is defined
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.140]   as the supposed deterioration
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.100]   of a person's mental
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.620]   or intellectual state,
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.060]   especially viewed as the result
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.420]   of overconsumption of material,
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.060]   now particularly online content,
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.900]   considered to be trivial or unchallenging.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.220]   Also, sometimes something characterized
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.300]   as likely to lead to such deterioration.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.100]   Our experts noticed that brain rot
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.780]   gained new prominence this year
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.700]   as a term used to capture concerns
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.180]   about the impact of consuming
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:10.900]   excessive amounts
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.340]   of low-quality online content,
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.700]   especially on social media.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.820]   Its usage has increased by 230%
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.380]   between 2023 and 2024.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.860]   That's a cool concept, brain rot.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.660]   It's a good way of describing
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.700]   what I argue you have to avoid
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.660]   en route to cultivating a deep life
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.860]   in our modern digital environment.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.460]   This is one of the biggest disorders
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.100]   of the modern digital environment,
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.100]   is that these empty calorie,
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.140]   highly alluring,
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.060]   algorithmically optimized
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.100]   digital diversions
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.180]   that have billions of dollars
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.620]   of market capitalization invested
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.140]   behind them being irresistible
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.620]   conflict with our Paleolithic brains.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:55.140]   And our brains rot
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.500]   in some sort of symbolic way
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.380]   when we immerse them in the world
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.300]   of the digital trivial.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.140]   And it's not just a bad habit.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.180]   It changes your brain.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.020]   It rots your brain.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.660]   I love this term.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.780]   It rots your brain.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.820]   It makes your experience
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:11.700]   of the world worse.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.620]   It makes your understanding
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.660]   of yourself impoverished.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.780]   And it makes the subjective feeling
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.860]   of your day-to-day degraded.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.580]   So what is the solution to brain rot?
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.660]   I talked about it earlier.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.340]   Rewire your phone.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.420]   Plug it in when you get home.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.260]   If you need it,
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.140]   go to where it is.
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.580]   Don't have it with you
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.540]   as a default crutch.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.220]   Read more books.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.300]   Spend more time walking
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.180]   and reflecting outside
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:39.460]   with no digital
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.660]   connected devices with you.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.580]   Do those three things in 2025.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.660]   So instead of brain rot
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.540]   being the word of the year,
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.980]   it can be like brain recovery.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.220]   Which is absolutely possible
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.420]   when you disconnect
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.180]   from the constant drip
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:56.740]   of the digital.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.500]   So brain rot.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.300]   What would you have chosen
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.180]   for the word of the year?
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.220]   I was thinking about this.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.460]   Brain rot's pretty good.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.300]   What do you think?
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.180]   Slow productivity is two words.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.700]   If we're going to do two words,
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.300]   I'm in business.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.380]   If we're able to do two words,
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:13.940]   I'm in business.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:14.900]   I'm the king of two words.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.060]   Yeah, slow productivity.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.620]   Or as we now refer to it,
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.580]   Globe and Mail's best book of the...
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.900]   What is the award it got?
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.620]   One of the Globe and Mail's
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.540]   best business books of 2024,
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.500]   slow productivity.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.540]   That should be a word of the year.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.420]   I agree. I like that.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.700]   Actually, there's a term
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.540]   that a lot of young kids use.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.700]   Sigma. What does that mean?
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.460]   I give a young kid a lacrosse lesson.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.580]   He always talks about that.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:41.220]   Like it's sigma.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.500]   Do your kids use that term?
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.460]   You tell me sigma
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.540]   and I'm thinking of the Greek letter.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.620]   Like I'm thinking capital sigma,
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.900]   which I'd use for summation
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.860]   or lowercase sigma,
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.660]   which I'm thinking about
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.540]   standard deviation.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.620]   Is it possible that the student
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.620]   you're giving lacrosse practice to
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.820]   was referring to a statistical
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.620]   standard deviation?
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:02.340]   The people I give lessons to,
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.260]   that would be what they're...
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.380]   That might be what they're...
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.500]   He uses it all the time.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.540]   I was like, and he said,
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.060]   it's used by everybody.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.020]   What's the content?
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.140]   Give me like a context.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:11.940]   It's kind of like cool.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.260]   So you would say, for example,
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.740]   here's a new way to hold a lacrosse stick.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.140]   And he would say like that's sigma.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.180]   Kind of, yeah.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:20.740]   All right, hold on.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.460]   I'm looking it up.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.780]   If we use more slang, Jesse,
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.500]   people will think we're
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.620]   much cooler than we are.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.320]   All right.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.300]   Sigma is a slang term
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.580]   used by Generation Alpha
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.500]   to describe a person or thing
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.820]   as cool, confident, or independent.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.140]   A sigma is a lone wolf
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.060]   who prefers their own company
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.660]   and isn't trying to be the most popular.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.500]   They are confident, but humble
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.860]   and earn respect for their actions
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.980]   rather than words.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.660]   Oh, we could start using this.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.140]   It's used a lot in the younger generation
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.420]   or Generation Alpha.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.620]   I'm a sigma, right?
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.220]   I'm going to call myself a sigma.
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.380]   Is it sigma to refer to yourself as sigma?
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.020]   What I'm going to refer to myself as
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.740]   is sigma squared, right?
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:03.060]   Because if you square sigma,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.060]   well, then you're super sigma.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.620]   So that's how you know I'm sigma
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.060]   is because I'm going to put my,
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:09.540]   you know what I'm going to do?
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.660]   I'm going to put my sigma
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.020]   designation in a power law.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.620]   I'm like, yeah, man, I'm like
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.620]   two to the constant factor times sigma.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.500]   Lone wolf, am I right, buddy?
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.940]   And then we do like you do a wolf call.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.300]   I'm glad we're figuring out how to be cool.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.820]   All right, here's another article about it.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:30.980]   Reddit, what does sigma mean
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.020]   in middle school slang?
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:36.980]   Ooh, look at this answer.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.460]   Interesting.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.100]   Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate,
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.020]   right wing machismo BS.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.260]   Laugh in their face and tell them
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.220]   to can it or get it written up.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.100]   Oh, so there's like a
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.020]   controversial interpretation.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:50.900]   This is a fun discussion.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.100]   Now I'm into this.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.380]   If eighth graders are comfortable
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:54.660]   enough around you to use
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.100]   ironic, goofy slang,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.620]   but respect you enough to be nervous
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:58.820]   to tell you that the urban dictionary
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.540]   definition of it,
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.420]   you've hit that sweet spot,
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.620]   carry on shoulder.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.620]   Nah, this is toxic little boy BS
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.580]   and needs to be addressed.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.140]   JP and AT to use at work.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.580]   Someone else says, I swear to God,
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.260]   this Tate guy is some folks.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.180]   Oh my God, look at this.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:13.300]   They're really getting into this.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.940]   Here's what I'm learning from Sigma.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.740]   And someone else is like,
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.820]   it's a harmless, ironic joke
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.420]   and telling eighth graders not to say it
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.180]   is most def not going to make it work.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.460]   Oh, so I bet.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.540]   Okay.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.580]   It's even before eighth grade
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.540]   because the kid I gave a lesson to
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.820]   is in six or fifth.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.100]   Here's what I think is happening.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.220]   So I think there was like originally
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.220]   a way it was used
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.900]   sort of like manospherically,
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.220]   somewhat like straightforwardly,
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.820]   like maybe it's better than being an alpha
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.940]   is being a Sigma, right?
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:44.100]   So that's like the Andrew Tate reference, right?
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.940]   Like guys our age with like big biceps
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.820]   doing videos about like whatever.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.740]   And that younger kids
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.500]   are ironically using the term
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.220]   because it's cringeworthy
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.580]   the way that it was being used.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.180]   So you can kind of like reappropriate it
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.140]   and be like, yeah, I'm Sigma.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.620]   Is that what, maybe that's what's going on here.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:05.460]   But this is complicated enough,
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.900]   I guess we shouldn't call ourselves Sigma.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.140]   We will invent our own.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.140]   Can we invent our own term?
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.020]   I know all the Greek letters.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.220]   I do a lot of mathematics.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.180]   Well, I think we should be,
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.700]   we could be Epsilon.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.940]   That was my fraternity in college.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.980]   Yeah, we could be Gammas.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.680]   Psi.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.200]   PSI.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.420]   Hey man, that's really Psi of you.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.900]   All right, we're going to invent our own term
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.340]   so it doesn't have all this baggage.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.940]   We are Epsilons,
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.700]   which means like
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:36.980]   a small degree of improvement over a term.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.740]   All right, so forget Sigma.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.140]   The new thing Generation Alpha is to be Epsilon.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:44.500]   And that's our word of the year, I guess.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.220]   And what I'm really learning reading Reddit about this
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.140]   is how much brain rot you get
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.180]   reading Reddit about things.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:53.380]   This is like people fighting about Andrew Tate
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.860]   and going back and go do something useful.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.860]   Be a leader in your community.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.620]   Read a book, learn something hard.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.180]   This is crazy.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.980]   The internet's crazy.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:01.940]   Brain rot indeed.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.220]   All right, that's enough nonsense.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.620]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.500]   I guess next week,
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.980]   yeah, it's going to be like a Christmas Eve episode.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.900]   What's a week from Monday?
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.980]   Yeah, the 20th.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.340]   All right, we recorded the week before.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.260]   Maybe we'll have to get some decorations
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:20.900]   in here for that one.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.420]   We'll go crazy on that one.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.500]   No one listens to the Christmas episode
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.860]   because they're all off on vacation.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.300]   So like we're going to go crazy on that one.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.660]   I'm going to think of something interesting to do.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.060]   We are going to get Sigma in here
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.060]   with our Christmas episode,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.300]   which I guess means like we'll be shirtless
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.180]   and doing creature curls.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.300]   With lacrosse sticks.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.900]   I want to start every podcast
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.020]   with me doing creature curls
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:42.820]   and looking up and saying,
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:43.700]   "Oh, I didn't see you come in.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.740]   Oh, hi there.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.700]   I didn't see you come in here."
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.260]   All right, everyone.
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:48.820]   Thanks for listening.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.660]   We'll be back next week with a crazy episode.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.820]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:58.500]   Hey, if you like today's discussion about our cost
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.100]   and want a more general discussion
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.180]   about cultivating a deep life,
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.260]   check out episode 329,
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.860]   the Tao of Cal,
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.220]   where in 10 minutes or less,
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.380]   I summarize all of my big ideas.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.340]   I think you'll like it.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:10.900]   Check it out.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.820]   So I thought it might be fun
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.140]   to try to do something sort of crazy today
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.380]   to try to summarize
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.260]   most of the main ideas I talk about
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.660]   in five minutes or less.
