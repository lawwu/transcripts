[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.280]   Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.000]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.740]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.300]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.660]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.680]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.280]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.260]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.160]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.200]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.180]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.720]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.760]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.760]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.920]   Well families, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.480]   I can hardly believe that the week of Thanksgiving is here.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.640]   This year has flown by for me and my family,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.180]   and I suspect it has done the same thing for you.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.840]   And as we approach the holiday this week,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.880]   I've got a couple of questions
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520]   for you and your family to consider.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480]   I have a poem to share with you,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.020]   I have a story to share with you,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.880]   and I have a passage from scripture to share with you.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.060]   As we prepare our hearts to be truly thankful,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.920]   I wanna ask you, and maybe, maybe you will choose
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.200]   to listen to this podcast this week as a family,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   maybe as you road trip to a relative's house
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.240]   or to the beach or to the mountains
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.080]   to celebrate Thanksgiving with your family.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.980]   And if you are all together in the car
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.980]   listening to this podcast, maybe you'll stop the recording
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.860]   and talk together about some of the questions
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.260]   that I'm gonna ask you.
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.220]   Here's the first one.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   What does Thanksgiving mean to your family?
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.620]   Now moms and dads, you might want to take this opportunity
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.900]   to share some stories of Thanksgiving
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.480]   when you were a little girl or when you were a little boy
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   and give your kids a picture of what Thanksgivings were like
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   when you were young, when you were growing up.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.600]   Did you go to your grandparents' home?
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.060]   Was that in the city?
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.320]   Was that in the country?
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.600]   Has your family always celebrated
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   a traditional American Thanksgiving?
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.760]   Or is that something new for your family?
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.580]   Do you have other traditions associated with Thanksgiving
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.140]   that maybe many of us don't share
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.600]   but that are very important to your family?
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   What are you being thankful for?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   What do you do together as a family to celebrate?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.680]   When you gather to visit and to eat, what is your family?
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420]   What are you and your friends truly celebrating?
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.920]   For the early settlers in this new world,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.600]   here's maybe something surprising.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Thanksgiving was not always about abundance.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.700]   That's right.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.180]   Thanksgiving was not always about abundance.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.180]   In fact, listen to this poem by Hezekiah Butterworth.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180]   And it's going to remind us that in the beginning,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.580]   maybe Thanksgiving was about something else.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.500]   See if you, as you listen, can discover
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   what these Plymouth settlers were called to give thanks for.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.660]   The title of the poem is "Five Colonels of Corn."
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.940]   'Twas the year of the famine in Plymouth of old,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.940]   the ice and the snow from the thatched roofs had rolled.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.580]   Through the warm purple skies steered the geese or the seas
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.140]   and the woodpeckers tapped in the clocks of the trees.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.220]   And the boughs on the slopes to the south winds lay bare
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.220]   and dreaming of summer, the buds swelled in snow.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.540]   The buds swelled in the air.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.340]   The pale pilgrims welcomed each reddening morn.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.340]   There were left but for rations five kernels of corn,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.160]   five kernels of corn, five kernels of corn.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.720]   But to Bradford, a feast were five kernels of corn.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.620]   Five kernels of corn, five kernels of corn.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.620]   Ye people be glad for five kernels of corn.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.660]   So Bradford cried out on bleak burial hill
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.800]   and the thin women stood in their doors, white and still.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.080]   Lo, the harbor of Plymouth rolls bright in the spring.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.360]   The maples grow red and the woodrobins sing.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.720]   The west wind is blowing and fading the snow
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   and the pleasant pines sing and the Arbutus' blow.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.500]   Five kernels of corn, five kernels of corn
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   to each one be given five kernels of corn.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.620]   Oh Bradford of Austerfield hast on thy way.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.820]   The west winds are blowing o'er Provincetown Bay.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   The white havens bloom but the pine domes are chill
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.980]   and new graves have furrowed Precisioners Hill.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.940]   Give thanks all ye people, the warm skies have come.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.980]   The hilltops are sunny and green grows the home
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.860]   and the trumpets of winds and the white march is gone.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.180]   Five kernels of corn, five kernels of corn.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.180]   Ye have for thanksgiving five kernels of corn.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.540]   The ravens gift eat and be humble and pray.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.540]   A new light is breaking and truth leads the way.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.940]   One taper, a thousand shall kindle.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.640]   Rejoice that to you has been given the wilderness voice.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.460]   Oh Bradford of Austerfield daring the wave
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.380]   and safe through the sounding blasts leading the brave.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.020]   A deed such as thine was the free nation born
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   and the festal world sings the five kernels of corn.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.900]   Five kernels of corn, five kernels of corn.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   The nation gives thanks for five kernels of corn.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.000]   To the thanksgiving feast, bring five kernels of corn.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.440]   You see thanksgiving might be a season
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.620]   and not always in the fall.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.100]   These settlers celebrated in this poem,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.680]   you can tell by the wording,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.060]   they were celebrating the coming of spring,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.640]   coming warmth and a chance, another chance,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.540]   a new chance to grow food.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   They celebrated in this poem not abundance but survival
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.560]   with five kernels of corn.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   And it was a call to remember not abundance but enough
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:31.120]   and the fact that through the providence of God,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.000]   they had survived.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So what will you and your family be thankful for this season?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.800]   Think about what are your basics
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.460]   that keep your family going?
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.360]   These Plymouth settlers were not celebrating abundance,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   they were celebrating the just barely enough.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.160]   They were celebrating what kept their hearts hopeful
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.640]   and their bodies alive.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   So what are the basics that keep your family going?
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.280]   And if you want to read that poem again,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.200]   you can find it in Words Aptly Spoken American Documents.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.700]   I also want to share a story for you.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.200]   It's called The First Thanksgiving.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.160]   It is by Albert Blaisdell and Francis Ball
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.480]   and it is one of the stories that you can find
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.400]   in New World Echoes.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   So if you want to use this like a read aloud,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.560]   you can just listen.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.680]   But if you'd like for it to be a follow along,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   you can find this story in New World Echoes on page 171.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.860]   It's called The First Thanksgiving.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:04.760]   All through the first summer and the early part of autumn,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.920]   the pilgrims were happy and busy.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.560]   They had planted and cared for their first fields of corn.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.960]   They had found wild strawberries in the meadows,
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   raspberries on the hillsides and wild grapes in the woods.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.040]   In the forest, just back of the village,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.480]   wild turkeys and deer were easily shot.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.960]   In the shallow waters of the bay,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.760]   there was plenty of fish, clams and lobsters.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.260]   The summer had been warm with a good deal of rain
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.160]   and much sunshine and so when the autumn came,
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.800]   there was a fine crop of corn.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.960]   Let us gather the fruits of our first labors
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.980]   and rejoice together, said Governor Bradford.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.960]   Yes, said Elder Brewster, let us take a day
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.120]   upon which we may thank God for all our blessings
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   and invite to it our Indian friends
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.160]   who have been so kind to us.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.040]   The pilgrims said that one day was not enough
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   so they planned to have a celebration for a whole week.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.980]   This took place most likely in October.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.780]   The great Indian chief, Massasoit,
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.340]   came with 90 of his bravest warriors,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.900]   all gaily dressed in deer skins, feathers and fox tails
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   with their faces smeared with red, white and yellow paint.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.980]   As a sign of rank, Massasoit wore around his neck
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.980]   a string of bones and a bag of tobacco.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.440]   In his belt, he carried a long knife.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.500]   His face was painted red and his hair was so daubed
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.500]   with oil that Governor Bradford said he looked greasily.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.280]   Now, there were only 11 buildings
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   in the whole of Plymouth Village, four log storehouses
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.760]   and seven little log dwelling houses.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   So the Indian guests ate and slept out of doors.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.940]   This was no matter, for it was one of those warm weeks
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.400]   in the season we call now Indian summer.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.940]   To supply meat for the occasion,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.580]   four men had already been sent out to hunt wild turkeys.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.560]   They killed enough in one day
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.460]   to last the whole company almost a week.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.100]   Massasoit helped the feast along
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.580]   by sending some of his best hunters into the woods.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.020]   They killed five deer, which they gave
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.020]   to their pale face friends that all might have enough to eat.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.340]   Under the trees were built long, rude tables
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.660]   on which were piled baked clams, broiled fish,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.820]   roast turkey and deer meat.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.220]   The young pilgrim women helped serve the food
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.740]   to the hungry Redskins.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.460]   Let us remember two of the fair girls
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.820]   who waited on the tables.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.540]   One was Mary Chilton who leaped
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.140]   from the boat at Plymouth Rock.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.580]   The other was Mary Allerton.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   She lived for 78 years after this first Thanksgiving
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.340]   and those who came over in the Mayflower,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.980]   of those, she was the last to die.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.640]   What a merry time everybody had during that week.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.500]   It may be they joked Governor Bradford
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.660]   about stepping into a deer trap set by the Indians
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.700]   and being jerked up by the leg.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.860]   How the women must have laughed
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.260]   as they told about the first Monday morning at Cape Cod
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.020]   when they all went ashore to wash their clothes.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.040]   It must have been a big washing
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.300]   for there had been no chance to do it at sea
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   so stormy had been the long voyage of 63 days.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.100]   They little thought that Monday would afterward
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.800]   be kept as wash day.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.780]   Then there was young John Howland
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.180]   who in mid ocean fell overboard
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.220]   but was quick enough to catch hold of a trailing rope.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.860]   Perhaps after dinner he invited Elizabeth Tilley
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.220]   whom he afterward married to sail over to Clark's Island
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.860]   and returned by moonlight.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.860]   With them it may be went John Alden and Priscilla Mullins
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.940]   whose love story is so sweetly told by the poet Longfellow.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.460]   One proud mother we may be sure
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.580]   showed her bright eyed boy peregrine white.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.900]   And so the fun went on.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.140]   In the daytime the young men ran races,
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.240]   played games and had a shooting match.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.500]   Every night the Indians sang and danced for their friends
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.080]   and to make things still more lively
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.840]   they gave every now and then a shrill war whoop
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.580]   that made the woods echo in the still night air.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.780]   The Indians had already learned to love
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.940]   and fear Captain Miles Standish.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.540]   Some of them called him boiling water
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.500]   because he was easily made angry.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.420]   Others called him Captain Shrimp
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.840]   on account of his small size.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.860]   Every morning the shrewd captain put on his armor
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.980]   and paraded his little company of a dozen or more soldiers
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.220]   and when he fired off the cannon on Burial Hill
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.820]   the Indians must have felt that the English
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   were men of might thus to harness up thunder and lightning.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.620]   During this week of fun and frolic
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.480]   it was a wonder if young Jack Billington
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.100]   did not play some prank on the Indians.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.280]   He was the boy who fired off his father's gun one day
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   close to a keg of gunpowder
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.460]   in the crowded cabin of the Mayflower.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.300]   The third day came.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.460]   Massa Soyet had been well treated
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.780]   and no doubt would have liked to stay longer
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.620]   but he had said he could stay only three days
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.480]   so the pipe of peace was silently passed around.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.620]   Then taking their presence of glass beads and trinkets
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.380]   the Indian king and his warriors said farewell
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.460]   to their English friends and began their long tramp
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.080]   through the woods to their wigwams on Mount Hope Bay.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.760]   On the last day of this Thanksgiving party
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.700]   the pilgrims had a service of prayer and praise.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.080]   Elder Brewster preached the first Thanksgiving sermon.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.280]   After thanking God for all his goodness
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   he did not forget many loved ones sleeping on the hillside.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.000]   He spoke of noble John Carver the first governor
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.180]   who had died of worry and overwork.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.080]   Nor was Rose Standish forgotten, the lovely young wife
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.820]   of Captain Miles Standish whose death was caused
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.760]   by cold and lack of good food.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.260]   And then there was gentle Dorothy, wife of Governor Bradford
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.460]   who had fallen overboard from the Mayflower
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.620]   in Provincetown Harbor while her husband was coasting
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.340]   along the bleak shore in search of a place for a home.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.100]   The first Thanksgiving took place nearly 300 years ago.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.980]   And since that time almost without interruption
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.120]   Thanksgiving has been kept by the people of New England
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.160]   as the great family festival of the year.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.480]   At this time children and grandchildren returned
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.540]   to the old home, the long table is spread
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.320]   and brothers and sisters separated often by many miles
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.380]   again set side by side.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.100]   Today Thanksgiving is observed in nearly all the states
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.900]   of the union, a season of sweet and blessed memories.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.620]   And this story you can read again
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.440]   in the Copper Lodge Library book, New World Echoes.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.140]   It's called The First Thanksgiving.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.220]   Now you probably noticed toward the end
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.600]   I mentioned, well, I read in the story it said
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.940]   the first Thanksgiving took place nearly 300 years ago.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.500]   And those of you who are really good at mental math
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.340]   are probably thinking that number seems way off to me.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.900]   And you're right, but here's the thing.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.460]   This story was written by Albert Blaisdell
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.540]   and Francis Ball in 1915.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.560]   So they counted from 1915 back to the very first Thanksgiving
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   and we are more than 100 years ahead of that telling.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:45.920]   So what do you think about that story?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.960]   Where do the details come from?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.160]   There are journals that give some of the perspective
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.180]   of some of the people who lived in the colony
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.860]   and participated in that first Thanksgiving.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.300]   There are lots of things that happened
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.200]   in that first Thanksgiving that probably do not happen
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.680]   in any of the celebrations that you're a part of.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.440]   You might play games outside,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.120]   but I bet that they're not shooting matches.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.880]   They probably pick up football games.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.120]   You probably have really good things to eat,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   but not a lot of people have roasted clams
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.140]   on their Thanksgiving table.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.380]   You have many things to be thankful for,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:43.160]   but they are probably different things
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.980]   than those of the first Thanksgiving participants.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.780]   So here's something for you to think about with your family.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.000]   For what are we thankful?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.520]   And you know what?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.840]   It's easy to just say, oh, I'm thankful for my mom
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.460]   and for my dad and for my home and for my bed
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.400]   and for good food.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.160]   Let this Thanksgiving be a real time for you to reflect
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   not only on the things that you are thankful for,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.560]   but the people for whom you are thankful
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   and the intangibles like safety and freedom
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:36.920]   and love and hope that you may also celebrate.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.040]   So think about this with your family.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.080]   How do we show our thanks?
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.000]   As little kids, most of us are taught to say thank you
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.980]   and please to express thanks for a good meal by saying,
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.920]   when I was a little girl, I always had to say
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.520]   before I was excused, may I be excused?
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.480]   I enjoyed it after every meal,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   even when I did not truly enjoy it, okay?
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.440]   So many of us give thanks verbally,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.160]   but how else do we express our thanks?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   What attitude can we show that speaks thanks?
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   What words of, what deeds of service might we do
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.380]   that could express our thanks?
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.320]   To whom are we thankful?
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   Maybe you are thankful this season for another family member
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.800]   who has blessed you or served you in some way.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.280]   I suspect that upon deep reflection,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.880]   we are all thankful to the Lord
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.120]   and it might be a great exercise as a family
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.840]   to think about what are you thankful to the Lord for
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.360]   in this day, in this week, in this month,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.220]   in this season, in this year?
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.840]   So one thing that we saw in this story,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.440]   the first Thanksgiving, was that the settlers,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   the early settlers wanted to share the spirit of Thanksgiving
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.080]   not just with their neighbors who had come with them
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.940]   over on the Mayflower, but with the new friends
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.080]   that they had made in the new world.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   So how is sharing a part of saying thanks?
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.540]   Many of us celebrate Thanksgiving with family members
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.260]   that we don't see often or that at least
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.000]   we don't see every day.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.700]   Maybe you have a Thanksgiving ceremony with your neighbors
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.500]   or with your church family or even with your CC community.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.500]   How does sharing help us say thanks?
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.940]   And here's another, here's another thought.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.380]   Are we only thankful for our happy times?
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.800]   Are we only thankful for the good things
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.740]   that we see in our lives?
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:26.620]   How can God lead us to grow into becoming thankful
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.880]   for the hard times and the trying circumstances?
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.520]   In what ways can we become thankful for those?
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   What do those things offer us that cause us to grow
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:48.640]   in our understanding of the Lord and our appreciation
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.400]   for all He does for us?
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.360]   How can remembering hard times
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.600]   bring us a spirit of gratitude?
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.440]   So I ask you, talk with your family,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.320]   what are you remembering this year
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.820]   and how can you honor those memories?
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.320]   As we end our time together on the podcast today,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   the Giving Thanks podcast, I want to share with you a Psalm.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.040]   I think it might be the first long passage
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.960]   that I ever memorized as a second grader.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.180]   And it resonates with me sometimes in the night,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.860]   sometimes during joyful times, but also during hard times.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.920]   The Psalm 100 calls me to be thankful
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.600]   and I hope it will call you to be thankful.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   Psalm 100, shout for joy to the Lord all the earth.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.320]   Worship the Lord with gladness.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.080]   Come before Him with joyful songs.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   Know that the Lord is God.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.600]   It is He who made us and we are His.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.400]   We are His people, the sheep of His pasture.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:37.140]   Give thanks to Him and praise His name,
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   for the Lord is good and His love endures forever.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:49.120]   His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:57.020]   The Lord is worthy of our praise and our truest measure
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.680]   of thanks belongs to Him.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.640]   For the Lord is good, His love endures forever
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:15.000]   and His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   Happy Thanksgiving, you guys, and I will look forward
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.600]   to celebrating Advent with you when we meet again.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.660]   And hey, before we go, if you're traveling for Thanksgiving,
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.360]   maybe you're traveling when you hear this,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.760]   I wonder if you know that there are other
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   classical conversations, podcasts that you might enjoy.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.140]   If you're a mom looking for parenting tips
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.360]   or stories of encouragement or just some fun,
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.820]   honest conversation about the ups and downs of motherhood
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.240]   with moms at all stages, then you need to join
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.200]   Delice and Jenny, they are the hosts
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.640]   of Blessings and Motherhood.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.900]   These are really fun, thoughtful episodes
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.880]   packed with lots of insights and book recommendations
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.200]   and stories, they're just a lot of fun.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.980]   Delice and Jenny are fun to listen to.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.240]   And if you are interested in current events
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   or politics or culture or classical education
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.500]   and how your Christianity relates to all these topics,
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.320]   you need to check out Refining Rhetoric
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.240]   with Robert Bortons.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.280]   On this show, Robert, who is the CEO
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.800]   of Classical Conversations, Robert guides listeners
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.440]   using the 15 classical tools of learning
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.480]   to navigate current events and critical issues.

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.000]   and I think you would really enjoy listening to this.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.560]   If either of these sounds up your alley,
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.000]   you can listen to both of these shows
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.440]   on your favorite podcast streaming app
