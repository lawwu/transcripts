[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.480]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in the third chapter and the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.480]   The sixteenth verse in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, that he
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.640]   would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.840]   his Spirit in the inner men.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.920]   Now, that's obviously a part of another and a larger statement, so I'm going to read from
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.840]   verse fourteen to verse twenty-one.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.160]   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.080]   family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.680]   of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner men.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.880]   That, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   depth and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.760]   be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.720]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.080]   according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.560]   Amen.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.680]   You will never hear anything greater than that.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.240]   However long you may live in this world, whatever orator may arise, you will never hear anything
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.640]   equal to that in eloquence, in elevation of thought, in profundity of language and of
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.400]   conception.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.800]   It is undoubtedly one of these great mountain peaks in the scripture.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.560]   There are many who would say, and I have no doubt that they are right, that this is the
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:30.160]   highest peak of all in the whole glorious range of scripture, truth, of divine revelation.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.520]   We are looking, you remember, at the actual prayer which the apostle offers for these
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.500]   Christian people in Ephesus to whom he writes this great and vital letter.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.320]   We saw last Sunday morning how he approaches God and how careful he is to remind us of
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   that and to insist upon our realizing that.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   He bows his knees before the Father.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.280]   Thank God he is not only his Father in Jesus Christ, but he is the Father of all these
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.720]   Ephesians also, the Father of every Christian.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.400]   Through our blessed Lord and Savior, we are entitled to say, "Our Father."
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.160]   We have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him to the Father.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:36.240]   Well, very well, having thus entered into the presence of God, what is it that the apostle
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.680]   prays for these Ephesians who are so much upon his heart?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.280]   Now we have in the scriptures many recorded prayers of this great apostle.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.640]   They all are worthy of our most careful and serious consideration and always well repaced
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   up.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.840]   He says, "There is nothing, no prayer of his which rises higher than this one."
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.320]   He really does lift us here right into the heavens and prays for things which are almost
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:23.480]   incredibly rising, you remember, to that climax, that he might be filled with all the fullness
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   of God.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.880]   Now this is what he writes to these Ephesians, many of whom had been slaves and were perhaps
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.720]   still slaves, probably were.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   People who are unknown, we have never known their names, we know nothing about them, but
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   all we do know is that they were Christians.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.360]   And because of that, the apostle here offers this prayer for them and takes us, as we look
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.120]   at his prayer and study it together, to the very highest reaches, the topmost level of
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:05.520]   Christian experience and of what is possible for us in this present world.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.000]   And therefore we are going to look at this together and we are going to examine it carefully
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.280]   and closely, there is no doubt at all, but that here is the real key to true Christian
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.200]   living.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.560]   And therefore we cannot spend too much time with it, we cannot examine it too closely.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.440]   Now let us look at it first of all in a more or less general manner.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.600]   Let us bear in mind, as we do so, the context, the conditions in which and under which the
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.840]   apostle was praying and the conditions which applied also to the Ephesians.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   For this cause, he says, he has been unfolding to them this wonderful doctrine of the Christian
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.760]   church at the end of chapter 2, and has been reminding them that they are all stones in
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.960]   this lively building, this living building that is going up.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.760]   And he now wants them to realize that because of that there are certain things that must
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.360]   follow quite inevitably, because that is their position in Christ.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.560]   Well then he says, I want you to realize the possibilities that are open to you, not only
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.520]   that because you are that, I want you to realize what you must be in order that you may function
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.440]   like that, in a worthy manner, and in the manner for which you were designed.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.320]   But at the same time, the apostle it seems to me is also undoubtedly carrying in his
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.800]   mind what he has been saying in this digression that we have been looking at from the second
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   verse to the end of verse 13.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.280]   This tendency on their part to be worried and concerned about him being in prison, and
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.360]   perhaps fearful of persecution themselves and of certain things that might happen to
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   them.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.920]   Very well, there is our setting and our background.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.960]   Now he prays for them.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.920]   What does he pray for?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.480]   And here at once we notice something very remarkable.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.080]   We must notice first of all what he doesn't pray for.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.160]   To me that's very significant.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.220]   And as we read our scriptures we must always be careful to observe things like that.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:34.920]   What the scriptures do not say at times is almost as important as what he does say.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.840]   And here it seems to me that what the apostle doesn't pray for has a tremendous significance
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   for us.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.880]   Because, put it like this, imagine yourself in the position of the apostle.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.800]   How would you have prayed for these Ephesians?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.080]   What would you have prayed for?
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.760]   What do we pray for one another?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.080]   What is it when we know that others are in trouble and in difficulties, we do petition
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   for them?
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.240]   What's the character of our intercession?
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   Well now, let's notice therefore what the apostle doesn't pray.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   He doesn't pray for any change in circumstances, either for himself or for them.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.840]   His prayer is not that he may be brought out of prison in order that he may go back and
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.120]   preach to them in Ephesus.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.260]   That was a very desirable thing and I've no doubt that he did even pray for that.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.760]   But that isn't the big thing.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.640]   That isn't the thing he puts in the center.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.440]   That's not the thing he wants to impress upon them.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   He's not praying for a change of circumstances, either for them or for himself.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   He doesn't pray for better circumstances either.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.120]   That isn't mentioned at all.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.960]   Neither does he merely offer some kind of general prayer for them, that God may bless
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.400]   them and that God may be good to them.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   I'm emphasizing this particularly because it seems to me that this is the negative that
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.920]   is most important here.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.520]   Far too often our prayers are just general.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.360]   We pray God's blessing upon people.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.560]   We pray that God may be gracious unto them and may look upon them.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.680]   And we leave it in that way as some kind of a general prayer.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.400]   Now the apostle doesn't do that.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   Well what is his prayer?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   Well look at it positively.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.640]   Here is his prayer.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.600]   Here is the first petition, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:40.080]   to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   Now here we find what is always a characteristic of this man's prayers, and what is always
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   at the same time the characteristic of all the biblical prayers, Old Testament and new.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.360]   Here we are introduced to the characteristic Christian way of viewing these problems that
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.880]   are incidental to our lives in this world, many of which arise directly because of our
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.960]   profession of the Christian faith.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.120]   Well now then, what are the two characteristics?
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.040]   Well here they are.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:26.360]   The first is, you notice, that his prayer is an exclusively spiritual one.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.400]   What he is praying about is the spiritual condition of the people, not the material,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.840]   but the spiritual.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.720]   He focuses his attention and his concerns about nothing but their spiritual state.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:50.800]   Now this is a tremendous point, which we ignore at our peril, and of which if we are ignorant,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.840]   well the sooner the better, we acquaint ourselves with it.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.960]   His whole attitude is a spiritual one, and he starts with the spiritual, always, exactly
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.120]   as our Lord himself did.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.840]   When he put it, you remember, like this, "See ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.640]   and all these other things shall be added unto you."
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.040]   He was dealing with people who were always worrying about food and drink and clothing
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.440]   and things like that.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   "Ah," he says, "the trouble with you is that you're starting at the wrong end.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.560]   You're always starting with the material and the seen.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   Start with the unseen.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.920]   See ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness."
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.800]   Now that's exactly what the apostle does here.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.280]   It's the spiritual welfare and the spiritual condition of these people that's uppermost
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   in his mind, the thing that is deeply in his heart.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.640]   That's the first characteristic.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:55.040]   The second is that his prayer is a very specific one.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:02.880]   As I say, it isn't a mere general prayer, but he singles out certain matters, he specifies
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:11.320]   certain things, he isolates certain particulars, and in particular he brings them forward one
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.440]   by one in his prayer to God on behalf of these people.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.320]   Now then, here is another very important point.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:28.360]   True prayer, true Christian praying, praying in the Spirit, praying in Christ, is not only
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:35.640]   spiritual prayer, but it is always specific.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:45.040]   You know, my friends, we tell a good deal about ourselves in our prayers and in our
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   praying.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:53.000]   I suppose there is no better index, ultimately, to one's spiritual state and condition than
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   one's prayers.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.160]   If a man's prayers are formal, it means that his whole position is very formal.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.960]   If he is more concerned about beauty, of language, and of diction, and of things like that, well,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.800]   you can be sure that his main concern, again, is with the externals.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.280]   Is there freedom?
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.600]   Is there spirituality?
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   Is there displayed an understanding of the essential character and nature of the Christian
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   life?
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.960]   Let's take it individually and singly.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.520]   When you pray to God, what do you pray for?
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.440]   What is your greatest concern about yourself this morning?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.720]   Are you concerned chiefly about circumstances and conditions, your body, your affairs, or
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.560]   are you concerned about your spiritual state and condition?
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.520]   Which is it, I say, that receives most attention and most time in your personal prayers and
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.840]   devotions?
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   Are you primarily concerned, as Paul puts it first, the whole question of your spiritual
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.400]   growth and development, your knowledge of God, your relationship to him, and your enjoyment
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   of him?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   Is that the big thing?
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   Or is it things, these things that belong to the external?
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:22.520]   Well, now I say that the apostle is not only essentially spiritual, but he is specific.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:29.680]   There are certain things with regard to this spiritual condition that he is concerned about
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   in particular, and here he mentions them one by one.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:42.000]   Now I would say again that there is nothing that is really so important and so vital in
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   our spiritual nurture and development than just this very thing.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.840]   This is indeed the key.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   To a true understanding of life, this is the real key to the solution of all problems.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.760]   Now the apostle was concerned about the problems besetting the Ephesians.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yes, but you see, it's this whole question of approach.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.680]   He approaches the particular problems, many of which were material and external, not directly.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.840]   He goes this way around them.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.600]   He starts with this, and he knows that if he puts this right, that that will be right.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.640]   Now that's the thing, it seems to me here, that stands out at the very beginning as we
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.240]   approach this great prayer of the apostle.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.760]   Now then, what does this method therefore really mean?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.840]   What are the characteristics of the method?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.640]   Here are people, there are Christians, he's told us all about that in chapter one and
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.680]   chapter two, they've been converted, they've believed the truth, they've been sealed with
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.120]   the Holy Spirit of promise who is the earnest of the inheritance until the redemption of
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.360]   the purchased possession, and he's already been praying for them that they may understand
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.800]   certain things, yet he hasn't finished.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   No, no.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.840]   He's concerned about them, there are certain things yet, and he knows they've got these
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.120]   problems, they're worrying about him, they've got their own problems.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   What do they need?
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.640]   How is he going to help them in the position in which they are?
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.800]   Well now, here are some of the characteristics.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:30.360]   You notice that he does not make light of the problem.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.200]   The New Testament never does that.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:44.760]   And the truly Christian approach to the problems of life is never one that makes light of them.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.160]   Psychology does that, of course that's the essence of psychology.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.560]   Its concern is not so much with truth as with happiness.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.920]   And psychology being concerned merely to give us a happy feeling is not all that particular
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.840]   as to how it does it.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.640]   So it comes to us and it says it's all right, it may never happen.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   And so on.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.200]   Or it may take the situation and say, well now, come after all, it's not quite as bad,
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   and so on.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.920]   That's not this method at all.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.520]   You'll never find that in the New Testament, never.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.840]   Nor in the Old Testament.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.120]   It never tries to minimize a problem or a difficulty.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.200]   That is, I say, the very opposite of what it does.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.000]   That is the worldly way of trying to help us when we're in troubles and problems.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.920]   We just pat one another on the back and we say it's all right.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.480]   Well it isn't all right.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.200]   And it's very wrong to say that it is all right if it isn't all right.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.680]   Now here is this essential honesty that characterizes the scriptural and the Christian approach
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   always.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.240]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:58.020]   It never promises that the problem or the difficulty or whatever it is will soon be
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.120]   removed either.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.840]   It doesn't just come to us and say, well it's quite true, you are in these circumstances,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.480]   but it's all right, it'll soon be gone.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.520]   You'll never find anything like that here.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.800]   There is nothing so characteristic of the scripture as its realism.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.680]   I want to emphasize this because it does seem to me to be the key to the understanding of
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.920]   this prayer.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:33.240]   The New Testament tells us very frankly and very plainly, "In the world ye shall have
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.800]   tribulations."
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.520]   It doesn't promise us an easy time.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.000]   It isn't a cheery kind of optimism.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.240]   It doesn't say that once you come to Christ the whole world will be changed, you'll walk
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.880]   with a light step, and you'll never have any problems anymore.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.120]   Never.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.400]   Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:05.360]   Unto you on the behalf of Christ it is given not only to believe on his name, but to suffer
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.320]   for his namesake.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:16.920]   "Ye and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions."
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:23.280]   Look at a book like the book of Revelation, which is full of prophecies of trials and
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.120]   troubles and tribulations.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.640]   There's nothing here, you see, which leads us to think that all our difficulties are
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.320]   suddenly going to be removed, that we walk into some kind of magic circle.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.280]   It's quite the reverse.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.120]   In fact it is the reverse because it's not only true, but because if the New Testament
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.400]   didn't do this it wouldn't enable us to meet the situation and to overcome it and to be
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.440]   more than conquerors.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:57.680]   It is of the essence of its method to show us this, that because this is a sinful world
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.280]   there must be trials and troubles and problems and tribulations in it.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.320]   It's because of sin.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.520]   And that is why, you see, a Christian should not be surprised at the state of the world
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   this morning.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.840]   It's your philosophers and psychologists and false optimists who ought to be surprised,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.000]   and they are surprised, and they're cast down of course, because they believe, you see,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.480]   they could put everything right.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.880]   But now the Christian starts with this principle, that while there is sin left in this world
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.360]   there will be trouble.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.680]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.960]   There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.320]   There isn't and there won't be and there can't be.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.920]   Sin, the lust that's in the human breast and heart is the cause of war and discord and
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.160]   all our troubles.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.440]   And while it's there, there will be troubles.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.200]   Now you say this is very pessimistic.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.400]   I say it's realistic.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.100]   It's not pessimistic to face facts.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.680]   Pessimism comes in after you face the facts.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.060]   How do you face them?
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.520]   You see, it's not true optimism just not to look at the facts.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.600]   Because optimism, true optimism, is always thoroughly realistic.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.360]   It starts by looking at everything as it is, at its very worst, and then by the truth that
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.680]   it has, overcomes it.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.520]   Now then, the apostle here, I say, is not promising anything easy or simple.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   No, no.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.920]   There are no shortcuts in the spiritual life.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.120]   There are certain methods and we've got to realize these principles, these premises.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.840]   Now then, what else do we say is a negative?
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.200]   Well just this.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   He doesn't pray that some method may be evolved for fighting these problems and difficulties
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.440]   and situations directly.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.280]   Christianity is never concerned primarily to destroy our enemies or to destroy the difficulties
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.640]   and the problems.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.880]   Well what is its method?
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.200]   Well here it is.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.160]   In the light of all these things, in the face of all these things, he prays that God would
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.560]   grant them, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.840]   spirit in the inner man.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.920]   Now here is the principle.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   And to me it's one of the most thrilling things about this New Testament truth.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.880]   The Christian way of dealing with all these things is not so much to do anything about
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   them as to do something about us.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:43.600]   The Christian method is that which builds up our resistance, this inner man, by the
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   spirit.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:52.640]   Now may I put this to you in the form of an illustration.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:23:02.240]   I often feel that this biblical teaching about the attack and the response is very analogous
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.640]   to that which happens in nature, in the case of the physical body and disease.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.840]   It's a very convenient way of looking at this whole problem.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.480]   Sin and evil and Satan and all the forces and the things that would get us down and
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:26.160]   depress us and destroy us are like diseases attacking, germs and microbes and so on.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   That's the picture.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.400]   Now how does the body deal with this situation?
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:42.280]   At this moment this building is full of germs and viruses of various sizes and shapes, some
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.480]   of them so small that you can't see them, ultramicroscopic.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.400]   And they're very powerful and potent and they're capable of producing terrible diseases
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.520]   and capable of destroying life.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.120]   And we're all the whole time being attacked by these things, whether we're aware of
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   it or not.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.720]   It's there and they're inside us, in our bodies.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:07.000]   Our bodies are full of billions and billions of germs, any of which at any moment can become
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.400]   lethal and destroy us.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.080]   Now then, how does the body deal with these things?
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.480]   Well you see, the method is this.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.920]   There is a mechanism in the body which is designed to resist this attack.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.080]   There's the infection, here is the resistance.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.160]   What is the resistance composed of?
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.280]   Well, you sometimes refer to it as a man's natural constitution, his physique if you
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   like.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.320]   Some men are given better constitutions than others.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.520]   Though you may put them and expose them to the same infection as another, while the other
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.200]   is stricken and struck down, they are unaffected.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Why?
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.560]   Well they've got resistance.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.600]   You've often heard a term like this, that a child for instance is vaccinated and it
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.600]   doesn't take.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.360]   "Oh," they say, "there must have been some mistake, so they do it again, he still
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   doesn't take."
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:08.120]   "Oh," says the doctor, "that child has got a natural immunity, a natural immunity.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.400]   He's done nothing about it, but it's just a part of his nature, his constitution."
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.160]   And so you find people, children and young people now being vaccinated against tuberculosis
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   and so on.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   Some of them don't take.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   What?
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   Natural immunity.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   And what a wonderful thing it is.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.400]   There is a resistance in the body.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   But that resistance is not always very strong, it isn't always very perfect.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   So you see a very good way of meeting this infection, this onslaught, this attack which
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.600]   is made upon us is this, is to build up the resistance.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.960]   Now there are schools of thought about this, as you know.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:55.040]   The way to build up the resistance, you see, is to take exercise, get out into the open
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:03.400]   air, fill your lungs with air and with oxygen, take the right kind of food, build up your
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   resistance.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.240]   There are others, you see, who don't do that.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.600]   They're always taking drugs of various descriptions, trying to meet the enemy directly.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.040]   They're not concerned about building up their resistance, they're dealing in this direct
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.360]   manner with the enemy, taking drugs, taking this or that to relieve or to kill the germs
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.860]   and so on and so forth, or perhaps operating or removing something.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.600]   Now there are two methods.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.680]   And the point I'm making is this, that the method that is being advocated here and being
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:42.200]   implied by the Apostle is this wonderful method of building up the resistance.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.560]   There are the circumstances, there is the attack.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.840]   What does the Apostle pray for?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.800]   Well, this, that God, according to the riches of his glory, may strengthen with might the
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:01.240]   inner man, so that whatever the attack may be, the resistance is so great that he'll
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.240]   be made more than conqueror.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:12.960]   Now here I say we are face to face with the central biblical teaching of how to live in
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:21.360]   a world like this, and how to keep going in it, and how to be more than conqueror in spite
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.880]   of everything that happens in it.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.560]   Now listen to our blessed Lord putting this.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.280]   In the first verse of the 18th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, you will
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:37.000]   find our Lord saying this, that men should always pray and not faint.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.920]   He says if you want to avoid fainting, pray.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   What does prayer do?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:48.280]   Well, prayer, you see, if I may so use it, fills the lungs of your soul with the oxygen
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.200]   of God himself.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:58.800]   If you want to stand on your feet and not to falter, fill yourself with God.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.320]   Pray and not faint.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.400]   In other words, you see, you don't spend your time in dealing with the things that are tending
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   to get you down.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:12.080]   You build up yourself in your most holy faith, as Jude puts it.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:21.880]   Now this is the only way whereby we can ever know what it is to rejoice in tribulations.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.640]   This is the only way of being what the apostle calls, in writing to the Romans in the 8th
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:33.080]   chapter, being more than conquerors in spite of everything that attacks us.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.560]   Or, as he puts it in that 4th chapter of 2 Corinthians, which I read just now, if you
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.520]   want to be able to look at life as it's beating against you this morning and trying to batter
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.800]   you and to get you down, if you want to be able to look at all that and say, "Our light
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.440]   affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.480]   of glory," this is the way.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because he says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   are unseen."
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.120]   It's the same principle you see everywhere.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.320]   Build up the inner man, strengthen the resistance.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.760]   The principle, I think, is an obvious one, isn't it?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.920]   And yet you know we so tend to ignore it or to fail to see it that I'm repeating it and
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.600]   I'll go on impressing it.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.680]   Here's the principle in another form.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.880]   Put the center right and the rest look after itself.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.120]   Put the source of supply right and you needn't worry much about the three.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.960]   The trouble is generally in the source.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.160]   Go back to the beginning.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.520]   There's a proverb which says, "Isn't there as a man thinks, so he is."
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   And it's perfectly true.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.720]   As a man thinks, so he is.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.480]   So you see, if you want to put the man right, put his thinking right.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.600]   Don't go at the men and tackle the problem here and there and elsewhere, piecemeal, simply
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   patching up.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   Go back to the center.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.520]   As a man thinks, it's his thinking that's wrong.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.520]   That's why he is wrong, so put his thinking right.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.120]   Or listen to the wise men who wrote the book of Proverbs.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:15.200]   Listen to Solomon in Proverbs, verse 23 of chapter 4.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.680]   Here it is with all the wisdom and characteristic of the Old Testament.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:31.720]   "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life."
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.480]   Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of your heart are all the issues of life,
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   everything.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.800]   The heart really does control everything.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.760]   And the heart here means, of course, the center of the personality, not merely the seat of
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.760]   the emotions.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.280]   It's the central man.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.960]   Now put that right, and then everything else will be all right.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.320]   Our Lord put that negatively, you remember, when he said this.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   It's not that which comes out which is important in the case of a man, it's that which goes
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   in.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.640]   You see, it's that which is the center, the heart.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.760]   It is out of the heart that come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, and all
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   these things.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.480]   In other words, in the last analysis, you see, it isn't the temptations of the streets
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.360]   of London, it's the heart of the man who's facing them.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.160]   The same men can face the same conditions.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.800]   One falls, the other goes on.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.880]   Where was the difference?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.340]   Not in London, in the heart of the man, out of the heart.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.240]   So you see, the thing you need to pay attention to is the heart.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.680]   Oh, listen to Ezra, putting it in a very lyrical manner.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:51.400]   Ezra understood this principle when he said this, "The joy of the Lord is your strength."
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.140]   And how true it is.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.440]   You want strength to do your work and to do the things that are there waiting for you
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440]   to do.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.680]   Well, now, the tendency is, of course, to pay attention to your muscles and things like
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.840]   that, and you go in for exercise.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   No better.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   What's the matter?
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.400]   "Ah, well," says Ezra, "the trouble is with you."
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.240]   It doesn't matter how physically fit you are.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.840]   If you've got something preying on your mind, if you've got a worry, you won't be able to
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.000]   do your work.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.260]   You may be 100% physically fit, but if there's something gnawing at your heart and upsetting
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.660]   you and worrying you, I say you'll feel physically weak.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.320]   On the other hand, if you are fairly weak in your physique, but suddenly something comes
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.760]   to you which fills you with joy and with gladness, with a kind of divine mirth, suddenly you
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.160]   feel like a giant refreshed, and you've got power as if you could move houses.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.360]   The joy of the Lord is your strength.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.240]   The heart is the thing that really governs everything.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   Well, now, my friends, this is the great principle which the apostle is enunciating here, and
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.760]   he puts it in this interesting form, that he would grant you, according to the riches
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:14.880]   of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:25.480]   Now, let us, as we close this morning, just look at what exactly is meant by this "inner
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.000]   man."
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.720]   We've already got the answer to it in 2 Corinthians 4, 16, where the apostle said, you remember,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:42.120]   "But though our outward men perish, yet the inner man is renewed day by day."
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   Oh, listen again to the apostle saying it in Romans 7, 22.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:56.480]   He says, "I delight in the law of the Lord, after the inner men, the inward men."
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   He's in trouble, you see.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   There are two men in him.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.960]   There is a law in his members, dragging him down.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.680]   But I delight in the law of God, after the inner men.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.960]   Now what is this inner man?
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.800]   Well, obviously, this inner man is the opposite of the outward men.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.120]   How obvious, isn't it?
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.520]   And yet, you know, the trouble with most people in the world this morning, is that they never
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.320]   knew that there was a difference between the inner men and the outward men.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.840]   It's the profoundest discovery we can ever make in our Christian experience.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.560]   The inner man, what is he?
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.840]   Well, he's the opposite of the body and all its faculties and functions.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.520]   It's these other men that's apart from them.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.800]   It is, if you like, the innermost part of our being.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.440]   It's the spiritual part of our being.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.480]   It includes the heart and the mind and the soul and the spirit of the regenerate men,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.840]   the men that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:03.600]   You know, the ultimate trouble with the unregenerate, with the non-Christian, is just this, that
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.240]   he lacks that inner man.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.520]   He doesn't know anything about the inner man.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.000]   He doesn't believe in the inner man.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.080]   He's a man who lives only to the outward part.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.120]   He's living a life in the flesh only.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:30.520]   He's living a life which is really nothing but a life of the body and what you may call
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.880]   the psychical part of men.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.200]   There's nothing spiritual about him.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:42.960]   His whole life is bounded by what he's aware of as sensations in himself and in his correspondence
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.480]   with the world that can be seen and heard and felt and handled.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.400]   That's his only life and that's his total life.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:56.560]   The body and its faculties and its relationships with similar people and similar things in
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.320]   the world in which he finds himself.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.200]   That is the tragedy of men in sin.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:10.120]   That's the tragedy of men as the result of the fall.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:16.960]   He's no longer aware of the fact that he is a spiritual being.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   He is not aware of the fact that there is something higher than all this in men.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.000]   But man is to him, you see, at best just a reasoning animal, an animal who happens to
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.640]   have an extra faculty which is simply in the same order as it were, belongs to the same
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.320]   essential order of things, but it happens to be a higher one.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.160]   The brain which the animal has got has got an extra kink in the case of men and that's
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.640]   the only difference between man and the animal.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.280]   There's no conception of this, I nearly called it duality in men, I mustn't use the term
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.440]   because it's become a dangerous one in the light of the history of theology.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.480]   But let me put it like this.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.280]   He is not aware, I say, that in addition to all that, there is this other part of my being
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.520]   that Paul speaks about.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.640]   I delight in the law of God after the inner man.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.280]   Though my outward man perished, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.520]   Now this other man knows nothing about that and this is the tragedy of men in sin.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   Let me put it in a contemporary form by putting it like this.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:35.880]   The final tragedy of the natural man is that he has got no inner man to retreat into in
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.560]   times of trouble and stress and trial.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   Do you know what I mean, my friend?
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.320]   You know what I mean by retiring into the inner man?
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.480]   You know what it is when your life as a man in this world is overwhelmed by the things
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:02.320]   that are happening and you're on the point of falling and of fainting, but you don't.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   Why?
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.800]   Because you have to retreat into your inner man.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.240]   And it's one of the most blessed experiences we can ever know.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.760]   What I mean by that is, do you see that here was the Apostle Paul, old before his time
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.040]   because of his preaching and his travelling and because of the persecutions and trials
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.360]   that he'd suffered and endured and his body riddled probably with disease, that old eye
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.080]   complaint and other things.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.200]   Some say that he had malaria and so on.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.560]   But obviously he was a very sick man.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   "Our outward man," he says, "is perishing."
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   But he doesn't just sit down in the corner and say, "It's all up.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.520]   I've had a fairly good innings.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.160]   I've got to give place to others now.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   My time's come.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:56.800]   I might as well turn my face to the wall and just face that the end is sure."
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.920]   Not at all.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   When he is realized and has looked with open eyes and with this characteristic honesty
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.960]   on what is happening to the outward man, he then retreats to the inner man and he says,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:17.600]   "But the inner man is renewed day by day.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.520]   As that is falling away, this is being built up.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.840]   As the world is taking that and life and its processes are robbing me of that, this is
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.880]   receiving accessions of strength from heaven and from glory.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.840]   He's retired into the inner man.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.680]   Now the man, I say, who's not a Christian knows nothing at all about this.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.040]   Poor fellow.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:45.960]   He is dependent only upon circumstances and he is entirely controlled by circumstances.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.880]   He lives in one realm only and he knows nothing at all about dishonor.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.540]   And therefore he has no comfort and no consolation.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.440]   So he has to fall back on his psychology and various tricks that he does to himself or
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.040]   rushes off into pleasure just to forget it for the months and so on.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.560]   He really can't face it because he's only got one dimension, only one type, and it's
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.280]   tied up to that other and when that goes, everything's gone.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:21.440]   And he becomes depressed and disconsolate and wretched and hopeless.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:28.880]   But thank God, what happens to us when we become Christian and receive this gift of
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:39.000]   the new birth and the new life is that a new man is put into us, a new order of life, a
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.160]   new realm, something spiritual, something unseen, not the temporal, not the visible,
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.760]   not the vanishing, something which is of God.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.360]   We are made partakers of the divine nature, a seed of divine life.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.320]   This is scripture, is put into us and it grows and it develops and even that may help it
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   to develop.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:06.920]   Even trials and tribulations often stimulate us in a most glorious manner.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:12.880]   I'm hesitating because I'm almost tempted to put it like this to you in a very personal
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.760]   form.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.480]   You know because of this inner man that is in us, we sometimes are unable to have great
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.760]   victories over the devil.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.640]   The devil attacks us in many ways as I'm hoping to show you next Sunday morning in treating
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.480]   this whole question of the inner man and his need of strength.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.920]   But you know he sometimes overdoes it and he makes a mistake and he thereby reminds
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.200]   us of the position.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.560]   The devil, as I'm going to tell you, will sometimes just keep us in a general state
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.240]   of depression, weather like this for instance, and a man's particular constitution and bad
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   circulation.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.520]   He feels slack, he can't think, he can't do things and the devil encourages us with
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.720]   thoughts, it's hopeless and so on.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.200]   But then he sometimes makes the mistake you see of too open an attack, perhaps in somebody
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.400]   else.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.320]   Something is doing to somebody else and in seeing what he does to another you're suddenly
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   awakened to the fact that it's he who's really doing it to you and the inner man is revived
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:19.360]   even by the problem from the outside and you overcome him and you're more than conqueror.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.920]   I leave you with this this morning.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.040]   Do you know about the inner man?
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   Do you know that you've got an inner man?
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.720]   Is there this other that you're aware of, that you go into and retire into, this thing
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:43.160]   though the outward is falling and collapsing and decomposing while you're watching it,
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:49.520]   is being renewed day by day and is being built up and has a vision of glory which is incorruptible
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.080]   and undefiled and that fadeth not away.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:00.920]   The whole secret as the apostle here reminds us is that we've got an inner man and when
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:10.080]   that inner man has been strengthened by the Holy Spirit it rarely is comparatively unimportant
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:17.000]   as to what happens around you and even to the outer man himself.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.480]   May God give us the assurance of the possession of the inner man, the spiritual man, the new
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   man in Christ Jesus.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:28.920]   Amen.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:35.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
