[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.440]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   I am your host.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.160]   And today I want to share with you some ideas to help you to embrace your financial mistakes
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.520]   as part of your learning.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   If you want the one-sentence synopsis of this show, it's simply this.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.040]   Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.880]   But only if you're actually paying attention.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.760]   First, a couple of questions for you on the topic of learning.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.280]   One of the major errors I see us making in modern life is we neglect the topic of how
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280]   to learn.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680]   I ask you this question.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.760]   During the course of your formal education, were you ever given a course or a lecture
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.400]   even, a single lecture, on how to learn or perhaps how to study?
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.040]   Were you ever given tools of learning that you could apply throughout your entire lifetime?
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.760]   Did a professor share those secrets with you?
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.060]   For most of us, the answer is no.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.160]   And that's for a number of reasons.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.280]   First, of course, the entirety of the way that formal academic instruction is conducted
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.740]   assumes the need for an expert.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.240]   So most of the time when you are presented with a problem, you might very easily revert
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.000]   back to the idea of school.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.200]   I need to go and find an expert.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.840]   I need to go and find a teacher to teach me and to show me these things from the front
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   of the room.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000]   Now, there's a place for teachers.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   There's a place for experts.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   I make my living as an expert teacher.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040]   But I want to equip you to go beyond me.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.880]   I want to equip you to go beyond almost any teacher with some ideas on learning for yourself.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   Although there are times at which you need a teacher, some of the most valuable learning
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   can be done without a specific teacher, especially in the types of things that we discuss here
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.200]   on Radical Personal Finance, especially in your own pursuit of a rich life and financial
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.440]   freedom.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.000]   One of the most important tools of learning that you have is your own personal experience.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.420]   There are many things in your own life that you would count as wins, and there are things
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.960]   in your own life that you would count as failures.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.200]   But when looking to the future, if you will analyze the data from your own history of
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.360]   wins and failures, if you'll analyze that data, you can do a better job in the future.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   And you can turn those experiences of failure into valuable lessons for the future.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.620]   In fact, those experiences of failure, because they are probably very emotionally charged
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.640]   for you, will give you the lessons that will keep you out of the ditch in the future.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.240]   Personally, I have a long series of these financial failures, things in my own life
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   that have been very painful, big mistakes.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   I've shared a few of them here and there, but some of those mistakes are things that
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   I'm embarrassed to even speak out loud.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   Foolish, foolish decisions.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.360]   Sometimes I do things and only in hindsight do I realize how foolish a certain action
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.820]   was.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.440]   But once I make that mistake, as long as I study it, process it, and learn from it,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   there's a good chance I won't repeat it in the future.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.800]   I'll share one humorous anecdote to give an example of how deep these lessons go.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.720]   When I was in high school, I worked each summer at a summer job, and I had the task of saving
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.360]   money from that summer job to cover some of my expenses over the course of the year.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.680]   Most of that money was allocated towards personal spending without any direction from my parents,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.480]   but some of that money was allocated toward my school expenses.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.120]   My father and I had a deal when I was in high school that I could go to a private school
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.920]   if I would contribute $100 a month towards my own education.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.360]   That was $100 a month during the course of the school year.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   That came out to $700-$900 a year.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.320]   Not a big bill, but it was not insignificant.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.880]   And generally over the course of the summer, I was earning somewhere between $10-$13 an
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.440]   hour if memory serves.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.500]   And so over the course of the summer, I could earn about $3,000 if I worked a full-time
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.240]   job for most of the summer.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:44.160]   One summer, it came time for me to pay my dad my first monthly bill for my school tuition,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.480]   and I didn't have very much money in my bank account.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   And this was quite a surprise to me because I was used to, at the end of the summer, coming
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.240]   to a place where I had plenty of money.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.480]   I had several thousand dollars in the bank.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.880]   But this particular end of the summer, I didn't have much money, and I had not paid any attention
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.480]   to my money.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.760]   Well, this was, of course, quite embarrassing because I had a deal.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   I was behind on money.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.400]   I didn't have the money to pay my bills.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.240]   And so my dad forced me to go and do, in essence, a forensic audit of my finances.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.960]   And what I learned was very sobering.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.360]   In short, what had happened was I had spent all of my money at the local convenience store,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.820]   at a gas station that was near my summer job.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.400]   And I was pretty bored at this particular summer job, so I would go to that gas station
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.760]   quite frequently.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   I would generally, I found out afterward, go there two or three times a day.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.800]   I would go in the morning and get some coffee, sometimes get something to eat.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.120]   I might go at lunchtime, and this particular gas station had some of that yummy hot fried
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   food.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.640]   I think they had some delicious chicken wings.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.660]   And I would often buy some wings or some other food and perhaps a drink or a bag of chips
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.160]   or whatever the thing was.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.400]   And then sometimes in the afternoon, on my afternoon break, I would go by, or on my way
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.960]   home I would go by.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.320]   And what I found was, by the end of the summer, I had blown perhaps half of my earnings at
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   that stupid convenience store.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   I was broke for that entire school year, and it was not fun being broke.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.560]   It was a huge, huge deal.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.360]   That lesson sank in very deeply to the point that today I'm generally allergic to convenience
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   stores.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.640]   I must confess that from time to time I do buy a cup of coffee, but I cannot remember
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.040]   the time, the last time, that I've purchased anything other than a cup of coffee at a gas
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.000]   station or convenience store.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.360]   But because I'm so sensitive to this, I have watched many people who don't have very much
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:00.400]   money spend a lot of money at a convenience store.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.040]   Now I point that out to you.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.680]   If you're looking for where your money may be going, take a look at the convenience store.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   But I point it out to you as an example of a lesson that has served me very well that
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.800]   I learned the hard way.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:23.140]   But I only learned it when somebody came along and forced me to pay attention.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:30.560]   I don't think I would have had the awareness of my finances to actually figure out what
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.720]   had happened if my dad hadn't forced me to go back and do a forensic accounting and try
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.120]   to figure out where all of the money that I earned went.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   That was the exercise.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.960]   I had to go back and figure out how much money I had earned, and then I had to figure out
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   where it went.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.120]   Now of course there was a lot of money missing in that analysis.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.440]   I wasn't a good record keeper in those days.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   But I did figure out that that convenience store was the primary culprit.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   Now that's just a simple and hopefully mildly humorous example of a high school student's
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.960]   financial stupidity.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.280]   But there have been a lot of other lessons that I have learned.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.680]   And I'm wiser today because I've paid attention to those lessons.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   The problem is those are my lessons.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.080]   Those are the lessons from my own actions and activities.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.120]   And my lessons can't be your lessons.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.280]   I can share them with you, but you have your own lessons.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:42.680]   And you need to learn how to pay attention to your own lessons of life and let them help
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.600]   you to become wiser.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.120]   And I think this is a major problem that we face in our world today.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.880]   I already pointed out one of the errors.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.640]   Most of us have not learned how to learn.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.140]   It seems silly if I point it out, and humbling because it's true.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.960]   But very rarely have we ever learned how to learn.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.320]   I've frequently referenced one of my most useful books, Mortimer Adler's How to Read
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.460]   a Book.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.720]   Very rarely, once we've learned the basic mechanics of reading, very rarely were we
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.520]   ever taught how to read.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.960]   Or another example would be how to study.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   Have you ever taken a course on how to study effectively?
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.920]   One of the things that I find amazing is the amount of time in academic studies that we
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.960]   spend taking tests and studying, and yet very rarely have any of us actually taken a course
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.440]   or a seminar or read a book on how to study.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.280]   What about how to speak or how to listen?
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.200]   Mortimer Adler has another book, How to Speak and How to Listen.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.440]   It's quite good about how to actually speak effectively, how to listen effectively.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.880]   And then learning, how to actually learn.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.000]   As I've grown older and I've observed this deficiency that I didn't really know how to
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.920]   learn and I didn't really know how I learned, I started studying the topic.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.440]   I've gained immense valuable information by learning how to learn, learning the techniques
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.760]   of learning and also the techniques of how I particularly learn my own personal learning
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   style.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.640]   And I'll share with you a few simple suggestions that I hope will help you to learn from your
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:32.600]   own financial experiences and the experiences of others so that you can make wise decisions.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.640]   Because your ability to live a rich life and to build financial freedom will be dependent
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:46.320]   on your ability to make wise decisions and to follow through on the actions associated
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.560]   with those decisions.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.760]   Number one, pay attention to life.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.960]   Pay attention to your own life and the lives of others.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.200]   First your own life.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.000]   Notice what's happening in your own life.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.880]   Observe the things that are happening in your own life.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.000]   Observe the state of your bank account.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.360]   Pay attention to your net worth.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.040]   Pay attention to your spending habits.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.700]   See what's happening with your job.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.000]   Pay attention to how you do your job and how effective you are at it.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.680]   Pay attention to your life.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.560]   Pay attention to the relationships in your life.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.060]   Pay attention to the stresses and the triggers in your life.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.240]   When you find yourself earning a lot of money, pay attention to why.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   When you find yourself not earning a lot of money, pay attention to why.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.360]   It's not an accident.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.400]   You can notice and figure out and discern why these things are happening.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.000]   When you wind up with significant expenses, pay attention to why.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.120]   What's happening?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.040]   If you'll just pay attention, then you can figure out plans and ideas for how to minimize
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.960]   those expenses.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.280]   Pay attention to the lives of others.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.320]   Take an interest in others.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.080]   Take an interest in speaking to other people and learning from their experiences.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.840]   Yes, it's valuable to learn from your own experience, but if you can avoid some mistakes
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:27.640]   by learning from the experiences of others, it's a very wise way to approach life.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.440]   But very rarely do we take the time to ask other people how they came to be where they
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.520]   are.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.840]   So observe the behavior of other people if you don't want to ask them.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.920]   Observe the behavior of the person who is popular.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.780]   Observe the behavior of the person who is rich.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.200]   Observe the behavior of the person who is an outcast.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.760]   Observe the behavior of the person who is poor.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.640]   Try to identify those things that you can see that might possibly be contributing to
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.400]   their social status or to their financial position.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.480]   Now, that's only a hypothesis, but you can test your hypothesis with other people, with
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:16.160]   other circumstances, and try to see if your hypothesis proves true.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.960]   Pay attention to life.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:26.680]   Two, make time for contemplation and consider carefully the situations of life.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.140]   What's happening and why is it happening?
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:37.500]   In our very busy, very frenetic, very loud world, it seems more and more challenging
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.800]   to make time for contemplation and consideration.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.320]   We're all guilty of it.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.520]   When's the last time you heard somebody say, "I'm bored"?
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.260]   It's almost impossible to be bored in our modern era, because we fill our lives at every
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.040]   moment with activity, and we have no shortage of ways to amuse ourselves.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:12.160]   And yet, in our busyness and in our access to information, our ability to use the circumstances
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.360]   of our lives and generate wisdom seems to be increasingly limited.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:26.680]   I think it's important to make time for contemplation, quiet time, to consider what's going on.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.040]   Make time for quiet conversation with the people who are in your life, who know you
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:41.200]   well, who can understand the circumstances of your life, and talk about important things.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.920]   Number three, ask yourself questions.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:51.680]   A great question has a way of leading you to a solution.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.240]   Frequently, we bumble past opportunities to ask ourselves questions, and we don't give
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.040]   our brains the opportunity to analyze the information and give us an answer.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.160]   One of the most valuable suggestions I could make to you is simply this.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:15.620]   Ask yourself a question in writing on the top of a journal page, and then brainstorm
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.400]   some solutions to that question.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.240]   Brainstorm solutions to your problem.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.040]   Do this in writing if possible so that you can see your own thinking.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   But it can be very simple.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.360]   If you're broke, ask yourself this, "Why am I broke?"
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.280]   If you're broke and you write down at the top of a page, "Why am I broke?"
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.720]   And then you sit there and you write down a dozen or two answers, I'll bet that you'll
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:48.740]   get 80 to 90% of the reasons why you're broke right on that piece of paper.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.100]   You don't need me to come along and identify why you're broke.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.220]   You already know it.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.060]   So write it down on a piece of paper, and then figure out the answers.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.080]   Now of course you could take a more positive tack if you like.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.900]   You could start with, "How can I make more money?"
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.220]   And if you write that at the top of a page, you'll program your brain to start looking
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.780]   for money-making opportunities.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.980]   Brainstorm as many answers as you can, and even if you only come up with two or three,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.340]   you will radically transform how you see the world.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.140]   Because for the rest of that day and the rest of that week, you'll look around and you'll
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.860]   be thinking about that question, "How can I make more money?"
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.500]   So ask yourself questions.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.780]   Brainstorm solutions to your problems and do it in writing.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:44.340]   And four, be humble enough to admit when you're wrong and when you need to change.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:52.180]   The reason we often don't want to write down those questions and answers is our pride.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.340]   We frequently don't want to admit the mistakes that we've made.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.300]   The problem is you're only deluding yourself.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:08.260]   Everyone else can see those mistakes that you've made.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.180]   You're the last one to see it if you're too proud to face it honestly.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:20.460]   I've been struck by this in looking at pictures or videos of myself.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:29.380]   We all have an idea of how we're perceived, but in the stark light of a photo or a video
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.220]   camera, we can see how we actually look.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.580]   And we might have this perception of how we are, but our perception is not the truth.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.700]   The truth is everyone sees you the way that you look on video.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.300]   Everyone sees you the way that you look in a picture.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.340]   That's the truth.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.780]   The problem is not with what's actually true.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.340]   The problem is the difference in your inability or my inability to look at the actual facts.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.820]   So the same thing with some of these questions.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:10.500]   If you're wrong, be humble enough to admit when you're wrong and need to change.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.140]   There's no problem.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.260]   You'll be the last one to know.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.900]   But if you'll be humble and admit when you're wrong and a course of action and need to change,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   go for it.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.100]   That can be as simple as recognizing something like this.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.220]   Credit cards have never been a blessing for me.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.940]   I'm going to stop using them.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.260]   Well, you'd have to admit you were wrong to do that.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:37.100]   But yet if you do so, it can lead to a much brighter future.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.100]   You can either experience a small moment of pain to admit the mistakes that you've made
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:48.900]   and humble yourself enough to accept them and then enjoy the long future ahead of you
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.940]   without making those mistakes.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:20:00.380]   Or you can continue on in pride and reap the consistent error of your ways for a very long
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.140]   period of time.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.660]   So be humble enough to change course.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.420]   If something's not working, just admit it.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.180]   It's not working and I need to change.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:16.420]   And if you'll continue that process of paying attention to life, making time for contemplation,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.700]   asking yourself questions, brainstorming solutions, and then admitting when you need to change
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   and actually doing it based upon some of those solutions you've found, you'll come up with
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:36.500]   good solutions, good things to try that will lead you closer and closer to the direction
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:42.940]   of your dreams, to the direction of the highest ideal.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.900]   In closing, I want to simply encourage you with this.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:56.540]   Your mistakes, the failures are wonderful learning opportunities.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:07.020]   They don't feel good when you're in the middle of them, but in time they provide you with
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:13.700]   the lessons that you need to live a successful life.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:19.620]   When I think back over the course of my life, I'm grateful for the failures.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:26.500]   I'm grateful for the mistakes because those things have taught me some very valuable lessons.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.580]   I don't want to repeat them, but I see the benefit.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.180]   I'm able to do what I do in sharing with you about money largely because of the many mistakes
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.780]   that I've made.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:47.260]   At the very least, it should give me a bit of humility in my tone that makes you willing
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.140]   to listen to me.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.260]   If I were an arrogant know-it-all and didn't share with you some of the errors, you'd never
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.580]   listen to me.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:00.420]   So at the very least, they've done that, but in reality, it's far more.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.960]   Those mistakes have given me compassion.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.260]   Those mistakes have given me lessons.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:13.560]   And by watching my own mistakes and the mistakes of others, I've learned enough to have something
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.140]   useful to share with you.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.660]   So embrace your mistakes.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.180]   Sometimes you win, and sometimes you learn.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.900]   It's a much better philosophy of life than trying to ignore them.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   [MUSIC - "RAIN"]
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.900]   Rain, I see you're running with the blues.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.900]   You've done that thing you do to my parade.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.900]   It's a sin.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.900]   You got me swimming in regret.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.900]   You keep finding ways to get me looking back.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:29.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:50.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:47.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.900]   I'm not going to let you go.

[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   I'm not going to let you go.

[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.900]   I'm not going to let you go.

[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.900]   I'm not going to let you go.
