[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about Social
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.480]   Security, our national pension fund that I didn't really believe in when I was in my 20s or my 30s,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.040]   but now that I'm going to be 45 next year, I'm thinking, hey, maybe Social Security is going
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.240]   to be there for us in full actually, and maybe all this time worrying about saving and investing our
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.640]   pennies and dollars was for naught, or at the very least, we shouldn't have been worrying so much.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.440]   And the reason why I believe this is because the cost of living adjustment in 2022 is going up a
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:50.800]   whopping 5.9 percent. 5.9 percent folks, that's an impressive increase and that'll translate to an
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.480]   additional $92 a month on average for the average retiree. Now that turns out to be $1,657 a month,
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.800]   or $19,884 a year from Social Security until death. The average person would need about
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.320]   $500,000 in capital returning 4% to generate the average Social Security benefit of $19,884 a year.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.920]   In other words, the average American retiring is a half a millionaire. And I also believe,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.440]   because the average is a half a millionaire, the vast majority of Financial Samurai listeners and
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.880]   readers will retire as millionaires or multi-millionaires by their mid to late 60s.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.160]   All this time, I thought that Social Security would not pay out its fully promised amount.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   The pension fund is currently underfunded by about 22 percent. So I was thinking, well, we should all
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.920]   at least lop off 22 percent from our expectations. But for it to now pay such a huge,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.040]   high cost of living adjustment is pretty baffling, since it's underfunded. A larger payment reduces
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.960]   the plan's financial health. The Social Security Board of Trustees recently admitted the trust fund
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.040]   will be depleted by 2034, a year earlier than estimated in 2020. So if you jack up the COLA
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.120]   by 5.9 percent the following year, it's probably going to get depleted by two, three, four more
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   months. It just depends on what inflation will do next year and also how much the maximum income
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.280]   will be taxable under Social Security. Well, I got the answer. So the maximum income to be subject
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   to the tax will increase from $142,800 in 2021 to $147,000 in 2022. So is that 5.9 percent? Does
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   that match the COLA increase? No, it does not. Quick math dictates that that income increase is
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   only 2.94 percent. So again, another mismatch. Amazing. Great for retirees, the boomers, who are
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.920]   also the wealthiest, wealthiest generation in our history. And not so great for the millennials,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   the Gen Xers, the Gen Zers, and so forth. Think about it, folks. If the government wanted to
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.120]   improve the financial health of Social Security, it would at least raise the maximum taxable income
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.720]   limit by 5.9 percent as well. And if they really, really wanted to improve the health of Social
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.360]   Security, they would raise the income tax limit further, let's say 10 to 20 percent to $157,000
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.440]   to $171,000 while capping maximum benefits. And that probably would pass the mustard. Those
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.680]   critical folks who are just saying it's all a big Ponzi scheme, can you really tell too much
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.920]   if your income limit goes to $157,000, $171,000? I mean, you can tell a little bit from each
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.640]   paycheck, but it's not that drastic of a difference. We've got to do something if we
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   want to make the system whole. And I think that would have been an easy, easy way to help the
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.760]   system instead of hurt it. Now, just to recap what the Social Security tax is just for our own
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   education, because these numbers, you know, it's not like you can know them off the top of your
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.800]   head. Well, Social Security tax rate is really 12.4 percent, half of which 6.2 percent is withheld
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   from the employer, and 6.2 percent of which is withheld from the employee. Yay, go team, right?
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   Then there is the Medicare tax rate, which is 2.9 percent, and half of it, or 1.45 percent,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.840]   is withheld from the employer, and half of it, 1.45 percent, is withheld from the employee.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.640]   Therefore, for regular employees, you will pay 7.45 percent of your income up to the maximum limit
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   of $147,000 in 2022 in FICA taxes. And FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.760]   and it consists of the Social Security tax and the Medicare tax that automatically gets deducted
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.000]   from your paycheck. Now, good thing about the Social Security tax is that it's capped at $147,000.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:15.760]   So, the maximum you'd pay in Social Security tax per year, well, in 2022, that is, is $9,114,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:24.720]   right? $147,000 times 6.2 percent. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there's no maximum income limit
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.200]   on Medicare tax. You'll just have to keep on paying the 1.45 percent Medicare tax for as high
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.880]   as your income will go. And then there's an additional Medicare tax of 0.9 percent for high
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.760]   income taxpayers with earned income of more than $200,000 and $250,000 for married couples filing
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.240]   jointly. So, these figures are interesting, and I think it coincides with what I think is the ideal
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.200]   income for maximum happiness, or where happiness doesn't increase any further. And that's about
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.200]   $200,000 to $250,000 per individual and $250,000 to $300,000 per couple up to a family of four,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.400]   so two children. Those are the income ranges where you get the most bang for your buck,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.720]   and your tax rates aren't really going up at all. Now, President Biden has announced that he's going
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.360]   to raise taxes for individuals making over $400,000 and $450,000 for couples. Therefore,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.160]   if you're in the $200,000 to $250,000 range per person or $250,000 to $300,000 range as a married
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.120]   couple, you should be good to go. Now, I never thought the government would steal from the poor
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.040]   to give to the rich, you know, with all this rhetoric saying, "We must help the impoverished,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.240]   the less fortunate," and so forth. I would think that the government would always be taking from
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.680]   the rich and redistributing to the less rich or to the poor. But if you click over to my post,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.040]   you can see the percentage of US household wealth by age of generations median cohort.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:08.400]   And you'll see that baby boomers own about 55 to 58% of all the wealth in America. Then there's
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:15.520]   the Gen Xers that own about 17 to 19% of all the wealth. And then there are the millennials who
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.240]   own about 5% of all the wealth. And it makes sense. It makes sense that baby boomers own more
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.760]   of the percentage of wealth because they're older and they've had more time to save and invest.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.360]   Think about how wealthy you'd be if you consistently saved and invested 20 plus percent
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   of your income for 40 plus years in the biggest bull market ever. You'd be very wealthy. At least
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.160]   the cohort would be very wealthy. So in other words, by raising the COLA by 5.9% to the already
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.280]   wealthiest generation who get to accept Social Security, we are taking money away from the less
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.360]   wealthy generations and giving it to the wealthiest generation. Therefore, with this logic,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.680]   you want to one, retire wealthy yourself because then you can take care of yourself. And maybe the
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.320]   government is going to hook you up as well because the government, if you think about it, is run by
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.480]   some of the wealthiest people in the country. Giving a 5.9% COLA increase to baby boomers
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   is like elite private universities with tens of billions of dollars in endowment funds giving
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:31.040]   full ride scholarships to Barack Obama's and Donald Trump's kids. They're already very,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.640]   very wealthy. Instead, wouldn't it be better for universities to give scholarships to poor families
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.160]   struggling to get out of the poverty cycle? I think we'd all say yes and the rich would say yes.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.520]   But what the rich do is very different from what they say. Really pay attention to what they do
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   with their money versus what they say. We saw in the latest college rankings by Forbes, Harvard's
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.840]   share of Pell students is just 12% versus 25% on average for students enrolled in Forbes's top 600
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:09.280]   colleges. And the same ratios are very consistent with a lot of these elite and wealthy institutions.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.440]   And so, given the government is run by the rich, taking from the poor to give to the richest
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.280]   generation is pretty par for the course. Therefore, you've got to look out for yourself.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.840]   Put on your own oxygen mask first before you can potentially help others. We need to rely on the
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:35.440]   new three-legged stool for retirement. And those three legs are your taxed advantage retirement
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.200]   accounts. So your 401ks, IRAs, Roth IRAs and so forth. Then your taxable investment accounts,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.720]   those investments that generate passive income that you can live off of. And then finally,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   your side hustles, those odds and ends jobs that you do in retirement or while you're working.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.200]   And maybe you start something entrepreneurial. There are so many ways to make
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.640]   extra money, more money, different types of money nowadays. And to contrast, the old three-legged
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   stool for retirement, they consisted of pension, social security, and your tax advantage retirement
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   accounts. So if you also have a pension and you have social security as well, those three-legged
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.760]   stools turn into five-legged stools if you're depending on yourself. And you should be very
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:34.160]   stable, very sturdy in retirement. Alright, folks, this wraps up another episode on Financial Samurai.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.280]   I want to leave you with the maximum amount of social security benefits you can potentially
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   receive starting in 2022. And that number is $3,345 a month, up from $3,148 a month. $3,345
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.800]   a month, folks, that's a lot of money. If you've paid off your house, you drive your normal car,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.200]   you don't need a new car, you eat normally, you don't need to go on fancy vacations. I think most
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.000]   people in retirement can live off more than $38,000 a year. Couldn't you? I definitely think
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.800]   I could. So even if we have to lop off 20% from $3,345, you're still going to get about $2,700
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.720]   a month from social security. But just mentally don't count on it being there for you while you're
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.560]   in your 60s and 70s and beyond. If you don't count on something, then if you get that something,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.880]   you're just going to feel that great upside surprise. So if you're feeling a little bit
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.800]   stressed, or a little bit fatigued about saving and investing, well, I think we should all feel
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.360]   a little bit better that social security, if the government doesn't blow it up, should do
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.640]   what it's supposed to do and take care of us in inflationary environments. I'm curious to know
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.200]   how the government is going to make the system whole. We're just gonna have to wait and find out.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.040]   Thanks so much, everyone. And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a five star review and
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.640]   some positive comments. It's what keeps me going. Transcribed by https://otter.ai
