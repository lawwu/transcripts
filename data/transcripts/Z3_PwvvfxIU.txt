[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   I'm here with Mr. Beast, the brilliant mastermind
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.560]   behind some of the most popular videos ever created.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.720]   Do you think you'll ever make a video
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.480]   that gets one billion views?
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.680]   - I think maybe one of the videos we've already made
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.520]   might get a billion views.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.400]   - Which one do you think?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   - Probably like the squid game video with enough time.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680]   I mean, it's only a year old and it's already on 300 million
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.160]   or some of the newer ones we've done
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.640]   have gotten like 100 million views in a month.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.160]   So those four are projected over 10 years
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.520]   'cause YouTube's not going anywhere.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.360]   Probably one of those.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.480]   Over time, they don't necessarily plateau.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   - That's interesting.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   We're literally jumping right into it.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.440]   I love it.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.280]   It's good.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.720]   So I'm a firm believer that it's much easier
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   to hypothetically get 10 million views on one video
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.520]   than 100,000 on 100.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280]   And part of why it's much easier in my opinion
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.840]   is like if you make a really good video,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.960]   it's just so evergreen and it never dies.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   'Cause YouTube, when you open up YouTube
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.360]   and look at the videos,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.600]   they're just serving you whatever
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.440]   they think you'll like the best.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.320]   And so if you just make a great video
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.160]   and it's constantly just above every other video,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   even two years down the road,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   then they'll just keep serving it and never stop.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.040]   Which is why it's much easier to make one great video
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600]   than a bunch of mediocre ones.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.040]   - What about one billion subscribers?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   You've passed PewDiePie's
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.960]   the most subscribed to YouTube channel.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.600]   When do you think you get a billion?
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.040]   - Let me do some math real quick.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.760]   So around 120.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   - So you think about this?
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.440]   - No, I don't, honestly.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.200]   'Cause one thing you'll find
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.600]   if you wanna gain subscribers,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.560]   if you wanna get views,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.800]   if you wanna make money,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.840]   almost any metric in this video creation space,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.200]   if you want something,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.160]   it all comes back to,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.800]   okay, well then just make great videos.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.360]   So instead of focusing
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   on all these arbitrary vanity metrics,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.800]   I just kind of focus on the one thing
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.920]   that gets me all that,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.160]   which is make good videos.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.960]   But I do think we will one day hit a billion subscribers.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   I don't have a plan on going anywhere.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.840]   Even though we're only on 120 million right now
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.880]   on the main channel,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.320]   I think we're doing around 10 million a month now
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.640]   and YouTube just, yeah,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.000]   I just don't see it going anywhere.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.320]   And I don't see any reason
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.600]   why I'd ever get burnt out or quit.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.880]   So I think with enough time, yes.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240]   - I wanted to ask you those family-friendly questions
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.440]   before I go to the dark questions.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280]   So now--
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.960]   - Oh, we have dark questions.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.240]   But if you wanted to hook them,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   you would start off with the dark questions.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.680]   That's how you get them.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.800]   - Okay, well, let me ask you about a Twitter poll you posted,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   a $10,000 death poll.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   You tweeted, "If someone offered you $10,000,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.020]   but if you take it, a random person on Earth dies,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.200]   would you take the $10,000?"
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.120]   And 45% of people said yes.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.960]   That's, at least at the time I checked,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.080]   850,000 people committing murder
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.200]   for just $8.5 billion in total.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.080]   So what do you learn about human nature from that?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.840]   - That's a good question.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440]   Honestly, this is like late at night
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.280]   when I threw that up too.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.720]   I was just like, huh, this will be a funny thing.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   I assumed it'd be 90% no and 10% yes,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.580]   but there are a lot of serious people.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.320]   For you guys listening, I just did this random Twitter poll
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.520]   where I was like, "Would you take 10 grand
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200]   if it meant someone random in the world died?"
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.400]   And a lot of the replies on the tweet were like,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   "Hell yeah, why not?"
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   And I was just not expecting that.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.740]   And so I don't really know.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.600]   I mean, I feel like your take would be better than mine.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.560]   - Was it disturbing to you, surprising to you?
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.600]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.880]   But obviously a lot of people were trolling,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   but when you read through those replies,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000]   I do think like 10% of them were like dead serious.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   - Well, I think sometimes the trolling and the lulls
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.160]   reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to admit
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.320]   about the darker aspects of our nature.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.520]   So I don't know if you listened
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.880]   to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   He has a episode on painful attainment,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.840]   which he describes throughout history
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   how humans have been really attracted
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   to watching the suffering of others.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.400]   So public executions, all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.880]   And he believes that's in all of us.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   That, for example, if something like a YouTube
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.280]   or a different platform streamed a public execution
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.540]   or streamed the torture of another human being,
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.880]   a lot of people would say that's deeply unethical,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.200]   but they would still tune in and watch.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.720]   And that we're attracted to that drama,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   and especially the most extreme versions of that drama.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.440]   And so I think part of the lulls
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.880]   reveal something that's actually true in that poll.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.680]   - Your answer's so much better than mine.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.360]   - Do you think about that, maybe even with the Squid Game?
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.640]   So I think, how many views does the Squid Game
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   currently have, 300 million?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.020]   - Yeah, something like that. - Something like this?
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.020]   So just imagine, thought experiment,
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.080]   how many views that video would get
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.480]   if it was real, Squid Game.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   - Yeah, assuming YouTube was like,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.480]   we'll turn a blind eye, we won't take it down.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.120]   Yeah, I mean, obviously, it'd probably have
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.000]   billions of views.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   - How do you think you'll die,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   and do you think it'll be during a video?
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   - Probably doing something dumb like going to space
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   when I'm older, or trying to go to Mars,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.400]   or something like that.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.360]   I know for a fact it won't be on a video.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.000]   Every video we do, we have safety experts
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.920]   and stuff like that, so it's not really risk.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.360]   But yeah, I could see myself,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.320]   after a million people go to Mars or something like that,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   I'd probably be like, you know what, let's go.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.520]   And something like that, maybe.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   - So not in the name of a video, just for the holiday?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.200]   - Heck no.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.360]   - Are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos?
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.520]   You just went to Antarctica.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   I mean, you're putting yourself in the line
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.280]   a little bit, right?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.720]   - Of course, but we've had that video
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.680]   on the works for three years,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.480]   and then we consult with tons of experts,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.720]   radar the entire path we're gonna walk beforehand
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   to see if there's crevasses.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.480]   So we know there's no crevasses,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.280]   we do training, we consult with experts,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.000]   and we have survival guides there with us,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.720]   and monitor the weather and everything.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.020]   So it's like, any variable where we could get harmed,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.320]   we just pre-plan for it.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.400]   Same thing with buried alive.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.860]   Like, I had David Blaine spent a week underground,
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.240]   and so I consulted with him,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   and consulted with basically anyone
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.960]   who ever buried themselves alive.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.080]   You know, the coffin we used to bury me,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.980]   we did so many tests.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.360]   Like, that coffin was buried 10 times before I was,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.020]   you know, for way longer than 50 hours.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.440]   It tested the airflow and everything,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   to the point where I was safer in that coffin underground
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.000]   than I was above ground.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.240]   Like, so we just tend to just not leave anything
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.540]   up to chance, you know?
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.720]   - Another strange question then.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.980]   So you recorded these videos to yourself,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.960]   you know, five years, 10 years from now.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Have you recorded a video that's to be released
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.360]   once you die?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   - Well, first off, I am just glad
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.800]   that not every one of your questions
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.560]   have to do with, like, views or things like that.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   It's nice getting different questions.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   So this is good.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.280]   No, seriously-- - It's a little dark.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.840]   It's a little dark. - No, no, but it's fine,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.120]   because a lot of people just be like,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   "How much money do you make?"
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.320]   You know, it's just something I just,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   everything's always about money now,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.120]   when people talk to me.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   So it's nice.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.200]   But for the videos I've made,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.820]   for you guys who probably don't follow me too closely,
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.460]   when I had 8,000 subscribers and I was a teenager,
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.800]   I filmed a bunch of videos
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.560]   and scheduled them years in the future.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.320]   And I said, I filmed one where I was like,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.160]   "High me in a year."
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.640]   And the video went up a year later.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.160]   And it was just like, "Hey, I think you'll have
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.240]   "100,000 subscribers."
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.280]   And then I did one where I was like,
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.720]   "High me in five years."
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.580]   I was like, "Hey, in five years,
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.720]   "I think you'll have a million."
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.340]   And then one that hasn't come out yet,
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.540]   but comes out in two years,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.320]   is what was "High me in 10 years."
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   And I tried to predict 10 years later
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.880]   how many subs I'd have.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.920]   That's what he's referring to.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.680]   And yes, there are some that are scheduled
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.440]   like 20 years in the future.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.680]   And so if I don't die, I'll just move them up.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.960]   And I remember, 'cause I filmed these though,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.520]   like seven years ago.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.760]   But it was, I remember saying a line like,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.600]   "You know, if I'm dead,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.280]   "then I'm currently just in a coffin."
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.600]   And like, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000]   And because the only way the video would go up
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.500]   is if I'm not alive.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.800]   And if I'm not alive,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.960]   then I won't be able to push back the schedule upload date.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.780]   So it will go public automatically.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.160]   And so, yeah, I have a couple of those.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.200]   Like if I knew I was gonna die of like cancer or something,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.840]   and I had like three months to live,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.100]   I would vlog every day.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.240]   I'd film so many videos,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.120]   and then I would just schedule upload a video a week
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.280]   for like the next five years.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.680]   So it's like I'm still alive.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.760]   And I would completely act like I'm still alive
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.720]   and everything.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.760]   And I think something like that would be cool.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.000]   I don't know why, but I've fantasized,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.820]   not fantasized, but I've dreamt about that a lot.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.800]   Like, I don't know,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.520]   if I only had 30 days to live, what would I do?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   And for me, I would try to make like a decade's worth
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.360]   of content and schedule upload it
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.480]   so they automatically go public in the future.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.960]   And so it's just like I never died.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.240]   I'm just there.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.900]   - Yeah, it's a kind of immortality,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.040]   but it's also a kind of troll on the concept of time.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.880]   - Yeah.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.760]   - That you can die in the physical space,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.900]   but persist in the digital space.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.140]   I actually, I recorded a video like that
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.000]   'cause I had some concerns,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.640]   and I just thought it's also a good exercise to do.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.160]   A video would like to be released if I die.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.560]   And it was actually a really interesting exercise.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   - It's cool.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.760]   Like it shows like what you really care about.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.320]   I guess it's like writing a will.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.160]   But when you're younger,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.320]   you don't think about that kind of stuff.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   - Exactly, mine was just dumb.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.560]   - Yeah.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.120]   - Like I'm bones in a coffin.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.160]   - Yeah.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.820]   - Yours was probably so serious.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.760]   - No, it's fun actually.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.280]   What you realize is like there's no point
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   to be serious at this point.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.400]   It's a weird thing.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.340]   I guess you've done this,
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.080]   but it's a weird thing to address the world
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.360]   when you, the physically you, is no longer there.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.040]   So like, you know this would only be released
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.080]   if you're no longer there.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.920]   - Exactly.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.740]   - That's a weird exercise.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.580]   - You know what's funny?
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.920]   Like all the people listening to this,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   you know, we're probably the only two people
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.560]   that have made videos for when we die.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.160]   It's like such a niche thing.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.280]   And the fact that we're bonding over it's kind of funny.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.080]   - I think people should think about doing that.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.160]   It's not just about YouTube.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.200]   It's also social media.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.680]   Just think about it.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.720]   Like there's gonna be a last tweet
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.520]   and a last, I don't know, Facebook post,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.400]   a last Instagram post.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.880]   And yeah, I feel like there's some aspects
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.120]   that's meditative to just even considering
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.320]   making a post like that.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.260]   And also it's a way for the people that love you
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.140]   to kind of like celebrate.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.780]   - Do you think that would help them cope or not?
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.740]   Like if someone randomly watching this did film a video,
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.180]   you know, for if they accidentally died
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.020]   in some freak accident to be given to their family,
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.460]   do you think that would, and it was like a genuine.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.620]   - I think it would really help.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.540]   I mean, it depends.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.380]   Because like--
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.200]   - Like how would you even intro that?
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.180]   Like, hey mom, if you're seeing this,
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.620]   you know, it means I'm probably dead.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.460]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.300]   That's how you intro it.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.120]   (laughing)
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.960]   That's the opener.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.580]   - I just want you to know, yeah, I guess.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.540]   - Yeah, and I guess you could say it in a kind of funny way
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.580]   but, and just talk about the things
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.380]   that mean a lot to you.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.480]   'Cause otherwise you're at the risk
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.980]   of the last post you have is like,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.980]   like, I don't know, talking shit about like--
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.820]   - Donald's screwed up my order.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.640]   - McDonald's, exactly.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.480]   (laughing)
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.140]   - And then you're dead, that's it, 100 years.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.320]   - I don't know, I do recommend it.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.520]   It's like the Stoics meditate on death every day
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.100]   in the same way you kind of meditate on your death
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.380]   when you make a video like that.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.140]   'Cause it's actually not just even talking to yourself,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.740]   it's talking to the world.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.400]   And it like, for some reason, at least for me,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.160]   they made it very concrete that there's going to be an end.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.180]   And I'm like, it's almost, it's over for me.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.580]   If I'm making the video, it's over for me.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.020]   It's an interesting thought experiment.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.180]   I recommend people try it.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.020]   Okay, are you afraid of death, by the way?
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.560]   - Yes, I, it's hard because,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.380]   like, what if you just die
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.500]   and then you just see nothing forever, you know?
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   - Yeah, the nothingness.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.140]   - It just fades to blackness and you're just like that
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.500]   for trillions upon trillions to billions squared years.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.840]   And it's just, it's scary.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.220]   But also, before you're born,
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.620]   you don't remember those X amount of years either.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.260]   So that gives me a little comfort.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.460]   But no, it's definitely very scary.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.980]   Something I'd rather not think about until I'm like 80.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.380]   I'll deal with that problem then.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.100]   I don't know if I told you this,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.540]   but I'm kind of hopeful that someone like Elon
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.460]   or one of these like freak smart people
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.220]   would just like, be like, you know what, screw it.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.860]   I'm gonna figure out a way where we can slow down aging,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.140]   get it where, you know, we can live to be 200, 300 years old
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   and just like set their sights on that
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.740]   and then just kind of save us.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.460]   So it'd be really nice.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.960]   Like, it's almost absurd to think that in our lifetime,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.800]   they won't figure out a way
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.300]   to just even slightly slow down aging,
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.460]   where we could live to be like 120, 130.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.500]   And then that extra time,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.340]   they won't figure out some way
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.500]   where we could live to be 200.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.960]   Like, obviously not immortal,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.860]   but I don't see how in my lifetime,
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   the life expectancy doesn't just expand.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.180]   - But it also could be that the immortality is achieved
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.220]   in the digital realm.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.860]   Like, it could be long after you're gone
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.620]   as a Mr. Beast run by a Chad GPT type system.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.460]   - Exactly.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.740]   Yeah, that consumes everything I ever said,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.020]   everything I ever wrote.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.860]   I don't want that.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.860]   I don't wanna live.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.840]   What are you smart people out there figuring out?
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.200]   I'll keep you entertained,
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.620]   but I need you to figure out how to keep me alive.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.780]   Give me till 200.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.580]   That will make me happy.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.540]   - Well, that's funny.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.700]   Who owns the identity of Mr. Beast
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.740]   once the physical body is gone?
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.420]   Like, is it illegal to create another Mr. Beast
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.700]   that's Chad GPT based?
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.260]   I don't know what the laws are on that.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.100]   - Yeah.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.620]   I mean, once I'm dead, I don't care.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.460]   (laughs)
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.900]   - Well, you just said you did care.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.540]   I mean, there could be a AI,
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.860]   like many Mr. Beasts that are created after you're gone.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.700]   - Yeah.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.860]   I mean, that'd be cool to be able to like train up a model
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.620]   and let them loose so my content lives on, I guess.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.420]   - Yeah.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.420]   But it somehow feels like it diminishes
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.580]   the value you contribute.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.300]   - Yeah, it's inauthentic, but it's also,
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.260]   there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.300]   being necessary for its greatness.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.140]   - Yeah.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.900]   The second that thing starts spamming out videos,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.580]   the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.680]   and it's a money grab.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.300]   - If you ran YouTube for, how long should you run it?
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.140]   For a year, how would you change it?
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.100]   How would you improve it?
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.700]   - It's hard because, you know, obviously I'm biased
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.020]   'cause we're doing really well,
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.420]   but I feel like when I open up YouTube on my television,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.180]   I get the videos I wanna watch.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.820]   I don't know.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.300]   I don't ever open it and wonder like, what are these?
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.340]   What are these 10 videos on my homepage?
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.340]   When I click on a video, I don't ever wonder what these are.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.780]   And maybe it's 'cause I'm very adamant
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.100]   about like the kind of videos I watch
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.100]   and I try not to watch videos
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.580]   that I don't wanna get recommended more
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.900]   because that's how I think.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.700]   But I'm very happy with how it is at the moment.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.580]   I think one thing though that I just hate with the passion
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.740]   is the comment section on YouTube.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.740]   It's just so bad.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.860]   But I know that's not something
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860]   that's gonna 10X the growth of the platform.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.020]   But if you think about it, you go to Reddit to read comments
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.900]   and somehow, like, you know, usually the top 20 posts
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.180]   on a popular Reddit post are not spam.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.220]   Have you ever clicked on something
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.060]   on the front page of Reddit
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.460]   and then most upvoted reply to it is like,
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.940]   "Go check out my site right here."
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.100]   And it's like trying to scam you out of $1,000.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.740]   Yeah, I can't even think of one instance
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.580]   I've ever had that happen.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.500]   So like Reddit, it's so nice to click on posts
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.340]   and just see what people have to say.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.100]   And I almost wish like you had that same feeling
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.780]   when you read the comments on a YouTube video.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.660]   Instead, it's like, it's so many people
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.540]   just copy and pasting, so many bots
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.340]   that just grab the top comment for your previous video
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.180]   and paste it over.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.980]   So the top comments on every videos are the same.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.380]   And the things that break through that
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.660]   are just scammers trying to get you
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.300]   to give them $1,000 for a fake ad.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.340]   - That comment section is one of the most lively
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.420]   on the internet.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.540]   And so it'd be amazing if YouTube invested
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.300]   in creating an actual community,
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.100]   like where people could do high effort comments
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.980]   and be rewarded for it, like on Reddit.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.820]   - Yeah.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.660]   - Like actually write out a long thing.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.940]   - That would make me so happy.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.980]   'Cause like when I upload a video,
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.660]   I usually go to Twitter to see feedback.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.140]   Like I read my comments and I'll flip through newest,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.740]   but it's just, I feel like Reddit and Twitter
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.140]   just give me so much better filtered feedback.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.980]   Especially now that with Twitter Blue,
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.660]   because people pay $8 a month,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.700]   I've noticed like any tweets I get from verified users now,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.340]   they're usually not just garbage troll takes.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.100]   Like these are people paying $8 a month.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.820]   Like they're usually relatively sensible.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.380]   And so it's been pretty nice.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.220]   Like after I upload a video,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.860]   I just go on the verified tab on Twitter
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.380]   and just see what people have to say.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.860]   And anyways, I live for the day that YouTube's like that.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.420]   - What do you think about Twitter?
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.820]   What do you think about all the fun activity
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.620]   happening recently since Elon bought Twitter?
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.500]   - I think he should make me CEO, like I tweeted.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.740]   (laughing)
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.340]   - Well, I should say sort of we had,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.940]   we just like a couple hours ago
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.100]   had a conversation with Elon
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.940]   and you guys said in exchange of some excellent ideas.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.620]   So yeah, I legitimately think,
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.020]   obviously you're exceptionally busy,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.900]   but I legitimately think it would be awesome
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.900]   if you somehow participate in the future of Twitter.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.100]   - Yeah, it would be fun.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.380]   - 'Cause there's so much possibility of different ideas.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.140]   First in the sort of the content,
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.020]   like dissemination, hosting,
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.220]   and all the different recommendations,
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.180]   like the search and discovery,
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.220]   all the things that YouTube does well.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.020]   I think the most exciting thing is
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.300]   he's willing to move fast.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.800]   And so I think there's gonna be a lot of interesting things
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.340]   that come out of it because he's just moving quick
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.260]   and a lot of these more mature platforms
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.340]   just take years to do the simplest stuff
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.620]   and they're very bureaucratic.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.140]   So it's gonna, I mean,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.820]   it'll be interesting to see which way it goes
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.280]   when you just kind of take a move quick, break things,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.700]   whatever type approach to social media.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.580]   I'm actually pretty curious
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.820]   to see what features he rolls out.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.060]   - So what would be your first act as Twitter CEO?
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.980]   - I can't spoil it.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.820]   - Okay.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.740]   - I gotta get hired.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.780]   (both laughing)
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.740]   - What do you think about video on the platform?
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.580]   - On Twitter?
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.500]   - Yeah, do you think that's an interesting,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.700]   or is it like messing with the medium,
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.780]   the nature of the platform?
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.580]   - I think Twitter will always be closer to TikTok
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.340]   than it is to YouTube, at least in its current form.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.340]   I don't see 20 minute, one hour long videos or whatever,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.020]   even 15 minute videos being watched over there.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.900]   I see it more as like the short and snappy stuff
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.580]   closer to TikTok.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.380]   - But at the same time,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.900]   Twitter is a really good comment section for the internet.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.860]   - I mean, it's almost weird why,
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.400]   like why doesn't Twitter allow you to embed YouTube videos?
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.060]   Like why does, you should just ask Elon that.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.720]   Like, I don't know if that's a YouTube thing,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.540]   but when a YouTuber posts a video,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.780]   why do they have to link to YouTube?
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.100]   Why can't they just embed it on Twitter
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.340]   and you just play it there?
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.860]   I mean, wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems?
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.180]   - Yeah, but then the two companies
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.140]   would have to agree to integrate each other's content.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.340]   - I don't know, but it seems like a win-win.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   I mean, well, it's more of a win for Twitter
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.100]   'cause then people don't have to leave the platform.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.300]   I mean, that'd be the easiest solution.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   - But who gets, like when you watch the ads
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.140]   on a YouTube video that's embedded in Twitter,
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.980]   who gets the money?
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.660]   - It would still be YouTube, but at least then,
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.420]   right now people just post a link
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.260]   and it takes you off Twitter
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.060]   and it just kills your session time on Twitter.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.100]   - That's really interesting, but yeah,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.060]   'cause the Twitter, whatever the dynamics of the comments,
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.740]   especially once the spam bots are taken care of,
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.940]   Twitter just works.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.780]   It's really nice.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.020]   So Reddit is a nice comment section for the internet.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.180]   It's like slower paced, more deliberate,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.860]   like higher effort.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.180]   Twitter's like this high paced,
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.020]   like ephemeral kind of stream,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.980]   but there's the upvoting and the downvoting
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.580]   works much better 'cause you can do retweeting, right?
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.300]   'Cause the social network is much stronger
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.460]   than it is on YouTube.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.540]   Like the interconnectivity between--
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.500]   - Yeah, on Reddit, you're gonna get,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.020]   the top replies are gonna be the most refined ones,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.620]   whereas Twitter, stuff flows to the top
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.660]   that's not super refined.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.500]   But like you're saying,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.580]   it's more off the cuff stream of consciousness,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.260]   which a lot of people prefer,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260]   'cause it's a little more personal.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.780]   - How do you think Twitter compares to YouTube
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.340]   in terms of how you see its future on role in 2023?
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.860]   - I mean, I think YouTube's gonna be YouTube
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.740]   and not much is really gonna change,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.260]   but it's gonna keep growing just because,
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.480]   that's just what it does, 'cause it's owned by Google.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.140]   But Twitter, I don't know.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.500]   I mean, it's one of those things,
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.900]   like you can't predict if a year from now,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.980]   an economy's gonna be in a recession or booming.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.980]   And I think Twitter's kind of the same thing.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.820]   One thing's for certain,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.060]   a lot of things are gonna be rolled out,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.260]   but who knows, honestly.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.900]   - You responded to Elon saying,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.980]   "Twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.000]   "more money than YouTube."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.180]   Why do you think that is?
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.380]   - Well, yeah, 'cause I think the tweet I responded to
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.440]   is one where he was saying that,
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.500]   users will jump over if Twitter can potentially pay more
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.660]   than other platforms.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.500]   And I was just saying,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.020]   obviously 'cause Google has Google AdWords,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.460]   and that's Google's whole thing,
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.580]   it's putting ads on stuff.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.120]   They've been doing it better than anyone else in the world
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.260]   for a very long time.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.980]   It's very unlikely in the next few years
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.500]   that Twitter's gonna just magically, or any platform,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.340]   give a creator the ability to make higher CPMs
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.460]   than on YouTube.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.260]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.940]   Some creators in December,
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.180]   Q4 'cause ad rates are higher
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.140]   'cause of Christmas and everything,
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.140]   some creators literally make like $30, $40 per 1,000 views.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.580]   That's after YouTube's cut.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.620]   It's almost like hard to think about
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.900]   how high the RPMs get.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.380]   And even then, once you pull out of financing cars,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.980]   the high CPM niches,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.580]   and you move into just normal stuff,
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.380]   it's still just crazy.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.660]   The sheer volume of creators,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.460]   and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar CPMs
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.420]   at scale, it's pretty beautiful.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   - So you do, I don't know what you would call them,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.780]   but like integrated ads in your videos,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.620]   and you do it, I would say masterfully.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.460]   It's like part of the video.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.380]   - Are you talking about brand deals?
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.860]   - Brand deals, is that what you would call that?
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.700]   - Yep.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.860]   - So brand deal is part of the video.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.540]   It's still really exciting to watch,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.740]   and yet there's a plug for the brand.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.220]   - In general, just brand deals,
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.700]   since you brought it up, integrating them well.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.620]   I think that's something a lot of creators don't do.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.580]   Like they'll just do a brand deal out of the blue.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.100]   They'll just be filming a video,
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.220]   and then around the three minute mark,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.060]   just start talking about a random company.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.100]   And I feel like if you don't want viewers to click away,
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.020]   and you want people to not get pissed off,
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.080]   and call you to sell out,
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.060]   you gotta find a way to integrate into the content.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.020]   And ideally, use the money in the video to make it better.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.460]   The easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.420]   is just tell people how you're using money
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.140]   from the brand deal to make your content better.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.780]   And if you do that, no one cares.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.060]   Now they're supporting you for it.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.380]   And you go from being a sellout to like,
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.580]   oh, I'm doing this to make better videos for you guys.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.460]   - I don't know if you can share,
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.700]   but with those brands, when you have discussions with them,
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.060]   are they strict about how long
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.700]   you need to be talking about it?
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.100]   Or is it more about they're leaving control to you
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.980]   about the artistic element of it?
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.260]   - The problem is the ones who don't give us
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.100]   the artistic element,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.740]   we just don't really work with anymore.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.180]   Because it's just, you know,
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.920]   we get 100 million views a video now,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.200]   and I can confidently say I know how to entertain them
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.620]   and convert them better than these random brands.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.720]   So yeah, if they don't give us that freedom,
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.900]   I just won't work with them.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.140]   - So you have that leverage, but for smaller creators--
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.260]   - It's a lot harder, yeah.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.780]   And they're gonna just say,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.380]   "45 seconds, here's what you say, take it or leave it."
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.060]   And it's like pretty brutal.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.320]   'Cause I think just in general,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.820]   if brands were more accommodating
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.500]   to let creators tell their story of the brand
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.860]   and talk about the brand in a way
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.220]   that felt a little more natural,
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.580]   I think A, it'd be less cringe,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.300]   people would be less likely to go,
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.660]   "Tap, tap, tap, skip."
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.660]   And obviously it would convert better.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.700]   But they're just so afraid
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.900]   and they want this standardized thing.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.660]   Say these words in 45 seconds,
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.300]   right here at this three minute mark.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.660]   - Yeah, I often think about how to resist that.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.340]   - You just don't do them though, right?
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.500]   - Not on YouTube, right.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.580]   On audio, I do ads in the very beginning,
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.480]   and I say, "You can skip them if you want."
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.320]   - Gotcha.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.560]   I'm sure the brand loves that.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.400]   (laughs)
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.300]   - I don't, like the point is they...
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.620]   (laughs)
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.980]   So the funny thing about podcasts
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.460]   is different than YouTube videos.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.560]   Podcast people actually do listen to ads a lot
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.420]   because it's slower paced
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.640]   and they like the creator voice,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   like talking about the thing.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.400]   But in general, I just don't believe
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.800]   you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly,
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   and that's going to be effective.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.080]   I wanna see the data for that.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.640]   I think what's much more effective is the way you do ads,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.200]   which is like integrating to the content,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.440]   like put a lot of effort into making a part of that,
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.720]   like doing the brand deals.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.440]   And I just, it's difficult to have that conversation.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.320]   It's like a very strenuous conversation
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.840]   you have to have with brands.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.320]   You have to each one at a time.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.760]   And I just wish there was more of a culture to say like,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.820]   the quality of the ad read matters a lot more
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.260]   than the like, the silly parameters,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.800]   like the timing of it, like how long it is,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.720]   the placement of it, all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.520]   - What percentage of your viewers do you think
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.220]   have seen one of my videos before?
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.000]   - What percentage of the viewers on YouTube, right?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   - Yeah, of your viewers.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.880]   - Of the viewers on YouTube though?
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.720]   - Yeah, yeah. - 'Cause most of the people--
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.440]   - Okay, sure, or all of them.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.880]   It's just interesting 'cause you're speaking
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.480]   very specifically like about my brand deal process.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.560]   And so in my head, I'm like, hmm,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.000]   I wonder what percentage of these people
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.760]   even have any idea what he's talking about.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.600]   - That's interesting.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.080]   I love the thinking about numbers.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.400]   - The whole time we were having this conversation,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.260]   it's all I could think about, it's like, God damn it.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.860]   There's probably like 50% of these people
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.220]   have no fucking clue what he's saying.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.260]   - Probably. - And we're about to torture
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.100]   him for five minutes.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.420]   - Yeah, yeah, probably.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.460]   - But that's something I can't turn off in my brain.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.620]   - Less than 50%.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.860]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.300]   Is that exciting to you?
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.020]   That there's like 50% of people don't,
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.620]   have not watched a Mr. Beast video.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.460]   Isn't that an opportunity to like--
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.940]   - Yeah, I guess it's an opportunity to grow.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.900]   I don't know, honestly, I was just kind of excited
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.740]   to hang out with you.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.580]   - Yeah, me too. - Yeah, me too.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.060]   - I mean, today was a lot of fun.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.220]   - Who cares if there's mics?
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.960]   - Yeah, so it was kind of like having a buddy
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.080]   to go along the journey as I'm just kind of eating shit
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.480]   and doing my normal grind.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   It was like kind of fun.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.600]   And also you just say really wise stuff constantly.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.240]   So honestly, no, I never even put any thought
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.680]   into like the demographics or what I could gain.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.040]   It's just interesting 'cause like my retention brain,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   when you talk about something, I'm instantly like,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   hmm, what value are they gonna get?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.720]   How many of them are gonna be interested?
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.140]   What percentage of people do I think will lose?
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.800]   And I'm like running all those calculations
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.560]   in the background and that whole conversation,
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.200]   like the lot, anyway, it's just something
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.740]   I can't turn off, my bells are like, error, error,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.060]   this is bad. (laughs)
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.940]   - What are the different strategies for high retention
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.480]   for your videos and in general?
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.020]   - It's like, how do you cook good food?
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.820]   That's like the same kind of question.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.620]   - I see, so there's so many different ways that you,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.500]   so it boils down to, I mean, do you think
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.300]   at the level of a story or do you think
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.580]   like literally watching five seconds at a time,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.580]   am I gonna tune out here, am I gonna tune out here,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.580]   am I gonna tune out here?
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.420]   - It's all of it.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.480]   You need the overarching narrative
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.060]   and then you also need the micro where every second
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.000]   needs to be entertaining.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.320]   And basically, what's interesting is the longer people
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.160]   watch something, the more likely they are to keep watching.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.920]   So you don't have to try as hard
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   in the hypothetically back half of a video
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.240]   as you do in the front.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.460]   Like even right now, we're so deep into this
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.360]   where a lot of people listening are probably
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.320]   just gonna keep listening relatively close to the end
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.080]   unless we just have a really boring part
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.440]   of this conversation 'cause they're just in it,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.680]   they're immersed.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.640]   And so, to really boil it down to a simple level,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.660]   you just wanna get people where they're immersed
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.360]   in the content and then just kinda hold them there.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.640]   - We had this discussion offline.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.320]   And by the way, I should mention that
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.520]   this is like late at night.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.760]   - It is, what time is it?
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.280]   It's nine o'clock.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.580]   - And I only slept one hour last night
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.000]   because I'm an idiot and I flew to the wrong location.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.720]   - Well, here, we're like, hey,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.480]   let's just book you a hotel and a flight.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.320]   He's like, no, I got it.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.140]   We're like, you sure?
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.640]   We can just do it, we always do this.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.920]   He's like, no, I got it, I got it.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   - He's gonna have to rub it in.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.800]   - I know, and then today, come to find out,
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.960]   he flew to the wrong airport,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.760]   airport with the, or city with a similar name to ours.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.600]   - Same name.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.920]   Same name in a different state.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.760]   (laughing)
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   - And I was like, that's why you should have let us book it.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   And so, he's on one hour of sleep
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.160]   and he's literally been dying all day.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.840]   Before this podcast, he downed like two things of coffee.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.520]   We've been going all day hard.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.560]   - Yeah, I've been, I got to interact with you.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.680]   I should say that this gave me an opportunity to,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.000]   I got a ride from a stranger
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.240]   and it was an incredible person.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.840]   I got to interact with them.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.120]   So, it's like there's so many kind people around here.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.800]   Just like this kind of Southern energy.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.080]   And then I got to go to a diner 'cause I could,
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.440]   there's only one hour between me arriving
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.560]   and having to fly out.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   So, I went to a diner.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.920]   There's a really kind waitress that called me honey.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.720]   So, that was a beautiful moment.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.600]   - I was so confused.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.640]   You tweeted about that and like,
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.480]   Steel's like, my assistant was like, Lex isn't here yet.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.920]   And I saw your tweet and I was like,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.760]   he's here.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.240]   Steel's like, no, he's still flying.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.080]   I was like, an hour ago,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.880]   he just tweeted about a nice diner.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.720]   - Yeah.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.560]   - I didn't realize you flew to the wrong--
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.240]   - It was a diner in a different state.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.080]   - And then you had to fly over here.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.440]   And then I called you, you didn't answer.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.280]   I was like, hmm.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.040]   I was like, something's not adding up.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.320]   - Yeah, I feel like such an idiot
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   'cause apparently the world has cities like Springfield.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.440]   Right?
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.000]   Like every single state has a Springfield.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   - Oh, really?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.840]   - I think so.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.880]   - Okay, whatever.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.280]   - That's like a Simpsons joke, right?
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.800]   That like, it's the city in the Simpsons is Springfield.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.680]   And I think every single state
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.120]   or most of them have a Springfield.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.960]   And the same is true for like Georgetown.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.800]   I think the most popular,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.600]   I forget what the most popular one was.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.720]   But there's like a list of things people get.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.760]   When they run out of ideas,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.600]   they just keep using the same thing over and over.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.120]   - They're your Achilles heel.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.160]   (laughs)
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.440]   - Yeah, I got to meet a bunch of people from your team.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.120]   They're just incredible human beings.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.320]   So let me just ask on that topic.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.880]   How do you hire a great team?
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   Like what have you learned about hiring for everything?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.480]   For the main channel that you do,
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.000]   for the React, the gaming channel,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.720]   to MrBeastBurger, to Feastables, all that?
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.400]   - The big thing is, especially in this content creation,
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.680]   'cause it's not like anything that's done on Netflix
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.320]   or different content medians.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   I really need people who are coachable
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.040]   and really see the value in what I care about.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.320]   Because it's a very specific way of going about things.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.360]   And it's a thing, there's no one, like plug and play.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.600]   Like if Netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.160]   there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.600]   that have worked on documentaries before.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.560]   But if you want to hire someone
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.720]   to make super viral YouTube videos, like we do,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.600]   there's just no one you can really pull from.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.120]   Like sometimes I'll hire people from game shows, right?
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.320]   They have all these preconceived notions about pacing
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.600]   and how a video should be.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.160]   And you have to spend the first year
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.280]   breaking all these habits,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.360]   and they think they're better than you.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.160]   Like a lot of people in traditional think they're better,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.120]   and they think their way is better than what we do.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.280]   And so for me, it's almost easier to hire people
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.200]   that are just hard workers, that are obsessed,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.280]   and really coachable, and just train 'em
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.200]   how to be good at content creation and production,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.440]   than to hire someone from traditional,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.480]   which is the only way to really do it,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.800]   'cause there's not that many YouTube channels
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.640]   that have scaled up.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.160]   So it's not like there's a huge talent pool
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.240]   of people who've worked on YouTube channels.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.440]   So it's easier just to train someone
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.040]   than just pull 'em from traditional,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.840]   'cause traditional people just, I don't know,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.360]   they have all these opinions and things,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.680]   and they just think our way of going about things is dumb.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.160]   - Yeah, so you want people who have the humility
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.080]   to have a beginner's mind, even if they have experience.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.920]   - And see the value.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.960]   Like actually, you'll still get it.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   It's so crazy.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.400]   Especially some of my other friends
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.760]   that are scaling up their YouTube channels.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.400]   There's people that'll come on, and you'll ask them,
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.640]   like, "What do you wanna be doing in five years?"
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   And instead of saying,
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   "Oh, I wanna be working on this channel,"
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.680]   they'll be like, "Oh, I hope to be working on movies,"
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.520]   or this or that.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.080]   And they see working on a YouTube channel
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.880]   as a launchpad to go into traditional.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   And it's like, no, you just don't get it.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.160]   - This is the future.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   - This is the end goal.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.400]   This is your career.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.760]   And so I'm just so tired
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.480]   of having those kinds of conversations.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.120]   I feel like people really should be coming around.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.920]   - Are there recurring interview questions that you ask?
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.520]   Is there ways to get--
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.160]   - Yeah, but the biggest thing is,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.360]   what do you wanna be doing in 10 years?
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.080]   And if their answer isn't making content on YouTube,
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.560]   or if their answer is anything like movies
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.040]   or traditional stuff like that,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.600]   it's just a hell no.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.800]   It just won't even remotely work.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.840]   - Oh, so you really want people
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.360]   to believe in the vision of YouTube?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.840]   - Yeah, I mean, ideally, it's like,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   oh, working here, you know what I mean?
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.240]   - So it's less about the medium
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.760]   and more about just being on a great team
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.680]   that's doing epic stuff.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.320]   - Yeah, well, and yeah, the media as well.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.200]   'Cause those, it's just, it's hard to put into words,
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.000]   but it's just two completely different ways
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.680]   of going about things.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.000]   Our videos aren't scripted,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.320]   and it's a lot more run and gun.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   And if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever,
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   you only have one take, you know what I mean?
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.320]   And it's not scripted, and so you have to over-film,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.280]   over-shoot things, over-compensate
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.880]   for the dumb way of going about it.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.320]   And a lot of traditional people would be like,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.480]   well, just plan what you're gonna say
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.320]   and just plan the angles.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.560]   You can cut the cameras in half,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   you can save 50 grand here,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.560]   you can save $75,000 in editing, this and that.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.880]   And it's like, yeah, but that's not authentic.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.360]   That's, you know, blah, blah.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.280]   You get it.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.600]   It's almost so obvious that it hurts
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.520]   that I have to constantly have these conversations,
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   but it's the world we live in.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.160]   - But there's also a detail, like there's a taste.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.280]   Like I've watched a bunch of videos with you,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.960]   I don't know what the right word is,
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.480]   style or taste, to be able to know what's good and not
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.360]   in terms of retention, in terms of,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.020]   just stylistically, visually.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.860]   - I don't have to think.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.800]   I can just watch a video, and it just screams in my head,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.160]   like this is what should change,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.920]   based on the million videos I've watched
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.440]   and all these viral videos I've consumed.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.360]   Like this is blah, blah, blah, what's optimal,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.320]   and things like that.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.440]   It's almost like your brain's like a neural net.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.260]   And like if you consume enough viral videos
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.560]   and enough good content that you just kind of start
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.360]   to train your brain to see it and see these patterns
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.720]   that happen in all these viral videos.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.800]   And so that, anytime I watch a video,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.760]   or a movie or anything,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.160]   I just can't stop thinking about what is optimal.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   And so it's like, it gives me a headache sometimes
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.400]   when I watch something too slow
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.560]   where I don't think it's optimal.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   Obviously my taste isn't the end all be all.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.320]   But that's something that kind of torments me,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.040]   if that makes any sense.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.800]   - Oh, you can't enjoy a slow-moving movie.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.760]   - No, I can't.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.040]   And that's not to say there's--
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.960]   - Your attention on "The Godfather" is horrible.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.880]   - Yeah, no, exactly.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.320]   I've tried to watch that movie like three times.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.440]   But that's not to say slow movies are bad.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.640]   Like there's an audience for it.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   It's just obviously not what I've trained my brain to like.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.800]   And social media and YouTube right now,
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.840]   that's just not the meta.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.720]   - And in general, like you said, in neural network,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.480]   you're training your brain in part on actual data.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.120]   Right, so you're actually data-driven.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.320]   So you're looking at like,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.120]   in terms of thumbnails and titles,
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.400]   and different aspects of the first five, 10 seconds,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.200]   and then throughout the video, the retention, all that.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.400]   You're looking at all of that for your own videos
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.880]   to understand how to do it better.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.640]   So that's where the neural network is training.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.880]   Basically, there are ways you can kind of see
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.560]   like the most viewed videos on YouTube every day
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   and stuff like that.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   And I just kind of consume those every single day.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.520]   I've been doing that for way too many years.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.120]   And you just start to notice patterns.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.560]   Like the thumbnails on the most viewed videos
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.200]   or videos that go super viral tend to be clear,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.480]   tend to not have much clutter, tend to be pretty simple.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.240]   Titles tend to be less than 50 characters.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.520]   Intros tend to be this.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.720]   Stories tend to be this.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.760]   And you just kind of like,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.080]   after you see those thousands
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.640]   and then tens of thousands of time,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.680]   it just starts to click in your head.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.960]   Like this is what it looks like, you know?
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.320]   - So how are you able to transfer that taste
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.160]   that you've developed to the team?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.240]   So for like, 'cause you said like broad things,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.480]   but I'm sure there's a million detailed things.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.120]   Like what zoom to use on the face
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.560]   to use in the thumbnail, right?
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.600]   - The answer is whatever makes the best video.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   'Cause the problem is the more,
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.200]   I have so many friends who are like this.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.800]   They'll make like checklists for their editors.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.080]   They'll be like, you know, this beat and this beat.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   And you need to have like a three part arc and then this.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.560]   But the problem is that's how you,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.360]   the more constraints you put on the team,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.600]   the more repetitive and less innovation you get.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.000]   And the more like, you know, after 10 videos,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.360]   people are gonna be like, all right, I've already seen this.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   So to me, and I'm 24 and you know,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.600]   I'm probably my mindset will change over the next 10 years.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.400]   I just haven't been in this industry too long.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.440]   But the only way to like really make innovative content
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.840]   and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.560]   or put as little as possible.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.200]   And so that's why I'm very hesitant on all that stuff
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.640]   because the more I say, the more they're gonna be like,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.600]   oh, then that's what we do.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.360]   And then, you know, I'll say one time like,
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.280]   oh, you know, ideally there's a cut every three seconds.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.120]   And the next thing you know, every video,
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.840]   there's a cut every three seconds or whatever.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   So it's hard because I try to give as little,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.360]   not training, but as little facts as possible
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   and more just make suggestions, if that makes any sense.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.840]   - You mean publicly or to your team?
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.800]   - To my team, yeah.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.760]   - So you talked about sort of teaching your voice
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.800]   or your style, whatever we wanna call it,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.400]   to other people on the team so they can be
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.840]   kind of a Mr. Beast replacement.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.920]   So what's the process of teaching this?
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.760]   So you don't wanna--
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.600]   - No, I got you.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.040]   So you're more talking about like what I would call
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.320]   almost like cloning, right?
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.840]   Like Tyler and other people like that.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.160]   Yeah, so when we were hanging out today,
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.880]   I was showing him how we have multiple people in the company.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   It's almost like talking to the camera.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.400]   - Yeah, you turn slowly to the camera.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.320]   - I was like, anyways, have it.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   - Is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.920]   - This whole interview, I constantly have been turning
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.680]   towards the camera when I'm talking to him.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.120]   It's a habit.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.440]   'Cause my whole life, I've just been talking to a camera.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.360]   - Who are you thinking about
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.520]   when you're looking at the camera?
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.000]   Do you like imagine somebody?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.200]   - I'm fully thinking about the person
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.520]   just sitting watching it.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.200]   And I almost, it's weird, when I'm looking at the camera,
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.320]   I don't see a camera.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.600]   I'm like in a haze picturing what the viewer is seeing
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.320]   when they watch it, if that makes sense.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.800]   And that's where I'll be saying things or doing something.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.160]   And then like when I'm watching,
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.600]   I'm like, that's not what I want.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.920]   And then I'll freeze up.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.040]   It's very weird when I'm filming.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.680]   And for people who haven't worked with me too much,
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.120]   they'll think like, I don't know, it's very weird.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.440]   Like how I go about it.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.600]   'Cause I'll just be doing whatever,
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.000]   like lighting a firework.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.520]   This is a thousand dollar firework.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.560]   And I'll go to light it and I'll like freeze.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.080]   'Cause in my head I'm like, this, I don't know.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.720]   I don't like how that flowed or how that shot looked.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.960]   'Cause it's weird.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.480]   I can perfectly picture what I'm filming
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.520]   by just looking at the camera
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.680]   and then putting myself through the lens of the camera
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.840]   while making content.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.360]   I can do it at the same time.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.440]   - So you're like real time editing.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   That's something that didn't at the start come natural to me,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.440]   but in the last probably like five years it's happened.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.280]   And so I would say it's one of my greatest strengths,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.800]   but I don't know how I developed it.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.200]   But anytime I'm filming anything,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.000]   like it's almost like the right side of my brain.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.440]   I can just look at it and I see exactly what I'm filming
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   and I can just picture it.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.320]   - Well, that's probably recording the video,
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.280]   being the talent for the video,
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.880]   and then watching the editing
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.080]   and like analyzing it carefully
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.920]   and do that over and over and over and over.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.120]   - Yeah, you do that 10,000 times.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.240]   - You do the editing more
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.440]   than being in front of the camera.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.760]   So like you start to see yourself
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.320]   from that third person perspective.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.160]   - Exactly.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.000]   - And then maybe that actually helps
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.240]   with the nerves of it too.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.760]   Like you see it as creating a video versus performing.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.120]   - Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.560]   It's weird, I've never been nervous talking to a camera.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.480]   It's harder for me to talk to a person
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.880]   than it is to talk to a camera,
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.840]   which I feel like a lot of people say that though,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.080]   that are whatever, make content, right?
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.920]   - Interesting.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.800]   - I've heard that so many times.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.360]   Or maybe not, maybe I'm just awkward and dumb.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.520]   - Maybe they're practiced.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.680]   To me, both are terrifying,
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.360]   but being in front of the camera by yourself is most--
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.320]   - So much easier.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.160]   - Really?
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:58.980]   - Yeah, so much easier.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.200]   I've referred a million times over.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   (exhaling)
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.240]   But that's my whole life, you know?
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.040]   So it's just, that's why it's interesting.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.000]   Like you've spent more of your time talking to people.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.680]   It comes natural and I talk to a piece of plastic.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.160]   - Oh yeah, I guess you're talking to a person too.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.000]   There's just on the other side of the camera.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.240]   - Yeah, there's just a pixel on a screen.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.400]   - So cloning, how do you achieve the--
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.240]   - Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.060]   This whole rabbit trail.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.360]   So I was showing him that I have a lot of people
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.200]   in the company who are able to think like me
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   and basically make decisions like I would make if I was,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.520]   if you were asked, "Hey, in this video,
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.080]   "should we climb a mountain or should we dig a hole?"
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.520]   Right, and they would pick the same answer
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.140]   I'd pick 90 plus percent of the times.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.000]   And so one example is Tyler, who I was showing you,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.800]   and he was pitching some content.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.540]   And you could see, he was on point.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.760]   And basically for just four or five years,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.120]   we just spent an absurd amount of time together
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.600]   and worked on every single video together
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.520]   and we worked side by side.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.120]   And same thing with my CEO, James.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.140]   He literally lived with me for a couple of years.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.480]   I'm a big fan of just like finding people
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.640]   who are super obsessed and all in and A players
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.760]   that they really just wanna be great.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.800]   And then just dumping everything I have in them.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.960]   - And then you were saying,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.040]   'cause I'd love to find that and develop that,
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.780]   you're saying you're basically for a long time
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.500]   just said everything you were thinking to them.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.340]   - Exactly.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.940]   Like James, the guy who's basically my right hand man
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.220]   right now, for two years, he lived with me.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.740]   And we probably talked on average
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.340]   over those two years, seven hours a day.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.540]   I mean, anytime I had a phone call, I'd throw it on speaker
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.840]   and I'd let him listen.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.940]   Anything I was reading, any content I was consuming,
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.780]   like really just training his brain to think like me.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.300]   So that way he could just do things without my input,
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.020]   without me having to constantly watch over him
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.900]   or give him advice.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.720]   And that's where we've gotten.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.080]   So for the first six months, he didn't do anything.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.560]   He just studied me and studied everything I cared about
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.200]   and how I spoke and blah, blah.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.360]   And then the next six months,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.120]   he started taking on some responsibilities
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.160]   and now he can just run the company
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.360]   and I don't ever really have to check in on him.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.120]   Most of the decisions he makes are exactly what I would do.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.940]   And so I call that cloning.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.960]   I don't know what other people would,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.380]   but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.560]   and they just kind of really want it
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   and just being like giving them an avenue to get it,
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.880]   if that makes any sense.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.740]   - Another way to see it is you're converging
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.060]   towards a common vision
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.800]   and that makes like brainstorming much more productive.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.840]   - Yeah, it just makes it where I don't have to be
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.240]   so involved in everything
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.800]   because I just have these people I know
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.560]   will think like I will, at least relatively close to it.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.040]   So I can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.180]   And so these things that, you know,
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.000]   I still approve every idea we film
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.680]   and everything before we film it, all the creative,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.520]   I approve it,
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   but I don't have to like be in the weeds and nuances
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.020]   and do all this minor stuff.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.920]   I can just let them handle it.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.520]   I can just do the more macro things.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.440]   - I got a chance to sit in
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.280]   to a lengthy brainstorming session with Tyler and others.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.040]   That was really cool.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.440]   Can you talk about the process of that,
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.920]   of people pitching ideas
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.160]   and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.440]   and just going, like plowing through ideas very quickly?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.920]   - I mean, you kind of just described exactly what we did.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.720]   - Yeah, I mean, but the ideas are really, really good.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.600]   It's just tossing out like different categories of ideas
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.160]   and then also fine tuning them to see like,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.920]   how do I change, like thinking about the titles
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.740]   and the thumbnails.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.360]   - I work so well off of inspiration.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.580]   It's like, it's something,
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.000]   like give me any word, I don't know.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.840]   Make it relative. - Space.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.000]   - Space, yeah, like I went to space, you know.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.640]   What happens if you blow up a nuke in space
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.420]   or I went to the moon, I went to Mars.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.600]   Right, because you said that one word,
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.160]   it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.800]   And so that's just, it's for me,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.120]   the way to get a hundred million views on videos,
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.680]   you need something original, creative,
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.360]   something people really need to see,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.920]   ideally never been done before, all these like things.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.200]   And so you need like,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.560]   if you want to consistently go super well,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.480]   you need just a constant stream of ideas.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.440]   And the only way I've really found
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.520]   that I can consistently come up with a hundred million
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.900]   view videos is to intake inspiration
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.600]   and then see what my brain outputs.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.680]   And so that's kind of at its core foundation,
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.520]   what I'm doing there.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.980]   It's just like intaking a lot of random inspiration
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.040]   to see what spawns in my mind so I can output it.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.540]   - But the neural network of your brain is generating
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:23.160]   the video, the title, the thumbnail, all like jointly.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.040]   - Exactly, and that only comes because
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.360]   I spent 10 years of my life just obsessively
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.280]   studying all that stuff.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.900]   - 'Cause you, I mean, it seems like you would literally
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.160]   potentially shut down a video
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.000]   just 'cause you can't come up with a good title.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.360]   - Yeah, 100%, or a thumbnail.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.520]   Yeah, I mean, that's what happened to 70% of those
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.360]   in that pitch session.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.960]   I was just like, oh, what was one of them?
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.880]   Genius versus 100 people, or?
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.200]   - Yeah, like maybe Average Intelligence versus Genius,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   something like that.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.880]   - Yeah, I was like, what the heck is the thumbnail?
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.920]   Even if the title is good.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.360]   I mean, there's so many, but yeah,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.680]   people don't click, they don't watch.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.640]   - That's so interesting, but you developed over time
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.040]   the ability to kind of give it, what?
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.200]   What makes for a good title, short?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.160]   - Not just short, it's also, I mean,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   if someone reads it, are they, like,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.960]   do they have to watch it?
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   Is it just so intrinsically interesting
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.760]   that it's just gonna fuck with them
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.520]   if they don't click on it, you know what I mean?
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.880]   - So it doesn't have to be short, but it has to be,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.000]   like, you almost want to have a retention
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.520]   to word-by-word reading.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.900]   - Ideally, it's a title also that,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.860]   'cause the titles don't live in a vacuum, right?
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.600]   So it has to lead into the content.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.220]   So ideally, the title represents content
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.800]   that you would wanna watch for 20 minutes.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.200]   So if it's a 20-minute video
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.320]   and the title is "I Stepped on a Bug,"
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.880]   it's not gonna, 'cause it's all of it combined,
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.560]   the click-through rate's gonna be much lower
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.080]   than if it was, like, a five-second video.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   People might click it.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.800]   So you gotta, like, even nuances
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   of the length of the video based against the title
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.400]   will affect whether people wanna click it,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.080]   'cause sometimes they just all add up.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.360]   I mean, it's that, yes,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.040]   ideally you want it below 50 characters,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   because above 50 characters on certain devices,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.080]   you run the chance of it going dot, dot, dot.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.280]   So, like, I took a light pole
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.560]   and I saw how many dollar bills I could stack on top,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.720]   and they would just go dot, dot, dot,
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.400]   'cause it's too long and they can't finish it.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   And that's the worst thing,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.240]   because then people don't even know
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.060]   what they're clicking on,
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.280]   and so it's gonna do even worse.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.180]   Short, simple, ideally,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.400]   and just so freaking interesting they have to click,
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.560]   and it is a good segue into the content,
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.240]   and it represents the length of the content.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.160]   - And there's probably stuff
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.560]   it's hard to convert into words for you,
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.120]   like "I Stepped on a Bug" versus "Stepping on a Bug"
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.840]   versus "Mr. B Stepped on a Bug" versus "Bug Stepping Video."
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.640]   - So it's like, yes, the more extreme the opinion,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.880]   typically the higher the click-through rate.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.800]   If you can pay it off in the content,
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.320]   then it just supercharges it.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.160]   - Oh, so you have a kind of estimate
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.000]   of the extremeness of the content.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.480]   - Yeah, like this water, right?
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.840]   If you're like, Fiji water sucks, that'd do fine.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.000]   But if you said Fiji water is the worst water bottle,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.440]   or the worst water I've ever drank in my life,
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.160]   way more extreme opinion would do way better.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.300]   - But you have to deliver.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.600]   - Yeah, but then you have to deliver,
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.640]   'cause the more extreme you are,
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.760]   the more extreme you have to be in the video.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.520]   - That's almost inspiration for you to step up.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.480]   - Yeah, but you can be more extreme in a positive way.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.320]   A lot of people, it's easier though.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.500]   Negative click-bait's much easier than positive click-bait.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.520]   It just is, it's so much easier to get negative clicks.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.200]   And so a lot of people are just, in my opinion,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.360]   you know, a little bit lazier,
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.880]   and they just take the route like,
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   oh, well, this one gets the same amount of clicks,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.480]   and it's easier, less effort.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.320]   - The positive one is doing a large number
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.880]   of numbers of something.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.120]   Like I spent this number of hours doing this.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.280]   - Or whatever, if you just wanted to help people.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.880]   It's just harder to get 10 million views
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.240]   on a video helping people than it is
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.400]   to get 10 million views on a video
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.840]   tearing down a celebrity, you know what I mean?
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.520]   Or whatever negative video you wanna insert there.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.240]   - Well, that said, most of your videos are pretty positive.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.840]   - Yes, but not a lot of people do those kinds of videos,
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.680]   'cause they're hard.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.000]   - Yeah, they're hard.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.200]   Some of that is giving away money, right?
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.240]   What's the secret to that?
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.120]   How do you do that right?
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.240]   - Yeah, give away money?
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.480]   - In a video to make it compelling.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.200]   So there's a number that is better
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.360]   than another number, right?
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.520]   - The higher number is always better than the lower number.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.640]   Yeah, for the most part.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.840]   And you know, it's interesting,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   like some videos will give away a million dollars,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.600]   some videos will give away half a million.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.200]   There's not really, I guess,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.440]   so I'm retracting what I just said.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.560]   I was more joking with that,
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.480]   but there's no difference whether I put 500K or a million.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.640]   There's probably not even really a difference
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.520]   between 100K or a million.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.760]   I haven't really looked into it.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.480]   Like some of our, most of our videos
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.080]   are not us giving away a million dollars,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.360]   and sometimes the million dollar videos
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.520]   just don't do as well as the other ones.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.760]   So there is a certain point where a dollar amount
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.280]   is just a large dollar amount to an average human.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.800]   And so I think that point is 100K.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   Like anything above 100K,
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.280]   the average human is just like, that's a lot of money.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.520]   It doesn't, 100K and a million,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   like it doesn't really move the needle,
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.920]   if that makes sense.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.400]   Which that's a very nuanced piece of information
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.760]   that applies to very few people, but yeah.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.720]   - Well, no, I think it applies, it's fascinating.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.680]   It's fascinating, human,
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.760]   our relationship with money is fascinating.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.400]   Like why is it so exciting to get,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.080]   I mean, I, you know, the times I've found
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.760]   like 20 bucks in the ground are like incredible.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.080]   - Really? - I don't know why, right?
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.280]   Why, why are you so happy?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.520]   Like what exactly is so joyful about that?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.240]   I mean, it depends where you are in life,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.760]   what the situation is.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.600]   There's also a gamified aspect to it.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   It's exciting.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.760]   - Yeah, no, I get it.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.720]   Like why people want to see people win money.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.960]   It's just interesting that past 100 grand,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.520]   it doesn't really seem to make a difference.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.840]   Like it's the same basically.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.800]   - So you found that to be true
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.120]   with all the money you've given away?
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.320]   - I just think click-through rate.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.600]   Like obviously in terms of someone receiving it,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.720]   yeah, a million dollars changes their life drastically more.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.560]   Like that's the difference.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.920]   Like, oh, if you wanted to, you could really quit your job.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.360]   As opposed to 100K is like, not really.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.760]   - You probably do like a scientific study,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.580]   like a formula, giving away money to click-through rate.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.420]   - Yeah.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.240]   - There could be some kind of
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.080]   diminishing return. - I got it.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:57.200]   - So the returns level off dramatically after 100K.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.040]   That's basically the premise.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.200]   - What about 10,000?
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.320]   - No, there's 10, 100,000.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.160]   - Is that the big one?
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.880]   - It's funny 'cause this is such a small niche thing.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.080]   But yeah, 100,000 does,
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.160]   from what I see in our videos,
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.120]   get more clicks than 10,000.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.520]   But the difference between 100,000 and a million
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.560]   is just so little.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.480]   I just, I think big number, big number to a lot of people
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.760]   past that point.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.800]   - Yeah, so for 100,000, you can,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.040]   like given average salary,
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.680]   you can probably live for a year,
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.880]   given what the average salary is in America.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.640]   So that's like a big, that feels something.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   - Yeah, I think it's also just more
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.600]   when they read the title.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.880]   It's just like, it's a lot of zeros.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.600]   It's a lot of, fuck loads of zeros.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.440]   Okay, click.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.800]   (laughing)
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.700]   Oh man, that's fascinating.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.320]   So on the thumbnail side, again,
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.020]   that's gonna be much harder to say probably.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:45.360]   But offline, I got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.760]   and it's fascinating which ones do well
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.160]   and which ones don't.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.880]   Is there something you could say about
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.160]   what are the elements of a thumbnail that work well?
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.640]   Or is this also deeply instinctual?
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.400]   - Well, that's where, yeah, it's the same thing.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.600]   Like how do you cook good food?
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.400]   But it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.680]   and I can be like, that's why that's good.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.560]   That's why that's bad.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.720]   That's a, like an example would be like one of my friends,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.120]   he just uploaded a video recently and I called him.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.200]   I was like, what is this?
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.920]   Because he's a very, very smart guy.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.880]   And in the thumbnail, he's getting chased by cops,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.280]   but the cops were wearing yellow vests.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.200]   So they didn't look at cops.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.000]   So I was like, well, why are the cops in your thumbnail
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.840]   wearing yellow vests?
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.320]   That makes it so much more boring.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.480]   And he was like carrying a flag,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.600]   but the pole and the color of the flag were the same color.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.760]   So I was like, it's a lot harder to see the flag.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.200]   I was like, also you're wearing like a shirt
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.600]   with like five different colors.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.960]   So it's like, it's hard to tell what even
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.240]   what your outline is.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.800]   And then in the background, there were cars.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.280]   And I was like, well, if you have cops chasing you,
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.560]   why not make the cars cop cars?
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.280]   And it's like, 'cause in my head, I'm like, dang,
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.200]   if he just did those like four or five things,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.280]   the video probably would have got like seven X the views.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.760]   - How much iteration, 'cause I also got a chance
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.200]   to see the number of iterations you do on a,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.560]   I don't know, just a brand of thumbnails.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.200]   - It's a problem now.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.720]   It's an addiction.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.560]   - Is it?
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.040]   So you kind of, 'cause a lot of the versions
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.080]   are really good.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:03.920]   - Yeah.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.760]   - How do you know what to like stop?
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.240]   - I love how you, when we pulled up that,
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.400]   the burger one and we were flipping through them,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.240]   you're like, that's really good.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.920]   I was like, oh, that's version like one of like a thousand.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.680]   - But even the sketch, the idea was good.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   Like already even the original idea is strong.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.240]   - Yeah, so one of our coming up videos,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.960]   we made the world's largest plant-based burger
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.560]   and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   standing beside the burger 'cause it's six feet tall.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.960]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.120]   So like just picture a giant six foot tall burger,
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.980]   super wide, thousands of pounds, and then I'm beside it.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.720]   And then it's like eating the world's largest burger.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.680]   That's just something you have to click.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.240]   So you were saying like, how would you describe
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.080]   a good thumbnail?
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.680]   Like that, you know what I mean?
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.000]   - But I think you said the one I noticed first
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.760]   that was good where you were very small in it
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.640]   relative to the, and you didn't like that one, I think.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.000]   - I needed to come forward a little bit
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   and also the photo we took was just my upper body.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   So they photo manipulated and created my legs in Photoshop.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.400]   And that's why I said I didn't like it
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   'cause my right leg was a little like off.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.960]   It was like bent the wrong way
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.400]   'cause they had to build those legs in Photoshop.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.240]   - Well, I mean, does the physics in the thumbnail
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.360]   have to even make sense?
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.560]   I mean, you can just like exaggerate the head size
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.400]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.240]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.760]   Yeah, things don't have to be relative.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.360]   You can have a car in the background
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.920]   and be three times the size.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.460]   'Cause yeah, every one of my thumbnails,
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.960]   my face is in the left side, very big.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.400]   So brand recognition, so just people know.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.040]   Oh, especially 'cause now that a lot of people
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.360]   copy our videos, it's just nice to like,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.600]   you know, everyone else might make thumbnails like this,
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.760]   but this is mine.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.000]   And obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.360]   - Would you recommend to other creators
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.840]   that wanna make it big and they see Mr. Beast
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.720]   and they look up to you to copy some elements of you
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.640]   or to really try to be unique?
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   - Unique, 100% unique.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.820]   The next Mr. Beast, quote unquote,
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.860]   it feels weird saying that in third person, but whatever,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.380]   is not gonna do what I'm doing better.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.900]   They're gonna just invent their own lane.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.660]   Like you're just not gonna do what I do better than me.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.100]   You know, I have so many,
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.940]   I literally have the best people in the world working here
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.260]   and I reinvest everything I make even to this day.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.300]   Like it's absurd the amount of money I spend on content.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.940]   And I don't care, I'll just stop sleeping
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.380]   and I'll just film every other day.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.980]   Like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.180]   and that's fine, you shouldn't.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.020]   Like I didn't get where I am
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.360]   by just beating someone else at their own game.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.800]   I just found my own lane and innovated and adapted.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.520]   And so, yeah, there's a lot of people that do copy me
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.420]   and it's fine, whatever, do it,
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.700]   but just know you're not gonna get to where I am doing that.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.840]   And so I'd advise you don't.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.560]   - You give away a lot of the secrets,
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.680]   basically everything about how you operate.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.520]   Is there a--
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.600]   - I don't hold anything back, go for it.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.440]   - How do you think about that?
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.800]   'Cause that's pretty rare.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.000]   - I think, and this is definitely not,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.640]   most people in my stance,
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.160]   I don't think would take this,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.740]   or my position would take this stance,
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.560]   but I see every other YouTuber or person on social media,
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.800]   even, 'cause we're also focused super heavily on YouTube,
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.240]   but last year we were also the most followed
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.640]   TikTok creator in the world as well.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   Actually, we were most subscribed
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.480]   to YouTube channel in the world
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.680]   and the most followed TikTok account in the world.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.080]   But in general, I just see everyone else
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.200]   as collaborators, not competitors.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.960]   I don't think giving advice
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.440]   and helping other creators do well in any way harms me
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.640]   and I think it only brings more value to my life.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.120]   - How was it jumping on TikTok
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.880]   and trying to understand that platform from scratch?
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.560]   So from being a successful YouTuber
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.280]   to understand a totally different algorithm,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.040]   fundamentally different algorithm, what was that like?
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:19.880]   - It's interesting.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.720]   Well, not even just the algorithm, just the content.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.800]   I'm going from basically 15 minute short films
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.840]   to sub one minute vertical content.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.240]   It's a whole different just ballpark.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.040]   And so the first little while I was doing TikTok
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.640]   is just kind of figuring out
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.040]   what does MrBeast look like in this short form content?
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.480]   But recently we've really started to catch our stride
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.200]   and come up with some original concepts
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.000]   and figure out how to innovate over there
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:45.840]   just like we did on YouTube
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.760]   because I didn't want it to just be shitty YouTube videos.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.920]   And so like an example is we played the rock for 100K
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.080]   and rock, paper, scissors
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.400]   and the loser had to donate 100K to charity.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.800]   We went to random people on a campus and we offered them.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.600]   So I said, I'll give you $100
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.320]   if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.680]   And then they said, no, and I was like,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.080]   I will give you $300
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.920]   if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   And I was expecting this person to say no
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.080]   and it'd go up to like 10 grand.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.200]   And he's like, yes.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   And so he flew to Paris, got a baguette
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.520]   and brought it back and gave it to me.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.800]   And that across everything got like 450 million views.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.520]   'Cause it's just really cool just to see this random guy
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.360]   get on a plane, spend a day in Paris
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.600]   and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.400]   And so we're starting to find just tons
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.200]   of original content over there.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.600]   - But it seems like an epic video to make for one minute.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.400]   - Exactly, no one on short form is doing it.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.240]   That's the thing.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.080]   It's like, it's just so funny.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.360]   'Cause like TikTok's been big for a while now, years.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.920]   And then, you know, as we started to really figure
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.960]   out things on the YouTube channel and get it cranking
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.040]   where I have some free time, we set our sights on TikTok
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.920]   and like, okay, what are people not doing?
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.160]   How do we make it better?
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.880]   Put in more effort, make it good.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.600]   And we did the same thing we did at YouTube,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.560]   just different over on TikTok and it worked.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.280]   And now we're the fastest growing
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.040]   or most followed TikTok account in 2022.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.480]   And it's just funny that no one else did that.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.320]   - And you're not afraid to do epic stuff,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.840]   which also during the brainstorming,
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.680]   some of the ideas you were like, that's better as a short.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.840]   That's crazy.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.000]   - Yeah, can you remember one?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.120]   'Cause I remember I said that a bunch
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:17.960]   and I can't think of one.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.840]   - All I remember is that there were like epic videos.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.320]   Like really, you're going to do that for a one minute video?
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.160]   - Yeah. - That's crazy.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.200]   So like, are you posting similar content
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.800]   to a YouTube short as a TikTok?
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.200]   - Yeah, those we just double up.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.080]   It's just hard.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.840]   You know, what's actually pretty fascinating
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.800]   and people who do social media listening to this
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.880]   will probably find this pretty interesting
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.600]   is picture like the content creation meta three years ago
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.280]   versus now where you can make sub one minute
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.960]   vertical content and it go viral on TikTok,
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.280]   it go viral on YouTube shorts,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.680]   it go viral on Instagram Reels,
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.280]   it goes viral on Facebook, it goes Reddit.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.400]   You know, you swipe through vertical content now
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.680]   and Twitter when you click on a video
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.520]   and you flip through it.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.480]   So this is actually very weird.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.200]   This is the first time in the history of,
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.040]   I guess, Western social media that one form of content
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.600]   could actually go super viral on every single platform.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.160]   It's never been like that before.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.840]   - So they're going viral individually.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.920]   They're not like interbreeding or whatever.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.080]   - I can post something on TikTok
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.000]   that'll get a hundred million views
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.840]   and then post it on shorts and it'll get 200 million views
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.240]   and then post it on Instagram and it'll get 50 million views.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.840]   And then, you know, I haven't yet,
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.480]   but you know, you can then turn around and tweet it
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.800]   and it get tens of millions of views
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.640]   and you can post it on Reddit
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.560]   and it get tens of millions of views
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.960]   and Facebook can get tens of millions of views.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.720]   And that just wasn't a thing.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.840]   Three years ago, Twitter didn't have,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.000]   'cause a lot of you probably don't even know this,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.680]   but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.880]   it just turns into TikTok.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.960]   That wasn't a thing even a year ago.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.720]   Reddit, that wasn't a thing a year ago.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.560]   Probably two years ago, that wasn't a thing on Instagram.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   Three years ago, that wasn't a thing on YouTube,
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.720]   right, with YouTube shorts.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.960]   So this is all new.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.560]   And I don't, it's weird.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.640]   I haven't heard a single person talk about it,
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.680]   but this is the first time where content can actually
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.400]   go viral on every single platform.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.640]   And you don't have to write or film a video for Facebook,
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.480]   film a 12 minute video for YouTube,
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.760]   film a sub 60 second video for TikTok,
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.160]   write a tweet for Twitter and post this on Reddit.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.480]   You can just do the same thing on every platform.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.480]   - And the fact that your content has gone viral
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.560]   on multiple platforms regularly means
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.840]   that virality is not accidental.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.440]   Sometimes it can be, of course, but it can be engineered.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.200]   - It's yeah, so many people say it's luck
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.960]   and they're like, you're just lucky or this or that,
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.840]   but what are we up to?
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.900]   Probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.080]   Like we don't ever have a dud.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.600]   Like you can call it luck, but I think it can be trained.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.680]   I counsel YouTubers all the time
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.720]   and show them how to go from getting
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.640]   a couple million views a month
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   to 10 million views a month very easily.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.400]   And from even certain ones, like just one of my friends,
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.480]   like he was just really struggling.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.160]   And so I just started showing him basically everything
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.200]   I know and just doing like once every week,
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.000]   sometimes once every two weeks calls.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.360]   And he went from $10,000 a month on YouTube to over 400,000
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.880]   just doing these little counseling calls.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.360]   And so, I mean, people can make excuses all they want
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.560]   and say it's just luck or say, you know, well, anyways,
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.120]   I don't even want to quote all the other stuff,
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.240]   but it's just, it is, it is a teachable skill.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   It's a learnable skill.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.680]   You can study your way to consistently make viral videos,
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.560]   no matter how small your channel is.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.080]   Even if you have zero subscribers,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.440]   you could if you actually studied hard enough
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.180]   and like basically if you knew what I knew
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.760]   and some of these, so I don't sound so arrogant,
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.640]   also like some of these other friends that have that,
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.800]   I'd say are the smartest people in the world
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.480]   when it comes to content creation online.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.960]   If you had the knowledge that was in our heads,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.360]   you could do it very easily.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.000]   I see people do it all the time.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.400]   And what's even more interesting is I go on podcasts
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.600]   and I say everything I know
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.280]   and these people are also very open.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.320]   Some of them I know.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.640]   It's all out there.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.080]   And a lot of people, instead of just studying that
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.980]   and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way,
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.680]   they're just like, no, it's just luck, you know.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.920]   - So you do lay it all out there,
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.600]   but I gotta push back to one interesting thing.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.440]   I think a crucial component of your success
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.320]   is the idea stage, the idea generation.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.520]   The brainstorm I heard today,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.080]   but getting really good at generating ideas.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   So it's not just the selection of the thumbnail
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.460]   and the title, that creative process.
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:12.040]   It's also just the engine of generating really good ideas.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.080]   - Of course. - And getting that.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.280]   I mean, I would say that is probably the thing
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.440]   that needs to be trained the most for most creators, right?
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.160]   That they just don't put enough ideas on paper.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.600]   - Yes, but also a lot of creators also just don't,
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.240]   which I didn't either for the longest time,
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.440]   just don't make good enough content,
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.520]   content that's worthy of getting 10 million views.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.360]   - In the idea or the execution of the idea?
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.200]   - Both.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.920]   I mean, like think about how many people
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.500]   just make videos they film in under 20 minutes
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.240]   and they don't really put any effort into it.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.600]   It's like my first 500 videos
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.840]   didn't deserve to get a million views.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.760]   Like there's a reason they did.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.960]   They're terrible, you know what I mean?
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.720]   But at the time I thought they did, right?
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.840]   I'm in the mindset of a lot of small YouTubers
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.880]   where I thought those videos deserved a million views
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.120]   and I thought the algorithm hated me,
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.920]   but I watch them back now and I can tell you exactly why.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.360]   The videos were just fucking horrible.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.360]   - Well, so what was the breakthrough for you
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.720]   to start realizing, to start having a self-awareness
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.960]   about these videos aren't good enough?
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.640]   You're probably still going through that.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.120]   You're probably still growing to see.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.420]   - Yeah, every six months you should look back
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.400]   and hate your videos,
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.440]   or at least see things you could improve
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.760]   and be like, oh, I could have done this better, that better.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.840]   If not, then you're not learning quick enough,
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.960]   in my opinion, at least.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.280]   - Where's the source of that learning even for you now?
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.120]   Just look at the metrics?
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.480]   - I just got back from a mastermind
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.980]   where I just got like 10 of the smartest people I knew
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.880]   and we just locked ourselves in a cabin
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.200]   and taught each other stuff constantly every day.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.640]   Not every day now, probably every other day.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.320]   I go on a walk and I just call random people.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.760]   I'll just say, teach me something.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.080]   And I mean, it's just,
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.280]   you just have to have a never-ending thirst for learning.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.360]   That's very imperative, especially if you want,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.120]   like if you want to get on top and then stay on top.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.000]   The only way to do it is just to constantly be learning.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.160]   Or someone who is learning is just gonna,
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.560]   you know, have a leg up on you in the knowledge game.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.680]   - And what kind of stuff are you,
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.720]   'cause you've talked about offline
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.440]   that you just love learning of all kinds, doesn't matter.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.940]   But in terms of videos, are you studying videos?
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.960]   Are you studying?
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.040]   - Recently, not as much.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.640]   I'm more, 'cause to get to the videos I want,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.840]   I have to build this business and scale up and higher.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.780]   So more of my recent time has been,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.040]   like my teenage years were spent studying virality
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.320]   and studying content creation.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.640]   Now I'm studying how to build a content company
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.520]   so I can actually produce the crazy ideas I want to produce,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   if that makes any sense.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.080]   - So yeah, and that's the business side.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.160]   We talked about hiring.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.800]   Do you have trouble firing people?
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.960]   - No, I'm pretty sure almost every person,
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.400]   yeah, actually every person I've ever fired,
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.440]   we just give them severance.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.600]   And I like to see it more as, it's no ill will.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.080]   Like if I fired you, if there's some other job
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.380]   you want me to help you get, I'll DM them on Twitter.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.760]   Like, you know, if you want to go work for,
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.200]   I don't know, Insert whatever, MTV,
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.840]   give me someone to DM, I'll DM them.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.800]   Like, you know, I try to make it more like a transition
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.640]   and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.600]   - And then something was just not working for you,
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.640]   'cause you want people, like you said, super passionate.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.480]   - 'Cause at the end of the day,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.800]   if you hold someone that, onto someone
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.320]   that you don't see being here in 10 years,
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.400]   you're just doing them a disservice.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.920]   You're just giving them more in grain,
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.880]   more in rooted in where they are.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.040]   And the sooner you do it and help them move on
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.980]   to their new life, the better.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.080]   - Given all the wisdom you have now,
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.360]   if you were to give advice to somebody,
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.360]   or if you were to start over again, you had no money,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.880]   what would be the first 10 videos you tried to make
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.720]   on a new channel?
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.960]   I guess that's advice for a new person.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.880]   And nobody knows you.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.840]   - Yeah, nobody knows me.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.360]   Yeah, hypothetically, I have a mask on.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.600]   - And you also, I guess, don't have the wisdom.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.920]   - Well, if I don't have what I have in my head,
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.360]   then I would say just fail.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.840]   Like, just, a lot of people get analysis paralysis
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840]   and they'll just sit there
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.080]   and they'll plan their first video for three months.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.880]   And I'm, any of you listening, if you,
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.560]   especially if you have zero views on your channel,
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.120]   your first video is not gonna get views, period.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.240]   It's not, your first 10 are not gonna get views.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.800]   I can very confidently say that.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.560]   So stop sitting there and thinking for months and months
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.920]   on end and just get to work and start uploading.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.720]   Like, all you need to do,
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.640]   this applies to people who have not uploaded videos,
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.080]   but have dreams of being a YouTuber,
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.660]   is make a hundred videos and improve something every time.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.500]   Do that.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.680]   And then on your hundred and first video,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.080]   we'll start talking, like maybe you can get some views,
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.240]   but you know, your first hundred are gonna suck.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.040]   There are very freak cases like Liza Koshy
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.080]   or Emma Chamberlain who have really good personalities
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.760]   and it doesn't take them so as many videos.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.440]   And it's just like people who are seven foot five
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.280]   and making the NBA.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.320]   Like, yes, there are free cases you can find,
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.720]   but for the average person like us, you know,
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.680]   who don't have these exceptional personalities
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.500]   and, you know, backgrounds in filmmaking,
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.040]   just make a hundred videos, improve something each time,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.200]   and then talk to me on your hundred and first video.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.800]   - Well, the improve something each time is the tricky one.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.520]   How do you improve something each time?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.400]   The second one, just, I don't know,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.780]   put more effort into the script.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.860]   The third one, try to learn a new editing trick.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.820]   The fourth one, try to figure out a way
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.480]   that you can have better inflections in your voice.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.140]   The fifth one, try to, you know,
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.080]   study a new thumbnail tip and implement it.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.140]   The sixth one, try to figure out a new title.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.980]   There's infinite ways.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.760]   That's the beauty of content creation online.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.840]   There's literally infinite ways from the coloring,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.420]   to the frame rate, to the editing, to the filming,
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.320]   to the production, to the jokes, to the pacing,
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.120]   to every little thing can be improved
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.400]   and they can never not be improved.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.340]   There's literally no such thing as a perfect video.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.220]   - So if you knew everything you know now, but no money.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.180]   - Step one would, I'd just brainstorm like,
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.660]   okay, I don't have money.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.860]   What are some viral things?
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.540]   Like, I mean, the first thing that comes to my mind
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.260]   is something as simple as when I count to 100,000,
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.180]   which is what I did do when I was poor.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.420]   And like that worked, but like,
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.740]   what's something like that I could do
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.500]   that would be even more attention-gathering?
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.220]   - You were, as part of the brainstorm,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.860]   you would throw out a lot of ideas
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.460]   and people throw out a bunch of ideas.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.860]   And one of the questions is, is this even doable, right?
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.220]   - First off, come up with ideas you think would do well
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.020]   and then ask yourself later if they're doable.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.240]   'Cause there's different ways
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.760]   you can accomplish something.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.180]   - Don't be cynical about the doability of stuff.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.320]   - Yeah, because there really are so many different ways
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.380]   you can accomplish a goal.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.460]   Like when we give away an island,
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.180]   like we gave our 100 million subscriber an island.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.100]   You can't find private islands that don't look like shit
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.260]   for less than $10 million.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.660]   So this isn't doable, right?
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.360]   All right, the idea doesn't exist.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.180]   Not doable, X it off.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.300]   But then, you dig into it
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.840]   and you find different alternatives and you find, okay,
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.480]   what if we just buy a $2 million island that sucks
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.500]   and then spend a million dollars importing some sand,
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   let's build a beach, let's import 300 trees,
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.540]   let's build a little bit of canal, let's cut some paths.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.660]   Boom, now it's a really nice island,
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.980]   but it's actually affordable
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.500]   'cause we don't have $10 million to spend on a video,
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.340]   but we can afford to spend three and a half
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.500]   and lose whatever, a million dollars on that video.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.260]   So that's an example of like,
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.780]   yeah, if you just went off the gut test,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.220]   you'd be like, this isn't doable.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.020]   Every island's $10 million, we're screwed.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.180]   Like if we go cheaper, it's just a terrible island.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.020]   No.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.760]   And so if you, like,
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.060]   there are so many different ways
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:45.980]   you can achieve what you want.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.320]   You really got to push through notes,
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.660]   which not a lot of people do.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.360]   You have to have like a more of a dominant personality
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.820]   and just a willingness to,
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.900]   when people tell you it's not possible,
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.320]   just actually go through all the variables
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.920]   and eliminate them all yourself.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.580]   - Have a stubbornness and a resilience to failure maybe.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.700]   - For what we do and creators online,
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.180]   it's very imperative that you have,
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.140]   that a no isn't a no to you.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.940]   You really have to like think.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.420]   And just like, we take a personality test
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.460]   and like just having a dominant personality
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.540]   is a better indicator that when someone tells you,
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:20.980]   oh, there's no way you're going to build a brick wall
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.340]   for under a hundred grand, you'll be like, okay.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.220]   And then still go check the next 10 vendors
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.500]   and figure it out.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.340]   - Yeah.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.540]   What advice would you give to an already established channel
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.260]   like with one, two, three, four million subscribers,
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:39.260]   how to like 10X it, like increase it without losing maybe.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.980]   - Yeah, that's where it's very specific,
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.380]   like channel by channel.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.660]   You can't give general advice.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.660]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.920]   'Cause if I do, millions of creators are gonna see this
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.760]   and then they're gonna do it
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.700]   and I'm gonna fuck them over.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.060]   - Oh, I see, I see.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.900]   So let's say I'd like 2 million subscribers on this podcast.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.740]   - Yeah.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.980]   - Like how would you 10X that without sacrificing what it is?
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.980]   - 10X your stuff.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.820]   - Does it matter?
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.660]   So you've talked about what success.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.140]   - Yeah, it's different for everyone.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.580]   Like is 10Xing your definition of success?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.420]   - No.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.020]   - Well then it's gonna be, right off the bat it's hard
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.900]   because if you don't give a shit about 10Xing,
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.780]   it's even harder to 10X.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.780]   He does this because he likes helping people.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.740]   That's one thing I've found throughout this day.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.180]   Every time I talk data, it's so funny with him
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.700]   'cause it's like, you know, you could do this
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.780]   to get more views and he'll just be like blank.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.420]   I'll be like, that doesn't register anything.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.540]   He's just like, doesn't care, which is, it's really cool.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.620]   - I'm really nervous about that.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.220]   I'm really nervous about the numbers affecting
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.500]   'cause it's so fun.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.340]   - Oh yeah.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.580]   - It's so fun to focus on the numbers
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.340]   and I'm really worried about that.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.060]   But at the same time, you should be cognizant of that
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.460]   because you've created not just some of the most watched
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.280]   videos, but some of the most amazing videos ever.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.820]   So there's a strong correlation there.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.420]   It's not like you're selling your soul
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.220]   to make a highly viewed video.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.860]   It's actually, if you look at the metrics,
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.660]   it helps you understand what is compelling and not.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.000]   And so I feel like I am,
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.300]   I feel like there's some value to investigate
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.820]   what work, when people tune on and when not,
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.660]   to be more data-driven, even on podcasts.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.500]   But I'm really afraid of that.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.020]   - On the flip side, I think part of the appeal
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.220]   is that you don't care about that kind of stuff.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.400]   - But there could be stuff that doesn't have to do
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.220]   anything with that and it has to do with stylistic choices
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.860]   of lighting and cameras, or maybe with,
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.660]   for example, topics.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.020]   - Yeah.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.940]   Even what you've asked me here is different
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.980]   than what most people ask me.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.620]   - Yeah, so it could be, and it'd be nice to understand that.
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.100]   But again, I'm worried about polluting the creative process.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.260]   - At the end of the day, this is a true case
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.660]   of it's your own intuition.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.100]   You know your viewers better than anyone else.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.940]   It's whatever--
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:42.900]   - See, I'd like to push back on that.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.740]   I really don't.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.580]   - You do.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:45.400]   - I don't.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.240]   - Who else?
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.140]   Name one person who knows your viewers better than you.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.300]   - Somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts?
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.860]   - No, you know your viewers.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:54.540]   You know, you're the only, how many episodes have you done?
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.380]   - 350.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.200]   - Exactly.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.040]   - But I'm not paying attention--
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.660]   - You're the only one who's watched every second
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.980]   of all 350 of them, probably.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.300]   - That's just not, no, I haven't.
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.420]   But the--
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.020]   - Well, 'cause you did it, so you do know what's in all of 'em.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.660]   It's your content, it's you.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.700]   I'm telling you, you do, and this is just one
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.860]   of those moments where you're an intelligent guy
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.180]   and you just have to trust your instincts.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.740]   Just think, what is the typical ex-viewer,
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.660]   and what do they want?
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.300]   - I don't think like that.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.300]   - But that's all you would have to do.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.620]   And whatever your gut tells you,
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.460]   that would be the best guess.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.900]   - You don't know what the typical viewer is, though.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.540]   - I don't, 'cause to investigate that,
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.580]   it'd be very, very difficult.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.100]   And then you have to start looking at the numbers,
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.260]   you have to start to consider the demographics.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.980]   The only way I know that anybody even watches it
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.220]   is 'cause I'll sometimes run into people,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.740]   like when I run along the river,
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.420]   and they'd be like, "I love you, Lex."
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.540]   It's like, okay, well, that's a data point,
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.580]   and they're like cool people.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.420]   But I don't know, I don't have any other,
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.380]   it's difficult, man.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.900]   It's difficult to know who listens to "Boxes,"
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.460]   it's difficult to, do you have a sense
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.180]   of who's, I mean, you're so huge that everybody watches.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.780]   - Yeah, but no, I still do.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.580]   I'd say if you were to just put a gun to my head,
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.980]   and you're like, all right, we're gonna pick
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.020]   a random person that watched your last video,
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.940]   and you have to roughly guess what they are,
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.660]   and if you're not close, we'll kill you.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.260]   I would say probably a teenager that plays video games.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:19.220]   Like that would be probably the typical one.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.500]   And then there are people that are maybe
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.780]   a little bit younger, a lot of people
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.220]   that are older as well.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.380]   But in a random sample size, yeah,
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.860]   it's probably like a male boy that plays video games.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.500]   Like that's the best way I would describe it.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.760]   But I don't try to pertain to them.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.580]   I just make whatever I think is interesting
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.500]   and good content.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.700]   And this is what we were talking about before.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.820]   Even though, hypothetically, 35 to 40% of my audience
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.980]   is women, which is less than the majority,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.220]   if we get 100 million views a video,
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.900]   that's still 30 to 40 million females
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.780]   that watch every video, which is probably
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:51.220]   the largest views per video for women
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.900]   on the whole platform, which you wouldn't think that.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.940]   Like I can't think of a single other creator
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.460]   that gets more women to watch their videos than that.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.900]   And so it's just anything, even people above the age of 30,
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.940]   even if it's only like three or 4%,
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.980]   that's still three to 4% of 100 million views
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.280]   is a lot of people that age.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   So we hit a large group of kind of every demographic,
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.340]   if that makes any sense.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.140]   - So what if we look at other, maybe more challenging
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.380]   kinds of channels, or not, but if we look at educational,
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.940]   for example, like lectures, or if we look,
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.940]   yeah, educational, it could be short videos.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.900]   Like how would you 10x that?
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:32.100]   Like something on robotics, on biology,
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.420]   on science, on engineering, on all of that,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.820]   that's more educational focused.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.820]   - We would honestly just have to pull the,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.700]   'cause it's the same way, if you went to Gordon Ramsay
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.260]   and you said, "How would a new cook cook better?"
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.660]   You know, it's like--
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.980]   - Even then, that's not even specific,
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.020]   you have to go channel by channel.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.580]   - You really do, or I'm giving horrible advice.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.300]   Because if there was these just golden rules,
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.660]   everyone would do it, you know what I mean?
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.980]   Like if there's these magical little principles.
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.780]   - How quickly, when you look at a channel,
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.540]   can you kind of give advice?
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.860]   - Yeah, it's like surface level at the start,
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.340]   and then the more, if we watch 10 videos,
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.780]   I feel like I'd have a good profile,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.140]   and I could tell you, in my opinion,
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.500]   especially once I look at the analytics
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.660]   and I get more ingrained in like,
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.900]   okay, the typical viewer's this, they're from here,
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.700]   here's how they're feeling, you know?
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.540]   'Cause there are people who make videos for rednecks,
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.900]   and like the rednecks' taste of content
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.020]   is just so much different than, obviously,
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.100]   women watching makeup videos,
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.060]   which are so much different than, you know,
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.980]   teenage boys watching a Minecraft video.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   They're just all different.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.420]   So the biggest thing you have to do
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.780]   is put your head in the headspace of the viewer
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.380]   and see the content how they would.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.300]   'Cause if you just try to only give your taste,
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.500]   which is what a lot of people do,
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.940]   and things from your perspective, it's very biased,
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.100]   and it's just not gonna work for everyone.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.740]   And that's actually how you do more harm than good,
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.480]   which is something I'm very careful of.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.540]   - Yeah, but at the same time,
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.700]   it's just generating a lot of ideas.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.140]   I think the first time I've talked to you
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.740]   was on Clubhouse, actually.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.700]   And I mentioned something about robots,
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.860]   and like almost immediately,
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.740]   you went to generating a bunch of ideas around robots.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.340]   - Oh yeah, easily.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.980]   100 robots versus 100 humans.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.340]   Yeah, how far can a robot throw a potato?
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.140]   - I think your idea, like, I think the first idea
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.500]   was because you just said so many ideas
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.420]   I never even thought of.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.620]   But it shows the value of basically brainstorming
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.820]   with people that think differently.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.700]   - But at the end of the day, my ideas are probably,
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.460]   you know, might lean towards some people
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.540]   a little bit younger than your audience.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.660]   Like some of the stuff I'm-- - Could be.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.620]   - Yeah. - But there's still ideas.
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.820]   Like I think the first one you said,
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.500]   'cause we're talking about a quadruped,
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.500]   like robot dogs, you said to replace a biological dog
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.820]   with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.220]   You were just quickly brainstorming
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.060]   different ideas of like how--
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.860]   - This was years ago, I remember it now.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.820]   Yeah. (Lex laughs)
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.420]   - Which is just, I mean, it's like, oh yeah,
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.380]   I never really thought about that kind of,
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.260]   sort of, it's the basic, the tension between
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.420]   what does it take for a robot and an AI system
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.700]   to replace the biological systems that we,
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.860]   the biological creatures that we love in our lives.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:51.260]   - Yeah, and but like that was like the pace
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:55.740]   of idea generation was the thing that struck me.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.540]   Today and in general, it's like that's how you get
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.580]   at good videos is you keep--
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.620]   - It's much easier to make a video around a good idea,
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.260]   obviously, than a bad one.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.100]   You just send yourself up for success.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.340]   - Okay, so that's for 10xing a really popular channel.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.340]   What's the hardest number?
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.020]   You said the numbers that matters,
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.900]   click-through rate, average view duration, and surveys.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.660]   What's the hardest number to optimize for?
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.220]   - Probably surveys, you know.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.500]   - Do you have any insight into the surveys at all?
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.460]   - No, not really, but if you just click
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.660]   on a bunch of random videos online,
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.960]   you'll eventually get a survey.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.780]   What's this video transformative, heartwarming, inspiring?
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.380]   What people rate does make a difference?
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.540]   And it's like you can get people to click a video,
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540]   you can get them to watch it,
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.740]   but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.100]   Like they don't lie, the surveys, you know?
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.740]   Maybe one person here and there might troll,
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.460]   but once you aggregate enough,
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.500]   it's a pretty clear telltale of the video.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.460]   So either you're making a great video or you're not.
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.300]   - What is it?
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.340]   Minimizing the non-regrettability.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.060]   - Yeah, I think Elon tweeted that.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.460]   That's what he's trying to do on Twitter.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.580]   - For Twitter, and that's interesting.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.220]   That's basically the survey metric,
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.780]   how happy you are that you've been using the platform.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.420]   - Yeah, Elon tweeted, "We want to limit the amount
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.980]   "of regrettable minutes people spend on Twitter."
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.500]   And the first thing I thought, it's like,
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.100]   that's something YouTube already has unlocked.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.060]   Like their whole survey system and feedback loop.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.460]   - How tough is it to take on YouTube, you think?
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.300]   - For Twitter?
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.660]   - Yeah, for Twitter, for anybody else.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.420]   - I mean, it's gonna be basically impossible.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.020]   I mean, YouTube's not going anywhere.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.580]   And I don't know, I don't think anyone's gonna do
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   what YouTube does better than them,
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.260]   at least not in the next 10 years.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:41.260]   - You asked on Twitter, "Would you rather have $10 million
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.060]   "or 10 million subscribers on YouTube?"
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.820]   What would your own answer be
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.580]   at various stages in your career?
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.580]   - If I had nothing, I would say $10 million.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.220]   Because with $10 million, you can hire some people
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.420]   and pump out content with like a million or two,
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.500]   get 10 million subscribers,
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.220]   and then keep the other eight million.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.380]   - So that's if you believe in your ability
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.340]   to grow a channel, if you--
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.060]   - Well, yeah, if you don't believe in your ability
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.940]   to grow a channel, then you shouldn't take
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.140]   the 10 million subscribers,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.820]   'cause you're just gonna kill the channel.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.580]   So the 10 million is definitely,
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.740]   a better question would be,
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.180]   would you rather have a million dollars
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.100]   or 10 million subscribers?
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.620]   That's where it gets a little tricky.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.660]   'Cause now it's like, hmm,
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.380]   a million dollars, life-changing amount of money.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.260]   But if you semi-know what you're doing,
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.580]   you'd probably make a million dollars
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.780]   off a 10 million subscriber channel,
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.620]   but there's a little bit of risk.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.380]   - A million dollars might not be enough
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.980]   to build a strong team,
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.020]   'cause you don't know how to do it,
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.260]   so you might waste all of that money.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.420]   - Yeah, or they just keep it and retire, yeah.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:39.260]   - Okay, that's true.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.580]   - Yeah, 'cause 10 million's just so high,
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.620]   it's like, just never work again, who cares?
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.660]   For the average human, that's so much money.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.140]   - It's interesting to me also to the value
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.580]   of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.100]   I suppose, how valuable is the subscriber for,
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.740]   like what percentage of the videos,
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:58.540]   like how active are the subscribers in watching the video?
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.300]   For you.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.380]   - That's hard, I don't know.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.700]   I was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.380]   Like if someone has 10 million subscribers,
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.780]   have they made 10 million dollars?
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.740]   I don't know why that kind of popped in my head.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.260]   It's an interesting thought.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:16.060]   - Do you ever, when you analyze videos,
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.180]   do you ever analyze videos,
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.900]   like we've talked about offline,
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.820]   of other videos across YouTube in general
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.940]   to understand trends, to understand social behavior?
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.420]   - Well, all your, not all,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.780]   but a lot of the questions are analytics-based.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.620]   - Yeah.
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.820]   - Yeah, it's so funny. - 'Cause I love it.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.860]   I mean, it's just a giant social experiment, right?
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.140]   Like what people like to watch, what people share.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.140]   - Yeah. - It's like a fascinating--
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.620]   - So, like I said before,
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.260]   what percentage of your audience do you think
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.660]   care about this kind of stuff?
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.340]   Like this deeply about YouTube analytics?
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.980]   - I think a large amount care about curiosity
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.700]   and exploration of interesting ideas.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.060]   So in that sense-- - This would fit it.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.140]   - Yeah, this would fit it.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.060]   I love it.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:56.900]   This is funny.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.940]   And this isn't me like trying to make,
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.780]   I love you. - Yeah, I love you too.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.580]   - And I actually, I loved your Magnus one,
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.220]   and even your Hikaru one was really good,
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.060]   and a bunch of other ones.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.460]   But I think we're getting to the point now
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.940]   where only analytics junkies
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.940]   would want to keep hearing more analytics talk.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.460]   And the normie is probably like,
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.060]   they've had their dose of YouTube talk
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.940]   for the next three years.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.780]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.620]   Hey, comment if I'm wrong.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.460]   I could be.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.300]   I don't know your audience.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.420]   See, this is where you would tell me,
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.020]   "Shut up, I know my audience, you dumbass."
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.500]   - And I don't at all.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.980]   I actually, I just follow the thread of curiosity.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   And I think there's just a lot of curious humans
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.860]   in the world.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.740]   And to me, it's like,
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.700]   so the question about analytics
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.460]   is the question of basically stepping away,
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.060]   stepping outside of yourself,
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.300]   and thinking, "Why the hell do I like TikTok so much?
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.600]   "Why do I like Twitter so much?
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.620]   "Why do I like YouTube so much?"
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.060]   And getting, even if you're not a creator,
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.900]   getting an insight into that is really interesting.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.180]   It's like, what,
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:58.260]   'cause all these platforms are fundamentally changing
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.780]   the nature of content.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.980]   People are reading books less.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:03.540]   They're probably going to be watching movies less and less.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.660]   They're probably going to be watching Netflix less and less.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.180]   - Do you ever think about the sort of the darker side
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.820]   of YouTube and with shadow banning and censorship
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.100]   and all that kind of topics,
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.180]   especially if you see it in other platforms like Twitter,
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   that Elon recently highlighted the shadow banning
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:24.020]   that was happening, and in general,
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.180]   the censorship that was happening on those platforms.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.140]   Do you think about the role of centralized control
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.380]   of which information is or isn't made available
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.980]   through search and discovery?
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.140]   - I'll be honest.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.740]   I never really think about it.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.260]   (laughs)
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.420]   - You just try to make fun videos.
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.220]   - Yeah, I'm kind of more in my own lane,
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.580]   but it's not that I don't just specifically think about it.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.420]   I just like a lot of stuff in general.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.300]   Like, I'm just kind of in my own lane
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.180]   thinking about my own stuff.
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.540]   But now that you asked, I'm curious.
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.820]   What are your thoughts on YouTube and that kind of stuff?
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:00.700]   - Well, I'm generally against centralized censorship
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.540]   or shadow banning.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.860]   Shadow banning is the worst one
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.580]   because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.180]   where you're having great conversations
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.600]   and videos that are not spreading misinformation,
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.780]   that sounds like an admirable goal,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.200]   but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.220]   That's too big of a responsibility.
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:20.380]   - Yeah, and there's the misinformation stuff,
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.300]   and then there's also just like the videos
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.860]   where they do something that causes,
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:28.820]   what happened back in the day, the adpocalypse.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.760]   You know, a lot of creators' revenue plummets
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.040]   because people are doing videos
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.580]   that advertisers don't deem acceptable,
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.960]   and then now all these big advertisers are pulling,
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.020]   and the little guys are getting hit
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.540]   because ad rates dropped by 30%,
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.700]   and the person who just quit his job
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.580]   to go full-time content creation now can't sustain it.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.740]   So it's also, it's like a lot of different variables as well
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.500]   that makes it so complicated.
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.100]   - Well, I think the big thing is transparency,
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.580]   especially around shadow banning for people.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.420]   - I agree.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.340]   On shadow banning, you should be transparent.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.700]   You should let people know.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.040]   Obviously, there has to be some type of controls.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.520]   People can't just post whatever,
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.400]   and so if you're pulling those levers,
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.960]   they should at least know.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:09.320]   - Yeah, so they know how to improve their content,
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.480]   they can understand it, they can--
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.660]   - Exactly.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.120]   - If it's a wrong shadow banning,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.240]   like as a society, we should not shadow ban
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.720]   this kind of content, that means--
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.560]   - Exactly.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.880]   - You should be publicly discussing it and having that--
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.780]   - 'Cause if not, and if it's not known,
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.920]   then it's just kind of like,
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.280]   well, then who's pulling the strings,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.000]   and how do we know they're not just manipulating things
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.120]   to get whatever message they want out there
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.380]   and silence other ones?
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.100]   - Yeah, and there could be sort of in the background
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.420]   government influence, which is where actual freedom
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.980]   of speech comes into play, that the government
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.900]   should not have any control or be able to put pressure
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.640]   on censorship of speech, and it gets weird
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.700]   if none of that is being, there's no transparency
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.540]   around it, you know?
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.380]   - Exactly.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:50.500]   - But to be fair, that's a huge responsibility.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.340]   The amount of content that YouTube,
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.620]   is uploaded on YouTube, that is shared by YouTube,
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:57.460]   viewed by YouTube--
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.800]   - More of a reason why it would probably make sense
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.840]   to be transparent, you know?
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.680]   - Yeah.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.760]   - Because then people can help fact check it.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.140]   - That's right, but that requires building a platform
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.920]   that makes that easy, right?
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.920]   Like to make fact checking easy, to make the,
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.420]   like Twitter now has like being able to share context
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.700]   and all that kind of stuff, that crowdsource it,
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.840]   crowdsource it the way Wikipedia crowdsource it.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.280]   I mean, there's, it's, right.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.200]   - And then you open a random Wikipedia article.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.600]   (both laughing)
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.960]   - But like, you know, people criticize Wikipedia
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.240]   because there is a political lean
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.400]   to the editors of Wikipedia, and then they get,
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.760]   there's some articles that definitely have a bias to them
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.600]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.040]   It's a difficult problem, it's a difficult problem to solve
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.280]   that ultimately, as much as possible, it would be nice
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.920]   for the viewer to have control of that
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.440]   versus the entity that's hosting it.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.280]   So for the viewer to decide--
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.560]   - I'll let you figure that stuff out.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.800]   I'm just gonna make fun--
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.640]   - Cool videos?
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.620]   - You know, let's go to Antarctica again.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.460]   How was that?
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.880]   How was going to, you just came back from Antarctica.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   That was, I watched the video.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.560]   That was, that was fun.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.720]   That was a really fun video.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:02.560]   - Thank you.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.920]   - There's, I mean, there's a lot of things
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.520]   I can comment about that, but what was that,
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.760]   what was the hardest part of making that video?
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.680]   - The hardest part was just getting out there.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.600]   It's just so remote.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.640]   And, you know, you land the plane on just this ice runway
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.720]   and it's so sketchy, and then once the plane takes off,
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.000]   you're just there.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.260]   You're the most remote place on the planet.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.840]   And it's just, it's very breathtaking.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.960]   I don't, if you have the chance to ever go to Antarctica,
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.840]   I would recommend it.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.480]   It was probably like the, in the video we climbed a mountain
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.120]   that wasn't named, so we can name it.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.640]   And like standing on top of that mountain
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.960]   and just seeing, kind of like nothing.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.200]   'Cause once you get outside the outskirts
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.360]   and you get deep in Antarctica, there's no penguins.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   Nothing lives there at all.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.440]   And so there's just nothing in every direction.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.120]   It's just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.100]   and some of them stick into the clouds
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.120]   and if you go during summertime, the sun never goes down.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.580]   So the sun's up 24/7 and it's just like spinning
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.600]   in circles at the top of the planet or whatever.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.240]   It looks like the top.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.520]   - Yeah, you guys commented several times
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.360]   how beautiful it was.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.080]   - Yeah, and so it's just, yeah, it was just very beautiful.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.100]   - What about shooting itself,
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.120]   like the technical aspects of shooting it?
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.840]   - Oh, I mean, well, so somehow we lucked out.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.960]   One of the days was like the warmest day in like forever
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.040]   that's been in Antarctica.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.280]   It was like, it was positive degrees.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.200]   But at certain parts, it was also like negative 20,
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.640]   negative 30 and that's where the cameras,
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.440]   you constantly have to be switching out the batteries
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.760]   and heating them up and like putting them basically
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.480]   in like your pants or they'll just get way too cold.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.940]   And we were prepared for much worse,
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.360]   but it ended up being much better than we thought.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.600]   - So for that video, but in general,
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.960]   maybe some other challenging videos,
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.400]   how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.240]   to the final video?
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.880]   Can you take me through like a full process of,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.920]   like we're talking about some crazy wild ideas today.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.080]   How do you go from that to a final video
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.200]   where you click publish?
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.400]   - Well, I mean, obviously first things first,
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.880]   you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.800]   I mean, pick any video you can think of on my channel.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.100]   I can take you through it.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:06.300]   - Well, what about the, in a circle,
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.160]   you have to stay in a circle for 100 days.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.440]   - Yeah, so for that one, step one.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.480]   - One of the most popular.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.120]   - Yeah, that video did really well.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.360]   So we, problem is we have to,
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.280]   this is where you get really into the nuances
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.960]   of the company 'cause we have a lot of videos going out.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.680]   You can't just in a vacuum be like,
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.040]   all right, we're not doing anything for 100 days,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.080]   we're only filming this.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.320]   So step one is we had to build an independent crew
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.180]   that could actually do that for 100 days.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.400]   That way everyone else could keep working
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.400]   on the normal videos and not just screw everything up.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.540]   So step one, you build that team.
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.800]   Okay, we got the team.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.720]   Now what do we need?
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.360]   Well, to do this, we need probably like 10 cameras,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.680]   at least rolling at all times.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.160]   So we're probably gonna need to get a trailer
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.440]   and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.280]   to just carry the sheer volume of footage we're gonna have.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.000]   And so get a trailer, set up the cameras,
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.560]   go out in the field, paint a circle.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.000]   Now we need a house, go buy a house, bring it out there.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.760]   And then it's like, oh wait, I think it'd be funny
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.080]   if I brought the house in on the intro.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.720]   Find a crane that can lift up a house
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.720]   so I can drive it in and drop it in the intro.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.200]   - And that's like an iterative process
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.600]   where you're like, okay, this would be funnier.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.320]   So this is not all upfront that you just written.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.920]   - Yeah, ideally it would be,
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.340]   but as you kind of see things, you get inspired
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.760]   and then you think of more and more.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.680]   - This would be better with a crane.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.600]   - Yeah, it'd be better if I dropped out of the house.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.000]   - Drop it, yeah.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.380]   That was crazy that you decided to do that.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.440]   So fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you're willing to do.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.360]   - Exactly, I'm a broken record,
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.280]   but whatever makes the best video possible.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.900]   That's all you focus on.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:38.200]   - Okay, so what about the delegation of like,
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.440]   who gets to, what are the cameramen,
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.800]   like the people operating the cameras,
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.520]   who's responsible for different things?
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.520]   Is it like a distributed process?
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.120]   - No, that's where whoever the lead cam
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.640]   would be on that video would just decide it.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.400]   That one, 'cause we shot over a hundred days,
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.800]   we didn't, a lot of it was just Sean,
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.640]   the guy who was in the circle, just vlogging.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.720]   We just gave him a camera and he figured it out.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.600]   And then we'd have like for him just set hours each day
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.600]   that a cameraman would come.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.040]   So if he had any content, he needed extra hands.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.360]   Instead of just having someone on standby 24/7,
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.880]   it made more sense to do set hours.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.200]   - Nice.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.120]   - And yeah, it was hard, but explaining it in hindsight,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120]   it sounds so simple.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.960]   - And I guess like the more,
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.040]   'cause that one is relatively simple, I guess,
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.800]   because it's a low number of people.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.720]   - Yeah, the hard part about that is just the time.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.240]   Like, you know, I checked in on them so many different days
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.560]   and it's like an hour here, two hours there,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.600]   three hours there, over a hundred days
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.480]   adds up to be a ton of time.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.320]   And even then, like, you know, if you have a 10 person crew,
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.400]   you know, paying them daily rates for a hundred days,
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.040]   it just, all of it adds up.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.840]   - What about like the hundred versus hundred,
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.960]   hundred adults versus hundred kids?
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.720]   What was bringing that to life?
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.440]   That seems like exceptionally challenging.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.040]   - Yeah, basically the thought process was
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.800]   we did a hundred boys versus hundred girls.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.640]   People loved it.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.680]   Honestly, I didn't think they'd like it as much as they did.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.200]   Video did really, really well.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.880]   So the second I saw that video was crushing,
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.640]   I was like, all right, we're doing it again.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.400]   But last time we did it, we did in our studio.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.360]   So we built a giant room, put a hundred girls in it.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.080]   Sounds bad when I explain it like this.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.520]   And then a giant room put a hundred boys.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.000]   And we're like, after a hundred hours,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.080]   whichever room has the most people,
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.400]   we'll give them half a million dollars.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   So it did well.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.120]   So we're like, all right, we're gonna do it again.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.920]   So we threw out all these different ideas.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.480]   It was like a hundred football players
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.440]   versus a hundred cheerleaders,
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.520]   a hundred this, a hundred that,
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.000]   a hundred prisoners versus a hundred cops.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.520]   Just craziest ideas.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:29.880]   And we settled on a hundred kids versus a hundred adults.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.160]   And then the next step was like, how do we make it better?
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.680]   The kids versus adults, or the, sorry,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.040]   boys versus girls, the first one we did was inside.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.400]   And the problem was every time it was night,
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.760]   when we did these long time lapses,
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.480]   you couldn't see the sun go up and down.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.440]   So we're like, okay, this time I want to do it outside.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.320]   So the cubes are outside.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.960]   And instead of doing circles, we want to make them cubes.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.080]   And then, you know, it was figuring out,
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.920]   do we want the, yeah, just.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.560]   - Those videos came up at least today
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.560]   as ones that are like really complicated
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.880]   in terms of the audio, in terms of how to film it.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.760]   - Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.040]   We had a lot of audio issues
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.560]   'cause in the first one, we didn't have a roof on it.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.280]   The second one, there was a roof.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.520]   So there's a lot of reverb,
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.480]   which then in editing made it brutal.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.600]   Like half the shots weren't usable
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.760]   and it really screwed us over.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.400]   So we had to do a lot of Frankensteining
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.120]   in the editing to make up for basically my ignorance.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.640]   - So you mentioned that you were surprised
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.000]   how well that one did.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.120]   A lot of creators talk about getting depressed
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.160]   when the videos don't do as well as they kind of expected.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.920]   There's a kind of feeling
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.720]   you can get really worn out by that.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.480]   Do you yourself feel that?
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:38.280]   And also, do you have advice for others that feel this?
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.280]   - Yeah, it's weird 'cause I am a numbers guy,
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.520]   but also it used to.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.680]   It used to very much,
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.200]   especially when I was like betting
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.440]   everything I had on a video.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.880]   When it did bad, I was devastated, man.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.800]   I'd cry and I'd be depressed for days
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.280]   and it really would have a severe impact on my mood.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.640]   But I don't know, now it doesn't really matter.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.280]   If a video does bad, I just look at it
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.880]   and I'm like, "Oh, why'd this video do bad?"
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.200]   Probably, "Oh, there's a little retention dip there.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.480]   "I don't think people like the thumbnail.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.320]   "Maybe we should switch it."
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.680]   And I just look at it objectively, unemotional,
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.000]   and then just move on.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.160]   And I feel like that's a much healthier way
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.000]   of going about it.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.960]   So if a creator is listening,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.040]   that is the ideal way to respond to a video
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:19.880]   that's doing bad.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.760]   Just remove emotion from the equation
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.200]   and just look at it and figure out
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.160]   how you can improve the next one.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.960]   - Is there tricks to being able to detach yourself
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.360]   from that?
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.720]   Because in your case, that's true for creators,
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.360]   but in your case, there's a lot of money on the line.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.320]   - Yeah, well, months of my life and so much time.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.160]   But no, I mean, you just, I don't know.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.240]   The only real answer is it's just a conscious effort.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.680]   You just have to unemotionally look at the video,
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.800]   determine the problems, and then move on.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.600]   There is no secret, you know what I mean?
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.960]   It's just, it's that.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.560]   And if you really can't bring yourself to do it,
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.680]   then you're just screwed.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.720]   Honestly, maybe you're not meant for this game.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.760]   - Okay, so that's part of the development as a creator
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.240]   is being able to detach yourself.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.480]   - For longevity, yes, yeah.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.040]   You have to unemotionally be able to look at videos
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.840]   that flop and figure it out.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.680]   'Cause if not, just getting,
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.200]   and not every video can be a one out of 10.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.240]   And so when a video does bad,
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.640]   you know, that just stress and depression,
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.760]   it's just gonna eventually get to you in the long run.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.420]   - So you said you've failed in a bunch of videos,
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.720]   sort of taking them to completion.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.280]   So what are some of the biggest fails?
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   - Yeah, weirdly enough, as we've matured
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.120]   and we've done this more,
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.480]   we don't have that problem as much,
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.320]   especially now that we're getting
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.320]   into the multimillion dollar budgets per video.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.000]   It's like, failure's not really an option anymore.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.280]   So I'm a little more particular about what I do,
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.040]   but back in the day, yeah, like we would do a video
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.840]   where we spent 24 hours on a deserted island
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.800]   and we filmed it, did it all,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.360]   and I just, I didn't like it after the edit.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.760]   So I just grabbed the voice
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.240]   and we went back to the deserted island
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.680]   and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.560]   Or--
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.080]   - Could that have been caught
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.880]   and prevented at the idea stage?
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.720]   Like where--
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.640]   - No, it was a good idea.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.680]   It was just poor execution.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.160]   To be honest, when we were out there, it was hot.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.480]   We were just like, we all at one point
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.440]   just kind of wanted to die.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.400]   It was just miserable.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.000]   - So how do you avoid that these days?
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.680]   - Well, I just went when it was a little cooler,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.520]   to be honest.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.480]   And then we had, literally, the amount of fun we had
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.160]   in the video was like 10 times higher.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.120]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.920]   So you, like, there's some practical details
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.760]   that you just learned.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.600]   - Yeah, I don't--
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.440]   - What it takes to do--
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.160]   - Videos that where it's very hot or it's on water,
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.640]   'cause I get super seasick,
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.720]   there's like a, kind of like 10 things
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.240]   that if they have these variables, I'm down to do it,
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:33.000]   but my fun meter is not as high as normal.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   (laughs)
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.520]   Like, we tried to, anytime we do anything on a boat,
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.240]   like when we spent 24 hours in a Bermuda Triangle,
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.640]   or when I tried to spend like, which it didn't get uploaded,
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.520]   but I tried to spend like 100 hours at sea or whatever,
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.760]   just like on a raft, it just like,
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.760]   it makes me want to throw up and I get so seasick,
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.160]   I can't even see straight.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.520]   But there are just some videos that require me
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.120]   to be on a boat, so I just suck it up.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.560]   - So when you spend months in creating a video,
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.120]   I know this is probably stressful to some creators,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.320]   like how much stress, how do you feel
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.360]   when you have to click publish a video?
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.200]   - Now, not much.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.440]   - So you're able to detach yourself from it?
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:12.160]   - Yeah, again, in old me, tons.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.880]   I mean, I'd be like scratching and nervous
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.200]   and like my hands would be sweating,
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.960]   like to the point where I'm almost about to puke,
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.760]   I'm like, "I really hope people like this."
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.840]   But, you know, I don't know,
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.160]   I think that's just part of maturing it.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.760]   There's different, as a content creator,
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.680]   there's different phases.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.920]   And you just like, once you get over the fear
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.520]   that you're just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant,
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.880]   and you just accept that, like you believe in yourself
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.920]   and you believe in your content
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.520]   and that you can continue to be relevant,
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.720]   then you don't, I don't know, you kinda,
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.320]   it's a little bit easier to detach yourself, I guess.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.240]   And that's, it's a much healthier place to be.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.680]   You can't do this for 10 years
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.880]   if every little thing just causes
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.320]   these huge emotional reactions.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.160]   It's like, that's why a lot of creators
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.560]   go a little mentally insane.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.120]   You have to get out of that game
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.440]   'cause it really messes with you.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.680]   - We've talked about this a little bit,
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   but how do you define and how do you suggest
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.520]   others define success on YouTube?
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   - It's so subjective.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.560]   Some people, success is retiring their mom.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.800]   For you, success is inspiring people
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.000]   and educating them and, you know, whatever,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.400]   the peak of their curiosity.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.640]   For other people, it's just quitting their job.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.560]   - So you have to self-reflect
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.120]   on what your definition of success is.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.320]   'Cause I think a lot of creators kinda
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.660]   don't really think, don't introspect.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.620]   Like, they kinda wanna keep getting more
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.620]   and more subscribers kinda thing.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.420]   - Yeah, but subscribers is just a vanity metric.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.140]   You know, it doesn't,
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.980]   subscribers don't correlate to views.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.180]   - Sure, or views, whatever.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.580]   - Yeah, I know, but that's more,
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.420]   that was a direct to you,
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:45.740]   that was more direct to people listening
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.220]   'cause a lot of people do really care about subscribers
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.700]   or even followers, like on TikTok.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.500]   But if you look, like, your view,
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.820]   on YouTube, very, very few percent,
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.820]   if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.980]   Right, they're almost all home feed or suggested.
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:00.900]   When's the last time you clicked
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.740]   on your sub feed to watch a video?
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.780]   - Oh, almost never, yeah.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:04.940]   - Yeah, maybe five years ago.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.200]   It used to be a thing, it's not anymore.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.500]   No one does.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.340]   And it's getting harder and harder to find.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.180]   - I subscribe to way too many channels, I think.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.700]   - Yeah, that's what everyone does.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.620]   And you subscribe to 10 channels, they're great,
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.060]   but two years later, your taste evolves
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.260]   and it's a mess.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:21.140]   And so, subscribers don't really matter.
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.140]   Followers on TikTok don't really matter.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.700]   So anyways, they really are the definition
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.660]   of a vanity metric.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:30.420]   - And, but what about views?
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.340]   - They do, obviously, 'cause if people are showing up
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.180]   time and time again, that's what matters.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.820]   - Okay, so that's a good thing to define a success.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.260]   I just feel like that too can be a problem.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:48.260]   'Cause I would say, you know, if I wanted to be successful,
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.060]   like as a young creator, I might start copying Mr. Beast
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:53.100]   or something like that, right?
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:53.940]   - Yeah.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.540]   - You start trying to take shortcuts
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:59.540]   as opposed to find your own unique voice, right?
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:03.500]   So like chasing views is a problem too, it feels like.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.500]   Or no, as long as you detach yourself from them.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.100]   - I mean, if you're, sounds about right,
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.620]   but if you're lazy, yeah, and you just wanna copy
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.020]   someone else and not experiment and find your own way.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.660]   But I mean, you can't make that excuse for them.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.420]   If someone just isn't coming up with the original stuff
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.620]   and putting in the effort, you can't just say,
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.300]   oh, it's 'cause they're chasing views,
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.900]   we need some different metric for them to chase.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.860]   No, they just need to find their own way.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:28.740]   - I mean, it just feels like unique type of content
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.620]   will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.300]   in the short term.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.700]   - By the long term, you win.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.940]   - Okay.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.700]   - Or if you do win, you win more,
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:41.220]   I guess would be a better way of putting it.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.100]   - Do you think you will IPO Mr. Beast Burger
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.540]   or Feastables in the next five, 10 years?
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:47.740]   - Beast Burger or Feastables?
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.300]   No, I kinda think, actually, you know what?
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.540]   I just realized, this is our first time talking
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.820]   about those, we're like an hour and a half in,
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.660]   that's so funny.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.220]   - We started talking about what?
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.820]   - My retention brain kicked in.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.540]   (both laughing)
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.620]   - I wonder if you have retention brain for life itself.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.140]   - Oh, I do, every time I'm talking to someone,
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.140]   I'm like, okay, I'm wondering--
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.420]   - What about loved ones?
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:15.020]   Spending time with loved ones, thinking we could be doing
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.540]   something much better right now.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:18.800]   - Yes, no, that is a serious problem.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.020]   So we'll pause the Beast Burger question, yes.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.740]   But that's why my current girlfriend,
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:27.340]   which I was telling you before when we were talking
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:30.500]   about this, is she has a genuine love for learning.
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.900]   And that's something I have, I always feel like I need
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.540]   to be learning something to justify the time I'm spending.
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:38.180]   And so that's why it's such a nice trait,
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:41.340]   because I feel like that time is being used optimally,
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.220]   because whether we're watching a documentary
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:46.660]   or we're going and taking an IQ test or reading
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.180]   about whatever, just why modern art is a thing,
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.420]   I don't know, whatever weird thing we decide to do,
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.420]   I'm always learning and improving, so it justifies the time.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.900]   - So to maximize retention in your relationship,
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:00.300]   you want to spend that time learning as much as possible.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.100]   - Yeah, which conveniently, I don't have to force, right?
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:07.140]   Or I want to be recharging, so when I do work,
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.780]   I can hit the ground harder, and luckily,
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.140]   we're into a lot of the same things,
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.380]   which happen to be learning, and sometimes it's not learning,
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:16.300]   like maybe watching an anime or something like that.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.820]   But I'm a big believer in you're either,
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.300]   if you, well, if your goal is to be
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.180]   like a super successful entrepreneur,
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.740]   you need to either be working,
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:27.100]   or you need to be doing something that decompresses
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.620]   and recharges you so you can work again,
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.740]   if your goal is to be like a really kick-ass entrepreneur.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.620]   Obviously, we're boiling this down to a very basic thing.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.420]   And so the things you're doing, your downtime,
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.180]   when you're not working, if it doesn't recharge you,
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.660]   you're screwed, you're just a ticking time bomb
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.940]   waiting to implode.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.660]   And so you got to heavily recharge.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.380]   So like watching, for me, anime or whatever it is,
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.060]   playing a board game, like that is actually
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.460]   kind of crucial to my success,
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.980]   which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion,
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.300]   because I used to be the kind of guy
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.340]   that wanted to work every hour of the day,
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.580]   and I would try to train myself to not need that stuff.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:09.060]   And I almost resented like that,
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:10.940]   I have to do these kinds of things,
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.660]   and it would piss me off 'cause it's not optimal,
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.460]   and I just really want to make content
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.780]   and entertain people.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:18.420]   But as someone who's gone down that road,
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:21.620]   and you just work every day for two, three months straight,
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.980]   and every hour of the day,
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.420]   and then you're just a bomb waiting to explode
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:26.580]   and lose your mind.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.500]   And the only real sustainable thing
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:31.180]   is to just like give yourself time to recharge
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.500]   in between working.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.940]   - So there's a kind of balance you have to find.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:38.260]   - You have to, and I hate it more than anyone else.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.860]   - You hate not working.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.460]   - Yeah, it's 'cause it's just not optimal for time.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.860]   Like it's, as a human, I do need to occasionally
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:51.100]   watch a mindless show and play a board game.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.500]   And it took me a very long time
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.460]   to like come to peace with that and not,
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.140]   I would have like borderline panic attacks when I do it,
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:00.260]   'cause I'm like, I just, what am I doing right now?
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.180]   Why am I doing this?
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.220]   I should be, you know, like,
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.060]   what if one day I have to lay off an employee
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.340]   because we're not doing so well?
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.940]   Like, how could I justify watching this show
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.020]   or whatever I'm doing right now?
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.060]   You know, it's like, there's a lot of things like that
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.340]   that go on in your head, but it's necessary.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:16.980]   - Before we return to Mr. Beast Burger,
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:21.260]   well, what is like, since we're on the topic,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.380]   what is a perfect day in the life,
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.700]   perfectly productive day in the life
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.620]   of Mr. Beast look like?
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.220]   - Oh boy, well, I mean.
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.060]   - Or like a standard.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:30.300]   - I mean, the perfectly productive day
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.140]   is we film a main channel video.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.900]   'Cause those get 100 million a pop.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:36.540]   I mean, it doesn't really get any better than that.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.940]   - What about like the average day
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.620]   when you're not on the set?
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.460]   - Yeah.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.300]   - And you're like, pull it.
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.940]   'Cause you're running a lot of things, right?
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:45.660]   - Yeah, so right now we have our snack brand Feastables,
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:47.340]   we have a restaurant chain Beast Burger,
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.100]   and then we basically,
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:51.380]   which we haven't even really launched any products yet,
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.900]   but we have the data company that I was showing you
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:56.020]   where we're gonna roll out some tools for creators.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.660]   And then we have the React channel,
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.780]   the gaming channel, the main channel,
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.060]   and then we have my charity, which also has a channel.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:05.900]   And so kind of how I've structured my life right now
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.220]   is whenever I have free time, we just kind of go,
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:13.620]   "Hey guys, Jimmy's got an hour from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m."
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.940]   And everyone's just like, "I need this, I need this."
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.500]   And this channel's like, "I need this thing filmed."
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.900]   Or whatever, the guy who runs my TikTok's like,
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.020]   "I need this TikTok filmed."
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.100]   Or Beast Burger's like, "I need this menu item approved.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.180]   Do we need to talk about this marketing thing?"
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:27.300]   And then we kind of just look at what everyone needs
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.300]   and we're like, "That one looks like the most important,
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.140]   we'll do that."
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.980]   And then, so it's just kind of like,
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.020]   if I just did that for every company in a day,
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.300]   then that's optimal.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.180]   So I just kind of, like an optimal day for me
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.540]   would be going down to eight companies
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.540]   and just whatever their two to three biggest pain points
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:44.460]   or things they need from me, and just doing those.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:47.020]   - Based on priority and then trying to keep it
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.060]   as short as possible to just the things
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:49.900]   that you're needed on.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.340]   - It doesn't get more optimal than that.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.380]   If I clear the bottlenecks, or some bottlenecks
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:57.820]   for all my companies, then it's, yeah, that's a perfect day.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.140]   - Yeah, I mean, even just me, 'cause you're like,
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:02.500]   you're showing me around and you're being a great
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.420]   and gracious host, but on top of that,
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.580]   you're just doing all these meetings.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.580]   You basically--
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:07.700]   - I felt bad at some points.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:09.220]   I was like, oh, I just tricked him
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.540]   into going to meetings with me.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.740]   He's like my little meeting buddy.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:13.860]   - Yeah, I mean, it was fun.
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.860]   It was fun to see how effectively you've delegated,
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:21.780]   you basically trust the team to do a really good job
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:24.540]   on the various things, and there's just a strong team
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:28.620]   that's able to carry the five on all the different tasks.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.380]   From the brainstorming and the main channel
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.980]   to the reacts and so on.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.020]   Yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.860]   I mean, it's really interesting what it takes
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:37.260]   to build a team like that, 'cause you very quickly
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:40.260]   build a very large team that's able to scale.
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:42.500]   - Which is very scary, 'cause it's my first,
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:47.140]   I'm 24, and I think I was telling you this earlier.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.140]   It's funny, 'cause six years ago,
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.860]   I had to raise my hand to go use the bathroom,
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.900]   and now I'm in charge of hundreds of people
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:54.140]   and entertain hundreds of millions of people.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.860]   And so it is crazy just how quick it comes up.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.620]   And I wish I was a little bit older
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.900]   so I could have ran a couple of companies
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.500]   and failed a few companies in the past
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.380]   and learned from those and applied those here.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.140]   'Cause I know for a fact, when I'm 34, I'm 24 now,
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.580]   when I'm 34, I'll know so much more
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.500]   about running a business and scaling and hiring
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.860]   and how to lead people and better effectively communicate
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:17.100]   and all these different skill sets
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.580]   that will make me a better leader,
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.260]   that that's the only thing that sucks,
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.900]   is I just don't have those,
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:24.820]   'cause I just haven't been through the lessons.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.380]   And I just have such a lucrative thing
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:29.060]   on my plate right now, and it just sucks
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:30.940]   that I have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:34.620]   - Yeah, 'cause you already have so much influence,
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.780]   so much impact, but you have effectively scaled.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.660]   What lessons do you draw from that,
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:42.420]   how to effectively scale as a 24-year-old?
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.540]   Like you-- - Yeah, that's something
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.740]   I feel like I actually could give a lot of value to
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:47.300]   to young people who are doing it.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.180]   Like older people who've built five companies
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.320]   or whatever they do.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.900]   I probably couldn't, they're gonna be like,
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:53.740]   oh, this is so obvious.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:58.740]   But for younger first-time business owners,
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:01.780]   you gotta just experiment, to be honest.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:04.460]   And for us, it's just a new space.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.060]   No one had really ever scaled up a 100-person team
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.060]   to make content on YouTube.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.540]   So there wasn't no, I spent all this time,
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.860]   like I hired one person from Disney at one point
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.060]   to come in and help.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:18.500]   And obviously that was a dumb idea looking back on it.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.940]   But I thought, oh, they make great stuff
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.660]   people wanna watch, and they come over here
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.980]   and help me build a team.
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:26.300]   And they build it more the traditional way
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.820]   and not like how it should be online.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:30.020]   And so then it's like, okay,
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.740]   and now I'm not trying to trash people.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:33.020]   Like they all tried their best.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.580]   But then I hired this one person
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:37.700]   who does this different type of media
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.020]   and runs a 100-person team.
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:41.500]   And then you come in here and they try to build it that way.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:42.940]   They don't really listen to you or value
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.060]   or see the difference.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:47.820]   And I tried basically for building this company
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.140]   with like four or five different people
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.140]   who worked in different veins of media.
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:55.180]   And every single time, it's just like,
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.020]   they just don't get it.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:58.100]   And they don't understand my world.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.540]   And the eventual solution was just like
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.140]   to roll up my sleeves and do it myself.
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.060]   You know, with like James or him, man,
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.340]   and just like, no one's ever done this.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:08.420]   And like, no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.500]   and tell us how to build this company.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:10.980]   We gotta figure it the fuck out ourselves.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.060]   - And you have to kind of build up people from scratch then.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:13.900]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.260]   All the stuff I was talking about earlier
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.900]   and all the lessons I learned along the way.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.460]   And so for me, that was a big part of like,
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.180]   stop trying to have someone build this company for me
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.460]   and just do it myself.
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.300]   'Cause it's scary.
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.900]   Like I spent my whole life studying YouTube videos
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.620]   and virality, not business building, but fuck it.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.700]   I was like, I guess we just gotta do it ourselves then.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.180]   And that's where things really start to click.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.580]   And we got the exponential growth.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.620]   We started getting the right people
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:38.860]   and training them the right way.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:41.140]   And, you know, just throwing conventional stuff
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:43.620]   out the door and focusing on what's actually practical
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:46.460]   for YouTube, which is just completely different
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.740]   than traditional media.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.700]   - So you train people and then those people train people
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.780]   and then so on.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.820]   - Yeah, I mean, it's just even like, you know,
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:58.220]   how you do the lighting on sets or like how you do the audio
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.100]   or, you know, not writing scripts.
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.820]   So, you know, we're just not as efficient with our filming.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.220]   Like sometimes I have to have 30 cameras running.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:07.460]   Why? Because it's not scripted.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:10.580]   I don't know what Chris is gonna do when we start filming.
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.500]   He might run over there, but guess what?
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.340]   We gotta have it planned 'cause there's only one shot.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.100]   I can't, you know, tell him not to do that.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.260]   - Yeah, that's the shooting,
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:18.700]   but then there's also the editing.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.860]   - Yeah, and then the editing as well
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.220]   and not having guardrails and kind of, you know,
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.740]   at the end of the day, it's whatever I want.
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.900]   The video, their job is to make a video
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:28.620]   that they think I'll like because it's my channel,
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.440]   but, you know, you can achieve that kind of however.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.940]   And so it's just, everything's just different.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:35.540]   You know, it's much more, I guess,
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.820]   like a startup as opposed to...
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.100]   - Are you often surprised like with the result?
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.660]   Like you think a certain, like we watched a video today
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.500]   that was really nice.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.300]   That was different than you would have potentially edited.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.140]   - Yeah.
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.260]   - Are you sometimes surprised by like a decision
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:51.080]   that it makes?
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.260]   It's like, okay, that's not the way I would have done it,
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:55.140]   but it's actually, this is a cool idea.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:55.980]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:59.220]   Yeah, the thing, my biggest fear is I don't ever want
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:01.900]   to get trapped in like a bubble of, you know,
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:03.660]   'cause we are getting a hundred million views a video
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:04.980]   on the main channel, like,
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.780]   but I don't want to get in this feedback loop of just,
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.580]   my ideas are great or, or I get that feedback loop,
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.340]   but stop learning and improving.
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:15.020]   'Cause it is easy sometimes to be like,
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:15.940]   what we're doing is working.
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.100]   We need to just keep doing it.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.500]   I want to keep learning and trying new things.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.460]   And I guess one way I'd put it is like,
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.580]   you don't, when you're on a come up
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.140]   or you're growing, you don't want to test new things
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:32.500]   once you start to plateau or have a downtrend,
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.260]   because if you're like, you know,
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.940]   you're skyrocketing, right?
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.620]   You're up, up, up, and then you level off
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:38.900]   and you start to go down and you're like,
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.980]   oh, this isn't working anymore.
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.060]   Let's start experimenting.
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.700]   Well, if you have a bad experiment,
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.140]   now you're in like a tailspin, you're nosediving.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:46.380]   And you have one more bad experiment,
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:48.740]   you're like, screwed, kind of, I'm oversimplifying.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:51.140]   You want to test things while you're still growing
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:53.180]   to keep the growing from happening.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.500]   Because once you like have, you know,
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.380]   again, very oversimplifying that like,
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:58.940]   you know, kind of level off,
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.620]   you do a couple of tests that go wrong.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.860]   In my view, you're like, screwed,
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:02.700]   you know what I mean?
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:03.540]   You're already out the door.
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.900]   Now you're just confirming that you're out the door
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.220]   and online entertainment.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:08.180]   So that's kind of how I see it.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.220]   So I think it's very imperative
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:10.740]   that you're constantly always experimenting
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.980]   and trying things, even if you're getting crazy,
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:14.620]   unheard of growth.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:17.580]   - And so that, outside of the thing
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.940]   that brought you to the dance,
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.460]   you just dived right into Mr. Beast Burger and Feastables.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:25.620]   This is a whole nother industry.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.700]   Like, what was that like?
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.060]   - Well, so Beast Burger, we kind of,
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:32.180]   it was supposed to be like just a pop-up.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.620]   Like we just partnered with someone
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:34.580]   who had 300 restaurants.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:36.300]   And we were just like, you know,
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:39.980]   let's just sell Beast Burgers for a day or two.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.020]   Let's see what happens.
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:43.900]   We didn't really think it would be as big as it was.
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.940]   But those first, like that first day,
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:47.940]   you know, we do six figures in sales
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:50.260]   and they all sell out and they're running to local Walmarts.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:51.780]   They can't keep up with the demand.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.100]   And it's like, okay, well,
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:56.500]   maybe let's just leave it open a week, whatever.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.780]   And we're just doing crazy revenue.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.020]   And it's like, okay, well, let's add some more restaurants
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.740]   and let's just leave them open for a month.
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:04.460]   And we're just still doing six figures a day.
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:07.540]   And it kind of just went from this thing that was,
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.100]   I don't know, it wasn't really,
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.340]   I didn't really plan on running a restaurant chain,
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:12.580]   but here I am.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.540]   - But didn't that, in some sense,
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.060]   also open your mind to something like Feastables?
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.700]   - Feastables is something I've always wanted to do.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:21.460]   'Cause I think just in general,
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:24.260]   American snacks are just full of so much
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.780]   horrible ingredients, to be honest.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.220]   And they're not, I don't know.
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.460]   I feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.400]   in American snacks in quite a while.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.260]   And so that's just something
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:35.620]   I've always been pretty passionate about.
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:37.140]   The thing, we built that from scratch.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:39.820]   So we hired the CEO and built a team around them.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:42.900]   And we spent probably over two and a half years
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.740]   before we even launched,
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.300]   just like building the right team,
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.780]   figuring things out and making sure
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:48.620]   it was actually ran the way I wanted,
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:51.860]   which Feastables has just been crushing.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.420]   It's very interesting.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:56.020]   This is something I've never talked about publicly,
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.180]   but having products in retail,
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:59.740]   it's like before Feastables,
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.460]   everything I had done was online.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.420]   So if you wanted to, you know,
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:05.340]   anything from the "Peace" brand,
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.340]   you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:09.620]   But Feastables, now that, you know,
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:11.740]   'cause our first product, chocolate bars,
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.020]   we started putting that in retail locations.
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:15.700]   So like, for example, Walmart,
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.500]   it's crazy.
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.940]   Like, it's just, it doesn't make sense how,
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.620]   if you're, which I guess it does for,
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:23.780]   'cause we get 100 million views a video.
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:24.700]   So a lot of people know us.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.940]   If I go stand in Walmart,
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:27.940]   those people recognize me and ask for photos.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:28.940]   Like if I stood there long enough,
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.060]   I could take 150 photos today in Walmart,
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.380]   or 200, whatever it is.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.860]   So obviously it makes sense those people go buy Feastables.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.820]   But then you just multiply that by every Walmart in America
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.620]   and it just gets so crazy.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.340]   And I didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.980]   And we're about to launch in some other,
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:46.540]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, so whatever,
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:50.140]   but other big retail locations and convenience stores.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:51.700]   And like by the end of next year,
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.740]   we could be in like 40, 50,000 locations.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:57.460]   And the numbers just don't make sense.
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:58.660]   - What are some interesting challenges
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.900]   about scaling there that surprised you?
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:02.780]   - The biggest problem, which I didn't think would be,
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.860]   was just keeping the shelves in Walmart stock,
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:06.700]   to be honest.
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.780]   - So that supply, the supply chain.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.620]   - It was brutal.
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:10.940]   Well, even then sometimes like, you know,
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:13.060]   you get them the stuff and they're like,
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.580]   it takes them like a day or two to put it out.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.420]   In that specific location.
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.740]   And I had to stop promoting it
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.180]   because every time I'd mention it,
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:24.300]   like 40% of people would just be like, it's not there.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.100]   It's not in Walmart or I can't buy it.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.340]   And so there was like a three-ish month period
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.540]   where I just didn't promote Feastables
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.740]   'cause I was scared that someone would go buy it
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:35.660]   and it's just not there.
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.540]   And so like, it took us a very long time
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:39.140]   to catch up to the demand.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:41.780]   And also, it's not like we have unlimited money.
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:46.260]   So, but now we're relatively caught up and keeping up,
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.140]   but it's gonna be interesting
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.100]   'cause now this year in 2023,
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:52.380]   we're gonna basically, you know,
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:54.340]   10X the amount of locations we're in.
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.820]   So we're, and we're gonna try to launch new products.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:52:01.300]   So we're in for an interesting ride, but yeah,
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.340]   I just hate, I hate when I tell people, you know,
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.500]   like, hey, go try this product.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.060]   And then they go in their local Walmart
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.540]   and eventually other places and it's not there.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.340]   It's just so brutal, you know,
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.780]   but they made that whole journey out there
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.620]   and they couldn't get it.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.380]   And so that was really it.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:18.500]   Besides that, no, it's been doing way better
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:19.500]   than I ever thought.
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:22.300]   - You've talked to a couple of places
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:24.860]   about maybe doing mobile games
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.860]   or computer games in the future.
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:28.620]   Is that something you're still considering?
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.500]   - Yes, because, you know,
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:32.620]   do you normally talk with people
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.460]   as much as we talked beforehand?
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.300]   Is that?
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.420]   - No, no, that was the problem.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:40.260]   We spent all day today talking about stuff.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:41.580]   In my head, everything you asked me
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.020]   is stuff we already talked about.
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:43.860]   - Not really.
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:44.780]   - Well, no, no, not everything.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.780]   I take it back, but sorry.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.420]   The last two questions, yes.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:49.980]   And so it's just funny 'cause--
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:50.820]   - What?
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:51.780]   No, I tried, so good.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:54.100]   There's a different style of asking those questions
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:57.380]   'cause I on purpose didn't dig further with you.
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:58.820]   - I could tell, yeah.
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:52:59.660]   I could tell you--
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:02.380]   - Okay, this is, by the way, okay, all right.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:06.340]   This is the first time I've ever talked to somebody
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:10.700]   as much as I did with you beforehand.
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.940]   - Yeah.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.140]   - On the same day.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.060]   - I know.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:14.900]   Not even the same day.
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:15.740]   - We spent all day together.
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:17.220]   And I only slept one hour.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.700]   - Yeah, literally, it's funny.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:23.780]   - This is a hilarious and awesome social experiment.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.180]   - I picked him up from his hotel
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.100]   and I just harassed him all day to hang out with me.
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:29.580]   And then here we are now.
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:30.420]   - I love it.
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.580]   I was secretly recording the whole time,
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.260]   just so you know, I'm just kidding.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.380]   Anyway, so what was the question?
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.860]   The mobile game.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.060]   - Yeah, so the interesting thing is
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:40.780]   with Beast Burger and Feastables
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.580]   that there's physical goods
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.380]   as opposed to making mobile games or PC game,
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:48.820]   whichever one we end up doing, which is software.
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.980]   And I actually have a giant international audience.
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.540]   Like most of my audience is obviously outside of America.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.100]   And so the problem we're running into
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:58.980]   is it just takes time to build up the supply chain
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.340]   and get Feastables in Southeast Asia,
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.860]   get Feastables in India, get Feastables in Brazil
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.420]   and Mexico and all these other places
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:07.860]   where we have giant pockets of our audience.
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:08.940]   And same thing with Beast Burger.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:11.260]   It's just, it's gonna take probably years
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.460]   unless we partner with someone
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.980]   who already has the distribution, which we're figuring out.
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:18.420]   But the beauty of software is I can make a hypothetical game
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.580]   or whatever we end up doing
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:24.580]   and all my fans can use it tomorrow, the day I mention it.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:27.460]   And so if I promote something in a video
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.740]   to a hundred million people and it's like a,
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:32.020]   basically like a game, they can all download it.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:36.300]   So, but if I promote a Feastables bar,
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.540]   right now it's only in America
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:38.900]   'cause we're struggling just to keep up
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:39.740]   with the American demand.
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:41.500]   We haven't even gotten the chance to go outside of America.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:44.740]   So I alienate a majority of my audience
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.140]   and it feels sort of shitty to just mention something
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:49.320]   that most of them can't buy.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.740]   But on the flip side, you can't just spawn
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.320]   this crazy infrastructure and just have tens of millions
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.780]   of bars and all your products in every single store
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:58.940]   across the world before you promote it.
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.740]   So you can't put the egg before the chicken.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:04.540]   And so it's like, that's what I'm excited about.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.860]   I wanna get into less physical stuff
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.580]   and more stuff that everyone in my audience
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.420]   can actually use.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.260]   This is the thought process.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.380]   - Especially if there's a social element to the gaming too.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:13.780]   'Cause it's not unlike Feastables,
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.300]   like that's a product you consume.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.140]   - You missed it.
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:18.940]   When you're setting up for this, we were doing some,
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.180]   basically just laying out everything
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.140]   that we're planning for.
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:24.440]   So we're at the phase where we wanna start hiring the team
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.700]   to build it and we're kind of just laying out the game.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:28.740]   And I was actually really curious to get your thoughts,
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:29.700]   but I can't say it.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:32.100]   'Cause whatever I say, someone's just gonna take it
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:32.940]   and run with it.
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:34.140]   But I have a pretty good idea.
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:35.980]   - About the kind of games you're thinking about?
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:37.100]   Yeah, I mean, I can imagine.
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:38.740]   We also talked a little bit about it.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.580]   It's super awesome.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:40.420]   - So much good ones.
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:41.240]   - I did.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:42.080]   - So much good talks.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.180]   I like the juicy talks to have on here.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.660]   She's like, I gotta go set up.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.140]   - Well, I already heard a lot of awesome stuff.
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:49.620]   I mean, but that is a different kind of team
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.820]   you would need to hire.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:51.660]   - Yeah.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.780]   - Is that a little nerve wracking,
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:57.060]   like going into a new field and trying to--
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.540]   - A little bit, but then I remind myself,
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:00.940]   like Steve Jobs didn't know how to code, right?
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:03.540]   And he just knew what a good product was.
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:05.940]   And I feel like as someone who wasted so much of his life
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.860]   playing video games, I have a good sense of it.
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.820]   And that might be ignorance.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.060]   - Well, that's really important, right?
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.060]   It's not about coding,
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:12.340]   it's about what makes for a good game.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.180]   - Exactly.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.700]   And again, that might genuinely be ignorance.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.980]   And maybe I end up getting bit in the butt
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.180]   because of what I'm saying now.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:21.100]   But I think just like with YouTube,
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:24.140]   I just wanna obsess over making a great product
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:25.980]   and things that I think my audience will love.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.780]   And I think as long as I keep that as my North Star,
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.620]   it'll do well.
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:33.220]   - What does the path to being worth 100 billion look like?
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.540]   - What does the path to being worth 100 billion look like?
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.380]   I don't know.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:37.980]   - Okay, let me just like pause here.
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:41.020]   24 and there's so much awesome scaling,
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.780]   so many great ideas.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:45.420]   Do you think about different trajectories?
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.420]   - Yeah.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:49.300]   - What those possible trajectories might look like?
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.780]   - Yeah, I mean, if the goal was
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:53.140]   to just be worth $100 billion, yes.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:56.580]   I mean, my goal, I'm a broken record,
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:57.700]   is to make the best video possible
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.540]   'cause I know whatever else I want will come, obviously.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.380]   - So the video is the foundation.
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:03.220]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:05.740]   So the path to $100 billion is keep getting
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:08.260]   100 million views a video, you know what I mean?
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.100]   - Or more.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.860]   - Yeah, or more, exactly, if we can keep growing.
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.420]   But if we can keep Feasible's growing, right?
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:17.260]   And we eventually expand international
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.820]   and one day we're in 100,000 retail locations
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.860]   and we're selling the same amount of SKUs,
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:24.660]   or units per SKUs like we're currently doing,
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.860]   I mean, that would crush.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.900]   And then obviously, ideally one day
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.540]   we open up hundreds of Beast Burgers,
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:31.180]   we get it where we turn out, you know,
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:32.860]   like Supercell, a couple hit games.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.940]   I don't wanna make dozens or hundreds of games.
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.260]   I just wanna make games that are just great.
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:38.460]   And, you know, we rarely drop 'em
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:40.740]   but we do, they're bangers.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:43.300]   And just, you know, whatever other stuff we end up doing,
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.860]   all that combined, I mean, it's just interesting
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:48.500]   because like what's a show that's pulled
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.860]   100 million views per episode, basically?
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.540]   - Like we're doing.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.540]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:54.660]   Like the Super Bowl gets praised
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.780]   'cause they get 100 million viewers
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:59.540]   but I can't think of a show, maybe in reruns or something.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:04.540]   - But it's also a show that has a singular kind of figure
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:06.220]   that you can now use as a--
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:07.940]   - Like I don't have a network tell me what to do.
[01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:09.900]   I don't have anyone, like I can do whatever I want.
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:11.940]   So it's a very interesting position
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:14.900]   'cause I put out content and 100 million people show up.
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.100]   And then I also have a gaming channel,
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.740]   I put out content and 15 million people show up.
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:18.980]   And I have a reaction channel, I put out content
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:20.180]   and 10 million people show up.
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:21.620]   I have a TikTok and I put out content
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.620]   and on average 20 million people show up.
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.980]   So as long as I can keep that going
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.300]   and then we build these businesses,
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.940]   it's like, it's honestly pretty scary
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.540]   to see what will happen over the years
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.860]   because Feastible's launched last year, 2022.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.220]   So it's a relatively new thing.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.660]   And Beast Burger, we just started scaling up
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.940]   the physical side and we haven't obviously
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:42.220]   even launched any mobile games yet.
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.500]   So I think I'm at the antithesis of it.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.900]   I don't see a world where my YouTube channels are relevant
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.940]   in the next couple of years.
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:49.460]   I just, this is what I live for.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.980]   And so if I can keep that going
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:53.060]   and then really start to expand these businesses
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:56.260]   that leverage off of it, then yeah, I mean,
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:57.940]   hopefully there's a day when I can give away
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:59.900]   a billion dollars in a video, honestly.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:03.700]   - Yeah, that would be one hell of a video.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:05.500]   Let me ask you the ridiculous question.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:09.460]   Since you went from being broke to being rich,
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.480]   although you keep spending all your money,
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:16.820]   does money buy happiness?
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.420]   How has money changed sort of your,
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:22.980]   your contentment, your happiness in life?
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.340]   - Does money buy happiness?
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:28.580]   No, not, I mean, to a point, yes.
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:30.880]   Once you can take care of your health,
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:33.540]   you can take care of like any immediate dangers
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:36.060]   and you can take care of your family relatively.
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:37.180]   No, it doesn't.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.020]   But those things do.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:39.340]   Like when I first came into money,
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.380]   one of the first things I did was retire my mom.
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:42.860]   And like that brought me tons of happiness.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:43.700]   You know what I mean?
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.380]   And like, you know, if my brother had a medical emergency
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:48.660]   and we couldn't afford it and I made money to afford it,
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.060]   that'd bring tons of happiness, you know?
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:51.820]   So once you take care of those basic necessities,
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.240]   so we'll say make over hypothetically a million dollars,
[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.740]   no, it really doesn't.
[01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:57.020]   Like adding an extra zero,
[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.500]   going from 10 million to a hundred million
[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.300]   or whatever it is, makes no difference.
[02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:03.380]   - So you're given that,
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:05.060]   or just fearless in spending the money?
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:06.380]   - Yeah, well, let me reframe.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.940]   I guess it could for some people,
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:10.280]   if you really, I don't know,
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.020]   you spent your whole life obsessing over cars,
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.420]   it probably would bring you a little bit of joy
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:14.540]   to buy a nice Lamborghini.
[02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.220]   I'm coming more from the frame of mind
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.460]   of an entrepreneur,
[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:19.180]   someone who's really obsessed with business building.
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:21.860]   For me and a lot of my friends and people I hang around,
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:24.900]   what brings us happiness is winning and building companies
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.260]   and changing the world.
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.940]   Like that is fun.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:30.740]   It's a complex problem you can wake up every day
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:32.380]   and it gives you something to obsess over
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:33.580]   and devote your life to.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:36.740]   Whereas just having money doesn't, you know?
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.420]   - Well, one interesting question
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:39.700]   I have for you psychologically.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:42.900]   So because you have become wealthy
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.020]   and because you give,
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:46.660]   like part of your work is giving away a lot of money,
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:50.300]   do you find it hard to find people you can trust?
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.180]   - Good question.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.620]   - Do people see you basically as a source of money,
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.620]   as opposed to another human being?
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.060]   - It's weird 'cause you would think yes,
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:01.820]   but I feel like I also know the right places to look.
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.260]   But yeah, if I just walked into Target
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:05.940]   and tried to make friends with 10 random people,
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.500]   of course, you gotta...
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.180]   - So you can kind of sense--
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.020]   - Oh yeah, you can sense--
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:12.840]   - Who has the right thing in their heart.
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:13.900]   - Exactly, right?
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:16.380]   That's, yeah, it's so obvious.
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.620]   So I don't even wanna go into descriptions,
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:23.300]   but honestly, a lot of my friends are like Chandler.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.220]   I played Little League with him.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:29.340]   And Tyler, the guy, I mean, I went to school with him.
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.140]   Chris, he was my first subscriber.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:34.180]   Carl was here after we got big, but whatever.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:35.340]   He's just friends with the boys.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.220]   And a lot of my closer friends,
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:42.100]   even like my YouTube friends, I knew before I was big.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:45.120]   So maybe there is some merit to that.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.360]   Maybe it is, I don't know.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:47.680]   I've never really put too much thought into it,
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.160]   but maybe there's a reason I hang around
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:50.640]   a lot of these people I knew before I got big
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.440]   because it's much easier.
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.580]   - And they help you keep your radar sharp
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:57.540]   of who can and can't be trusted
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:59.200]   'cause you know you can trust them.
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.040]   - Yeah. - And it's difficult
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.400]   when you become richer and richer and more powerful.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.400]   - Well, one thing you'll also find when you get rich,
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:07.000]   not even richer, but more famous.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.440]   One thing I thought is as I climbed this ladder of YouTube
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.300]   and got bigger, I thought there would be tons of people
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:16.020]   like me, people that take the kamikaze approach
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:16.860]   to building a business.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:17.980]   You just throw all your money in it,
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:19.540]   you throw all your time, you throw all your energy,
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:20.700]   you throw everything.
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:21.700]   You're just like, fuck it.
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.420]   It's this or I'm dead.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:25.900]   I thought there would be hundreds of me.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:26.980]   - And there isn't. - There isn't.
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:29.540]   I mean, there's maybe one or two.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.940]   And I talk to those motherfuckers every single day.
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:34.420]   I'm sick and tired of talking to them, but I love them.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:37.740]   But it's just so interesting 'cause every level I got up,
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:38.580]   I'd get a million subscribers.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:40.880]   All right, where's all these guys
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.840]   with a million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths?
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:44.760]   And then you don't, you know.
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.280]   - People become conservative as they get more.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.920]   - Especially as they get bigger, yeah.
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.880]   And 20 million subscribers, 30.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.560]   It's like every step of the way, it's like,
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.840]   I just got more and more lonely to be honest.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:00.640]   So it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.480]   in movies and you're like, oh, that's not how it works.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.600]   But it is.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.800]   There's just not many people that just wanna give up
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.940]   everything, go all in, and then obsess over making
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:10.780]   the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:12.660]   Like, they're really hard to find.
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:15.740]   - And be able to sacrifice everything for that video.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:18.820]   Like basically, you put all the money right back in.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.940]   - Yeah, or the people doing it,
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:21.240]   they're on just a small scale.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:24.060]   And if I talk to them, it's just 99.9% of the time
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:26.220]   I'm teaching them things and it's like.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:29.540]   - So it's lonely because there's not too many people,
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:32.100]   especially in the creative space, that are as crazy as you.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.540]   - Yeah, it is, 100%.
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:36.300]   It's so, it's not what I was expecting.
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:39.140]   I was expecting there'd be a lot of people like me.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.740]   - Well, I guess the guy we talked to, Elon Musk,
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:43.500]   is a bit like you in that sense.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.020]   - Yeah, just in a different domain.
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:46.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:48.300]   - Just willingness to put it all back in.
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:49.940]   - And that's why I've found right now,
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.320]   a lot of the people I relate to
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.820]   don't even make YouTube videos.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.300]   Like, I'm veering more and more away
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.660]   from fellow content creators and more to just,
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:00.280]   you know, I'm just looking for those other people
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.960]   who just share a little bit of it
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.340]   so I don't feel so fucking crazy all the time.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:05.580]   Like, you know what I mean?
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:07.580]   And like people I feel normal around,
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:09.420]   they tend to just be doing the randomest things,
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:11.060]   but you know, loving it.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.620]   - Well, I think that's really inspiring.
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:16.340]   It's like the Bukowski line,
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:17.940]   find what you love and let it kill you.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.980]   It's really put everything,
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.140]   put everything into the thing you love.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.220]   That's like the way to really create special stuff,
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:28.100]   but it's also the way to live out your life most fully.
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.920]   - You have to be careful giving this advice
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.660]   because they're like bodybuilders.
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:35.440]   So it'd be like, just go to the gym.
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:36.280]   Be disciplined.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:37.300]   I'm disciplined, go to the gym.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:40.220]   But I would argue for those people,
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.460]   it's like, it's not even discipline.
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:44.340]   They just enjoy weightlifting, right?
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:46.060]   'Cause there are people who are jacked,
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:48.380]   but they don't make much money or run a business, right?
[02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.660]   If they were that disciplined,
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:51.740]   they would be hitting every area of their life.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:52.660]   They just really like business.
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:54.340]   And then there's people like me
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:57.380]   who just to an extreme level love building companies, right?
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:58.580]   It's not even discipline for me.
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:04:59.700]   It's just in my blood.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.580]   It's what I wake up, I don't think about it.
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.420]   I don't push myself.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:04.060]   I don't need to watch a fucking motivational video
[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:05.220]   to go work.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.060]   I just do it.
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:07.800]   It's programmed in me at this point.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.920]   And I couldn't imagine a world
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:11.720]   where I don't wake up and do it every day.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:16.160]   But I think that a little bit of it is genetics
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.120]   and just how you're hardwired.
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.720]   Not that it can't be trained or taught.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.000]   And obviously the friend group you're in
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.600]   influences these things and over time,
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:24.620]   I think can change it.
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:27.520]   But someone's just not gonna be able to flip a switch
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:29.480]   and then just start doing a kamikaze approach
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.600]   to building a business.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.320]   Just like a lot of people try to flip a switch
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.200]   and start bodybuilding and then quit majority of the time.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.460]   It's just not innate to them.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.940]   - I think a lot of us have the capacity
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:40.660]   to do that in some domain.
[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:42.220]   - Yeah, I think if you went about it strategically.
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:45.220]   If you surrounded yourself with fellow like-minded people
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:48.140]   and slowly over time switched it.
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.820]   But if you just try to hardcore do it,
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.020]   you're just gonna lose your mind.
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.620]   - Do you ever worry about your mental health?
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:56.740]   Did you take a step to protect it?
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:59.900]   Yeah, for the long run,
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:02.100]   to make sure you have the mental strength to go on?
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:03.380]   - Yes, weirdly enough,
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:05.180]   the best thing for my mental health
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:08.900]   was giving into my innate nature to work.
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:11.580]   The most depressed I get is when I try to restrict it.
[02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:14.280]   And like, I don't work weekends or I don't work this day.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:16.820]   What's best for me is just to work when I feel like working
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:19.460]   and then just not work when I don't.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:20.780]   And just have no constraints.
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:22.980]   'Cause there are just some nights where I don't wanna sleep
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:25.780]   and for whatever reason, I feel compelled to go all night.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:27.580]   Whatever, just do it.
[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:32.040]   Do whatever you want is what I tell my working brain.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.300]   And I just give into it.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.060]   That's where I feel the happiest.
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.620]   And then it's typically like,
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:39.820]   when I'm really in the grind mode,
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.500]   it'll be like seven or eight days,
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:43.140]   just nonstop going, going.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:45.140]   And then it's like, I'll realize like,
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.140]   oh, I need some recharge time
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:49.900]   and then go fucking binge a season of anime.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.860]   Yeah, but that's the thing.
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.500]   People will tell you don't work weekends
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:55.100]   or don't do this or don't work past this
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:56.620]   or blah, blah, give you all these constraints.
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:00.180]   But for me, and it's unconventional, I just give into it.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:02.940]   - I think there's something really to be said for that.
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:05.860]   I try to surround myself with people that,
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.140]   like when I pull an all-nighter,
[02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:10.660]   they don't go like, you should get more sleep.
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.380]   There's a reason I pulled that all-nighter.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:13.980]   Like if I'm really passionate about something,
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:16.100]   they say, they basically encourage it.
[02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:20.200]   Because I have no problem getting sleep and getting rest.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:22.940]   What I need in my life is people that encourage you
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:24.100]   to kind of keep going,
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:26.220]   keep going with the stuff you're passionate about.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.860]   - Normal people, they don't want that life
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:28.860]   and they probably shouldn't.
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.580]   It's not good for you.
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:33.340]   But yeah, if you hang around people,
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.500]   just whatever, different people,
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.540]   you're gonna feel crazy and it's gonna wear on you.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:39.980]   Whereas if you're around similar people,
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:41.620]   it's so much easier.
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:46.380]   Like if you, I've started weightlifting more
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:48.260]   and one thing that's helped is just having
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.700]   jacked people around me.
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:51.380]   They naturally just eat healthier.
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:52.380]   They do.
[02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:54.620]   They naturally just have fricking grilled chicken
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:56.860]   and all this shit and high-protein meals.
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.740]   And it's just easier for me to just piggyback
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:07:59.900]   and be like, oh, can you just order me
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:01.260]   whatever you're getting?
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:02.660]   And they're like, oh, I gotta go to the gym.
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:04.780]   And I'll be like, oh shit, I'll just join you.
[02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:06.980]   And it's just, it's cheat codes.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:09.180]   Just surround yourself with people that you wanna be
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:11.620]   and it makes it like 70% easier, in my opinion.
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:14.460]   It's like, that is the cheat code to life.
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:17.340]   And I wish, obviously your audience is definitely
[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:19.860]   a lot older, but to the older people listening,
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:22.100]   like if you are in a place of mentorship
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.780]   for someone younger or have influence over younger people,
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:27.380]   you should really try to drill that in their heads.
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.100]   The people they are around 100% dictates the outcome.
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.300]   I would not be on 120 million subscribers
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:35.340]   if I didn't find, when I was around a million,
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:38.860]   I had a couple of friends that were just also psychopaths.
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:41.340]   I outgrew them, but at the time it was great.
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:44.420]   And I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for them.
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:48.180]   And just all along the way, the friends that I hung out with
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:50.980]   had such a dramatic impact on where I am.
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:54.500]   Like I'd probably have 80 million less subscribers
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:57.220]   if I wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.220]   that I add value to and they also add value to me.
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:02.380]   - So the advice for young people would be to
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:04.660]   be very selective about the people you surround yourself with.
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:06.580]   - So selective, it's crazy.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:11.220]   Like Chris, you know, he's really funny
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:12.620]   and that's why he's great for the videos.
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:14.420]   And part of why he's so funny is he consumes
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:17.300]   copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.340]   And so I'll find, like when I spend more time with Chris,
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.700]   I'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows.
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.780]   Like my speech will literally change
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:28.340]   just after like a week of spending more time with him.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:31.140]   It's like that quick of an effect.
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:33.300]   Now picture that over the course of years.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.620]   I mean, yeah, it has such a huge influence.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.380]   Like pluck one of their friends out
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:38.620]   and hypothetically put me in there.
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:41.300]   And there's no doubt if they're trying
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:42.540]   to become a content creator,
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.380]   their odds of success is 10X, right?
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.700]   Obviously you can't do that,
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.300]   but you gotta find your closest version of it.
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:50.020]   - And just be selective, yeah.
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:51.700]   But this also applies not just to younger,
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.020]   to older people too.
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.420]   - Agree, but it's even more,
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.580]   when I was a teenager, I just,
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:09:59.780]   I couldn't relate to many people.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:01.620]   I just thought I was like a fucking freaking nature
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:03.700]   because no one was obsessed with building businesses
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:04.980]   or any of this kind of stuff.
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:06.740]   And so like back then,
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:08.140]   that advice would have been helpful.
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:09.100]   Maybe not that particularly,
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:11.300]   but just knowing that there are,
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:12.660]   it's not that you're a freaking nature.
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:14.620]   You just haven't found people that have the same interests.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:17.180]   - So the task is not to feel sorry for yourself
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:18.180]   or somehow change yourself.
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.020]   It's more to find the people.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:21.380]   - Find people you fit in with, yeah.
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:24.260]   Assuming which, you're not getting compliments,
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:27.180]   assume it's not something bad.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:30.860]   If your hobby is shooting things,
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:32.740]   or shooting things you shouldn't be shooting,
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.660]   don't find people that encourage that.
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:37.940]   - But outside of that, for sure.
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:41.180]   Actually as an answer to what is the best advice
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.740]   someone ever gave you, you said,
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:44.580]   "You're crazy until you're successful,
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:45.780]   "then you're a genius."
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:47.820]   - 100%, all along the way.
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:49.440]   People who gave me so much,
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:53.480]   you know, advice on why I shouldn't be doing it,
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:54.560]   why I'm crazy.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:56.240]   Every step of the way, people wanted to tell me
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:58.240]   why I shouldn't be doing this and should get a life,
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.720]   should stop being too obsessed.
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:01.840]   Everything, everything under the book.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.840]   And then once I'm successful,
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.480]   those same people are like, "Dang, you're a genius.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:08.600]   "Wow, you really, you pulled that off."
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.600]   - Those are probably the same people
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.520]   that will give you advice now.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.280]   You're the most successful video creator of all time.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.280]   Stick to that.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.280]   Anytime you want to do something new, right?
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:24.280]   They'll pressure you not to do, you know,
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.000]   Feastables or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.680]   It's funny how people don't--
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:31.520]   - Well, honestly, they're the type of people
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:32.840]   I just don't talk to anymore.
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:33.840]   (laughs)
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.680]   I wouldn't even know what they have to say now.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.000]   - So most people on the team are like, "Yes, and."
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.200]   They're like, "Whatever the idea you got, they're with it."
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:42.560]   - No, I mean, it's weird.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.800]   We actually have a, my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.440]   which I want, I don't want yes men.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.400]   And they're like, they're, James, you know,
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.760]   the CEO who helped me build all this, he's very adamant.
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.320]   Like, we're not yes men.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:59.240]   And he trains people to really think for themselves.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.360]   And even when I give them orders,
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:02.060]   like really think like, is this optimal?
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:04.080]   Is there context or information Jimmy could be missing
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:05.280]   that I can provide that can help him
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.680]   make a more updated decision?
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.060]   Like, I'm not God, you know what I mean?
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:10.400]   Like I'm human and I make errors.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.880]   And so don't take what I say as the Bible.
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:15.880]   - So even like in the brainstorming and so on,
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.200]   they can push back.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.040]   - Yeah, you can see it.
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:19.240]   I'm like Tyler, anytime I said something,
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.680]   he would give me feedback and push back,
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.520]   which is what I want.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.340]   I don't want him just to be like,
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:24.880]   yes, you're a fucking genius, good job, Jimmy.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:27.600]   You know, I don't need that, you know, I need negatives.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.560]   - You talked about being in a relationship.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.200]   What role, Jimmy, does love play in the human condition?
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:41.120]   - I think, well, the big thing is that love can be scary
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.880]   'cause this is, you know, the human you're gonna spend
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:45.680]   the most amount of time with in your life, you know?
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.360]   And so for a project that over 50 years,
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.720]   they can be a liability or an asset.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:49.920]   - Love the metrics.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.400]   - You know, I love, no, but seriously,
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.440]   it's gotta be someone that makes you better.
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:54.640]   For me, I can't truly love someone
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.480]   that doesn't make me better because--
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:58.680]   - Yeah, in the long run, across the years.
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:00.880]   - Because if not, then it's like, it's a negative,
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.840]   you know, to everything I've spent my life building.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:06.640]   But luckily I'm very happy with the partner I have,
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.880]   like we were talking about before.
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:09.120]   I do think she makes me better.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.000]   There's a lot of actually positives I've noticed,
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000]   even things as simple as like, you know,
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.520]   I struggle to turn off my brain at night
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:16.440]   'cause I'm just thinking about all the businesses
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.840]   and how we could do better or whatever weird thing
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:19.680]   I have on my mind.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.040]   But, you know, just chatting with her
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.120]   and hanging out with her helps me like,
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.280]   basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out.
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:28.800]   And even like, there's just a ton of little things like that
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.400]   that I've noticed are positives,
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:31.760]   especially when you really look for them,
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:34.040]   that are easy to gloss over if you're not.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:37.640]   And so for me, yeah, I have someone
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:39.520]   who I think is very beautiful, very intelligent,
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.640]   makes me better, is constantly pushing me,
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.120]   okay with me working hard, makes me smarter,
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:45.660]   and just all these different things
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:50.040]   that I think for me, love just makes me a better person.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:50.880]   You know what I mean?
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.200]   Which makes me love her even more.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.400]   Does that make sense?
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.240]   - Absolutely.
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.040]   What advice would you give on finding somebody like that?
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.720]   - Just really don't give up until you find someone that,
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:05.480]   you know, there's so many people on the planet.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.640]   I mean, there really is.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.320]   There's billions of--
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:09.920]   - The odds are in your favor.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.800]   - Of, yeah, like just don't settle
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.800]   and find someone that, you know, makes you happy.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.900]   (sighs)
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:20.460]   Yeah, just like you said, surround yourself with people
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.260]   that make you a better person.
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.740]   In the same case, surround yourself
[02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:24.860]   with that one special person
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:27.140]   that really makes you a better person.
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:29.260]   - And maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain looking at it.
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:31.060]   Not everyone wants to hyper-optimize their life like me,
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:33.020]   but for me, to like truly love someone,
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:34.420]   they have to make me a better person.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:35.380]   - In every way, yeah.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.680]   - Yeah.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.140]   - Well, what do you hope, you're 24,
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:40.460]   we started talking about death,
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:42.540]   let's finish talking about death.
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:44.280]   What do you hope your legacy is?
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.900]   When you look 100 years from now,
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:49.700]   and the AI has completely taken over,
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:52.480]   and the aliens visit and discuss with the AI
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.660]   what this last of special humans
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.420]   that existed on Earth was like,
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.540]   what do you hope they say about you?
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:09.780]   - It's a deep one.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:13.100]   Probably just that,
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:15.500]   because it's hard, right?
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:18.540]   Like I said before, Elon is over double my age.
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:20.560]   I could live every second I've lived up
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.380]   to this point in my life and still not even be Elon's age.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.060]   So I have so much time.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:25.240]   I just hope whatever it is,
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:27.760]   that it's a net positive on the world,
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:32.760]   and it impacts billions of people in a positive way
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:35.940]   that makes lasting change.
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:38.860]   - So you admire people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:43.020]   for having sort of reached for that goal as well.
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:44.140]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:45.620]   - To help millions.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.340]   - I mean, the iPhone's the most successful product
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.180]   ever invented.
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:50.020]   It's hard not to admire what he created.
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:51.420]   You know what I mean?
[02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:54.140]   - The same with sort of, as Johnny Ive talks about,
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:58.860]   like the passion, the effort they put into the designing
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:01.180]   the iPhone, that like little bit of love
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.940]   is transferred to the whole world.
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.380]   Like they get to experience the joy of that
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.220]   from the designer.
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:07.260]   - It's what a beautiful thing to do.
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:09.400]   You know, I mean, I couldn't think of anything better,
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:11.420]   you know, to create something that,
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:12.960]   even after you're dead for decades,
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.860]   just has such a profound impact on basically
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:17.140]   half the human population.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:17.960]   - Yeah.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:18.800]   - It's wild.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.140]   - Brings joy to people.
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:20.980]   - Yeah.
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.060]   - Well, I hope you do just that, man.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:23.820]   You've already done it for millions and millions
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:25.060]   and millions and millions of people,
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.740]   and I hope you keep doing it.
[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:30.180]   I can't, like, it's so exciting to see what happens
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:31.740]   this year and next year.
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:32.580]   - I know.
[02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:33.420]   - Like, the sky's the limit.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.260]   - I'm excited too, yeah.
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:37.340]   - I can't, I mean, the videos,
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:39.180]   but all the other businesses you're in,
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:41.400]   and you as a human being as you grow,
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.420]   I can tell, I know, as everyone knows,
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:44.500]   you have a kind heart,
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:47.000]   and the fact that you're really damn good
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.080]   at actually using that kind heart to help a lot of people.
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:52.060]   It's awesome to see, man.
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:52.900]   - I appreciate it.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:54.260]   More importantly, before we go,
[02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:56.020]   are we gonna play Dune tonight?
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:56.860]   Some board games?
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:57.700]   - We're not gonna play Dune.
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.300]   I have to, I have like, one hour of sleep.
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:00.900]   - You don't wanna play board games with me?
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:02.220]   - I wanna, I'll play, I'll play.
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:03.060]   - You don't wanna play board games?
[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:03.900]   - I'll, this is--
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:06.100]   - You don't wanna play board games?
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:08.540]   - If only I wasn't an idiot,
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.740]   and actually flew to the right airport.
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:11.960]   - If you don't play board games with me,
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:13.360]   they're gonna dislike the video.
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.760]   (laughing)
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.360]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mr. Beast.
