[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Today's question comes to us from a "slightly confused sister in the Lord."
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.680]   "Hello Pastor John, I was wondering if you could help me think through two questions.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.040]   First, I have a deep burden and desire for missions as a calling.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.600]   This is true of me and brings me a lot of joy.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320]   However, it also brings confusion, especially in dating.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.280]   I feel guilty in fostering relationships with wonderful men who don't share my calling.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.560]   Would I be in sin if I married a godly man who didn't share my calling to missions?
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   Second, while I feel inspired to spread the gospel to unreached people, I don't feel
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.440]   called to minister in remote places.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.160]   I'm much more drawn to international cities.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.320]   I wonder if this helps alleviate the first question.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.820]   In APJ 1422, you said, "Marriage is not fundamentally the linking of arms in the pursuit
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.560]   of an agreed-upon vocation."
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.520]   You seem to have a less restrictive view on calling.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.080]   What thoughts can you offer to me as a woman who does not have the gift of singleness to
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.840]   think through missions and marriage?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.760]   Last night, as I was thinking about this question, I asked my wise wife if she had any thoughts
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.840]   about it.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.080]   I suppose it's because we've shared life for 52 years that the first thing that she
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.400]   said was the first thing that was coming to my mind as well.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.640]   She said, "I suppose it hangs a lot on the seriousness and confidence about her calling
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.040]   to missions."
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.720]   As our young friend had said, "I have a deep burden and desire for missions as a calling."
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   I think Noelle and I would say, "That's serious.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.200]   You're right about that."
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.160]   She also said, "I feel guilty in fostering relationships with wonderful men who don't
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.760]   share my calling."
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.440]   So Noelle's first thought and my first thought was that however our young friend conceives
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.080]   of her calling or however she arrived at a sense of this calling, we don't want her
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   to act against her conscience.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.240]   We don't want her to sense a deep burden and desire and even leading from God only
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.440]   to forsake that burden and desire and leading for the sake of a marriage relationship.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.040]   It's always dangerous to act against your conscience, even if your conscience is not
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.960]   infallible as a guide for God's will.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:05.640]   Now it's true that the Bible portrays marriage as a good and beautiful and even normative
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.360]   pattern for men and women in this world that God created.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:21.320]   The Bible begins at the very beginning of Genesis by creating, God creating, human beings
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.780]   as male and female and saying that it's not good for a man to be alone.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.480]   In other words, marriage is the normal way that God has planned for the human race to
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.600]   fill the earth for his glory and a man-woman relationship is the normal and good and beautiful
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.040]   way that God aims for the human soul to experience the kind of togetherness that we all long
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   for.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   But, and I put a big exclamation point after this, but, but with the fall of the world
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:10.320]   into sin and the disruption of the normal course of created life and the horrible lostness
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:19.380]   of the human race and the urgency of rescuing people from eternal destruction with the inbreaking
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.460]   of the age to come with Jesus Christ, an age which will have no marriage and no giving
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.480]   in marriage, Jesus said, with all of that, it would be wrong, be wrong for me to say
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:43.720]   that marriage is a mandate from God for all his children because the inbreaking, the breaking
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:55.120]   in of the kingdom may in fact call for a self-denial even of marriage and children for the sake
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.940]   of more pressing kingdom purposes.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.520]   This was certainly true for Jesus and it was true for Paul.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.920]   Neither of them married.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.840]   Paul blessed marriage, but he also exalted singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:22.640]   To all that to say that our friend who asked this question has more than one door open
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.260]   to her in the Bible.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.360]   Both doors, the one leading to the path of marriage for the glory of Christ and the other
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.320]   leading to the path of singleness for the glory of Christ are both biblically legitimate
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.840]   and can yield a beautiful and fruitful Christ-exalting life.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.040]   I think if I were having a personal face-to-face conversation with this young woman, I would
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.000]   want to take the approach that I have so often taken with people when they present me with
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.200]   either or dilemmas, both paths of which seem bad.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   I would want to say that God, precisely because he is God and not man, is never boxed in in
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.040]   the way we think we are between two options, both of which feel disappointing.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.880]   In her case, one option would be marry a man who doesn't share her mission passion and
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   be disappointed about her calling, and the other option would be stay true to your missionary
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.080]   calling and be disappointed that you forego marriage.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.560]   And I would want to say, don't think that way.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.320]   God is God, and there are more options than you know.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.480]   God may have a third way for you.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   And this is exactly the direction that Noelle's thoughts were taking when we talked last night.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.400]   Noelle has given a good deal of time thinking about single women missionaries and interacting
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   with young women.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.320]   She's written about these things in her book, Faithful Women and Their Extraordinary God,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.140]   and she reminded me of a story.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.760]   It was at one of our Desiring God national conferences, and at the end of one of the
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:25.640]   sessions, two single women who were pondering missions engaged Noelle in the hall outside
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.800]   where the session was about this very dilemma.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.440]   Should I wait to find a husband before I go to the mission field, or should I go and perhaps
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.200]   never find a husband?
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.760]   And Noelle pointed out to me now 20 years later that the young woman who went to Pakistan
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.200]   as a single woman found her husband there, which seemed absolutely crazy, impossible.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.360]   That's not going to happen in Pakistan.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.520]   And the woman who stayed is still single.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.440]   And I'm not saying, "Oh, don't hear me say that the woman who stayed was disobedient."
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.920]   That is not the case at all.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.520]   She's living a productive, Christ-exalting life right now.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:19.480]   But I smiled when I heard that story that Noelle recounted, because the way I was going
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:29.040]   to put it is this, the best place to find a like-minded husband or wife is precisely
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.080]   on the path of your missionary calling.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080]   That's the best place.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:42.160]   In other words, the third possibility is to follow your sense of God's leading toward
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:50.480]   missions with a patient trust that if you indeed don't have the gift of singleness,
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   if you would dishonor God by singleness, God will lead you to a like-minded spouse, even
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.920]   when you think it looks absolutely impossible.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.080]   Last December at the Cross Conference, the missionary conference for 18 to 25-year-olds,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.960]   one of the panel participants who leads a pretty rigorous missionary preparation ministry
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:23.200]   said in all seriousness, standing on the platform with David Platt, that—he was not joking—"Many
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.240]   of the single men and women who come to our training find their spouses there."
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:37.640]   Now it's easy to joke about that and to joke, say, about Christian colleges being matchmaking
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.880]   institutions.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:48.520]   Well, how fitting and beautiful and appropriate and wonderful is it that the place a person
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.560]   finds a like-minded husband or wife is precisely on the path where you're doing what you
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.760]   believe God called you to do, for goodness sakes.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   That may be getting a solid Christ-centered education in a college, for living a God-centered
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   life.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:11.280]   That may be a place to find a spouse, or it may be missionary training or a missionary
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.120]   life in a place where you think, "There's no way I'm going to find a spouse out there.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.080]   Pakistan, for goodness sakes."
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   Look, he's God.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.400]   He's God.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:32.360]   It's just like God to bless his mission-minded followers with the desires of their heart.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.160]   God knows what we need.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.160]   God is good.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   God is wise.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.960]   God is sovereign.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.000]   God is able to do what seems impossible for man to do.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.720]   So I return to my wife's first thought.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:56.640]   How serious and how deep and how confident is this sense of calling in this young woman?
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:06.520]   Because if it is serious and deep, then probably she should set her face, her heart, to pursue
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:15.320]   it, and trust God that on that path she will find her greatest joy and do the world the
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.200]   greatest good and bring Christ the greatest honor.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   Wonderful.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And thank you, Noel, for pointing out those stories as well.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.080]   We appreciate her wisdom here on the podcast.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.160]   And thank you for listening.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.440]   As we see in this episode today, many topics we address on this podcast provoke new questions
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.040]   that also need to be asked and answered.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.720]   And if you have a follow-up question, get those questions to us at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.280]   You'll see a button for submitting a question, which opens up a new email.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.680]   And we appreciate it a lot, all of the emails that come to us.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.120]   I know we get to answer so few of them, but we appreciate all of them.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.880]   Well, in our fight against sin, do we focus our attention on Christ, or do we focus our
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   attention on ourselves?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.120]   Who do we focus on?
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.240]   It's a very tangible question from a listener.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   And it's the next question on the docket for Monday.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.280]   Thank you for listening to the podcast, and have a wonderful weekend.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.780]   [END]
