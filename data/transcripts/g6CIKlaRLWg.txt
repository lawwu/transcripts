[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Pastor John, how did the influence of C.S. Lewis prepare you to discover the
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.920]   theology of Jonathan Edwards? Here's the connection, at least the best I've been
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.360]   able to figure out what God was doing, not just between '64 and '68, the Wheaton
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.120]   years, but '68 to '71, the Fuller years. I see the Lewis, Clyde Kilby, my lit
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.160]   professor, Wheaton connection, that cluster of influences as putting the
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.880]   intellectual and aesthetic kindling in place, and it was a very big pile. I mean
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.400]   these were dry and unbelievably flammable sticks that were being put in
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.480]   place, the sticks of logic and the sticks of aesthetic awareness, the sticks of
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.600]   longing and aching and yearning, the sticks of awareness of beauty and the
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   desire to see it, know it, all those sticks were being put in place so that
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.920]   when the fire of Reformed theology, namely Dan Fuller, the Puritans, fell in
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.760]   the years '68 to '71, they had sticks ready to burn. That's the way I understand
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.560]   what God was doing. I didn't get the content so much of my theology at Wheaton
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.800]   as I did the categories of thinking and the categories of feeling and the
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   intensification of a soul engagement with the world, so that when I began to
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:54.720]   read God's book, the Bible, having schooled myself on God's book, the world,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.880]   everything in it just exploded. All the ways that Lewis had spoken about
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.400]   seeing things for what they really are, feeling them for what they really are,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   speaking them in words that awaken the true value of them, all of that came to
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.360]   bear on my reading of The End for Which God Created the World by Edwards or the
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   Religious Affections by Edwards or The Freedom of the Will by Edwards. I felt no
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.040]   conflict between what I had become under C.S. Lewis. Theologically, I think there
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   are conflicts. At least we're going to explore that. Doug Wilson doesn't think
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.720]   there are conflicts between Lewis and Reformed theology, and I'm
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.480]   real eager to hear how he works that out, but what I had met in the
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   Problem of Pain by C.S. Lewis and what I met in The Freedom of the Will didn't
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.680]   sound the same to me, and I would be happy to be shown how they're coherent.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.480]   But yes, I think Lewis was a remarkable preparation and guide and help in
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.200]   many ways in preparing me for Jonathan Edwards. Thank you, Pastor John. We will
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.700]   be studying the enduring influence of C.S. Lewis later this fall on September
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.520]   27, 28, and 29 here in Minneapolis at the Desiring God National Conference. The
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.200]   conference is titled "The Romantic Rationalist--God, Life, and Imagination in
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680]   the Work of C.S. Lewis." More details and registration will be available soon at
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.040]   DesiringGod.org on the blog and under the Events tab. I'm your host Tony
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.120]   Rehnke, thanks for listening.
