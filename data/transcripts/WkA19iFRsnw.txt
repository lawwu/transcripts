[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.260]   - Well, how do we respond when God feels distant from us?
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.760]   Several versions of that question have come in recently
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080]   from listeners on the topic of spiritual desertion.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.340]   I can boil them down to three categories basically.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.100]   First, spiritual desertion is an experience
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.120]   of God hiding his face from the believer.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.240]   But in the great text on contentment
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.840]   and how we live free from the love of money,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.520]   we are given a glorious promise,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.960]   one we have repeated several times on APJ.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.600]   We should cultivate material contentment in this life
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.040]   because God has promised us,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.320]   quote, "I will never leave you nor forsake you,"
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.240]   end quote, that's Hebrews 13 five.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.720]   So how does desertion relate to this promise
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080]   that we will never be forsaken?
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.280]   Secondly, does the Bible tell us why God deserts believers?
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.020]   Should we read into the experience of desertion
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.680]   as something we have failed to do or need yet to do?
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.480]   And what has his absence felt like to you,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.040]   Pastor John, personally?
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.360]   And then third, in the famous desertion psalm of Psalm 22,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560]   we read that God does not hear the psalmist's prayers
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.960]   and refuses to deliver him from his distress,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080]   hence the felt desertion.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.920]   And yet the psalmist still delights in God in verse eight.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520]   So what does it look like to delight in God
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.720]   in felt desertion?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.580]   So Pastor John, there's a mix of questions for you
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.740]   all under this label, this umbrella of spiritual desertion.
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700]   - Well, just a word of caution to start.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700]   The term spiritual desertion doesn't occur in the Bible,
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.020]   nor does the word desertion itself,
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.820]   at least not in the ESV.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.820]   So we have to be careful that when non-biblical words
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.140]   or terms are used to describe biblical realities,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.140]   we don't force any connotations of those non-biblical words
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.980]   onto the biblical reality.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.580]   I think what's being asked in all of these concerns
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.460]   is not only about the objective circumstances
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.580]   that can be so painful in the lives of Christians
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.900]   that it looks objectively like God
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.940]   is just no longer working for us,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.620]   but probably more what's being asked
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.380]   is about the subjective inner sense
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.800]   when we don't feel the presence of God
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.340]   and we don't see the glory of God
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.000]   and we don't sense the sweetness of his fellowship.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.780]   Whether he's near or far,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.600]   the question I think is mainly about subjectively,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280]   he feels far, it's true that a Christian
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580]   can have the experience of desertion
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.800]   in both of these senses.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.980]   The objective, it just looks like he's gone.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340]   He doesn't do anything for me anymore.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.580]   And the subjective, whether he's near or far,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.060]   I don't feel, I don't taste, I don't sense.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.160]   I think that's the main concern.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240]   So I won't linger long over the first sense
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.020]   because that's not the focus of these questions,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.060]   I don't think, and I've spoken about it so often.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.300]   I'll only say that Paul deals
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.700]   with the objective afflictions of Christians
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.720]   in Romans 8, 35 to 38,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   and amazingly, he does so by quoting the Psalms.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.460]   He quotes Psalm 42, 22 to 24, which says,
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.780]   "We have not forgotten your name, O Lord.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.080]   "We have not spread out our hands to a foreign God,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.700]   "yet for your sake we are being killed all day long.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.480]   "We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.160]   "Why do you hide your face?"
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   And Paul explains that God's face is hidden
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.440]   only in the sense that outward,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.800]   physical blessings are being withheld.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.680]   But he protests strongly that in every loss
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.660]   and affliction for the Christian,
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.440]   we are more than conquerors.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.580]   So Paul's answer to the outward,
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.140]   objective appearance of desertion
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.140]   is that God is present, he's here,
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.820]   and he's working through our troubles.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.860]   And in that very teaching, Paul paradoxically shows
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.620]   that if we really understood what God was doing,
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.420]   we would know it was to help us see him more clearly,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.020]   not less.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.780]   There's this beautiful poem called "The Thorn"
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.300]   by Martha Nicholson, who died in 1953,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.760]   that ends like this.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.600]   He never gives a thorn without this added grace.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.780]   He takes the thorn to pin aside the veil,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.400]   which hides his face.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.380]   So Paul's answer to this first kind of objective desertion
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.540]   is that we need to learn the biblical truth
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.540]   that the thorns of life, which we think are God's desertion,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.620]   are in fact designed to pin back the veil of worldliness
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.260]   that hides God's loving face.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.720]   That's a huge change in your mindset,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   but crucial in order to understand
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.380]   how to respond to what appears to be objective absence
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.140]   of God, but isn't.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.060]   But the main thing, I think, being asked in these questions
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.100]   is about the inner sense of the Christian
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.220]   when we don't feel the presence of God
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.240]   and we don't see or savor the glory of God,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.180]   and we don't sense the sweetness of his fellowship.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.640]   So let me give several texts from the New Testament
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   that provide biblical categories that are Christian,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.400]   Christian categories for this experience,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.640]   the experience of more or less of this darkness,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.360]   as if the Lord were absent because you don't see
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   or savor his beauty or feel his fellowship.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   So number one, 1 Corinthians 13, 12.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.720]   Now I know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.480]   even as I have been fully known.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.400]   In other words, some measure of hiddenness
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.740]   is what we have to live with now,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.600]   no matter how we live until Jesus comes.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   Second, Ephesians 5, 19, be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.720]   meaning that there are different measures
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.800]   of experience of the Holy Spirit's fullness.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   And what does the Holy Spirit do
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.800]   but reveal the beauties of Christ
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   and thus stir us up to joy and boldness?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.880]   So there's more or less clarity
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.280]   of spiritual seeing and savoring,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.480]   depending on what degree of fullness we are enjoying.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.880]   Third, Ephesians 4, 30, Paul says,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.040]   do not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.000]   And in 1 Thessalonians 5, 19, he says,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.440]   do not quench the Spirit.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.200]   So there are sinful attitudes and behaviors
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   which do indeed grieve and quench the Spirit
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   and thus draw a veil between us and the beauty of Christ,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.820]   which the Spirit gives.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.960]   Fourth, Paul prays in Ephesians 1, 18,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   that the eyes of your hearts would be enlightened
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   so that you may know your calling,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.800]   your inheritance, and the power of Christ in you.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.640]   In other words, the eyes of our hearts
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   see with greater or lesser clarity the glories of Christ.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.320]   And finally, 2 Corinthians 4, 6,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   Paul says that God shines in our hearts
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.120]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.860]   in the face of Christ.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.060]   That's the glory we long to see
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   with steady, unveiled brightness.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.300]   But all of these texts imply
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.780]   that the Christian life is variable.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.780]   It is a fight to the end.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.820]   Paul says, I have fought the good fight
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.880]   just before he dies.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.020]   I've fought the good fight, finished my course.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.500]   And it's mainly a fight to see.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.120]   It's a fight to see and savor the beauty of Christ
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.000]   right to the end.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.440]   One of the questions that you read
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.780]   asks me personally what the absence of God
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.300]   has felt like to me.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.940]   And I would answer like this.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.120]   God has given me the grace
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.420]   not to think in terms of God's absence,
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.160]   but only of my dullness, my disobedience.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.720]   In other words, I believe that Jesus Christ,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.360]   as my Savior, is always near.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.200]   First, because he is omnipresent.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.140]   He upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.600]   But second, because he promised,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.200]   I will be with you always, always, to the end of the age.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.860]   Matthew 28, 20.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.540]   And third, because he has put his spirit within me
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.540]   as the down payment of my final redemption,
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.380]   and the spirit does not come and go.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.440]   Ephesians 1, 14.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.360]   Therefore, my experience is not of God's absence,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   but of my absence, my dullness, my faithlessness,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.300]   my disobedience.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   I don't fight to get God's objective presence.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.860]   It's there.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.860]   I fight to get his manifest presence, experienced presence.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.960]   That's my experience of his reality,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.400]   which really means that the key changes
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.880]   have to happen in me, not him.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.680]   His location is not the issue.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.420]   My faith, my sanctification is the issue,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.080]   and that's the battle of my life every day.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.560]   So finally, the last question is,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.160]   what does it look like to delight in God
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.120]   in felt desertion?
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.600]   It's a huge question, so let me just point to a passage
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.200]   for you to think about.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.720]   Hebrews 12, 2 says, "Look to Jesus,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.520]   "who for the joy that was set before him
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.040]   "endured the cross."
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   So Jesus experienced a profound sense of desertion
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.640]   on the cross as he cried out,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.040]   And this text in Hebrews says,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.680]   "He was able to endure that
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.160]   "by the joy that was set before him."
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   Now, I think that means that the faith of Jesus
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.400]   in his father was able to hold on,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.440]   was able to taste by memory or by hope
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   some incremental measure of the anticipated joy with God.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   I think that's what it looks like for us as well.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.840]   For God's elect, for his adopted children,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   God will hold us fast, like the song says.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.600]   And the way he holds us is by preserving
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   that mustard seed of remembered or anticipated joy
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.080]   at the father's right hand.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.560]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for covering so much ground

[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.380]   Well, are non-Christian marriages,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.040]   the marriages of two non-Christians,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.400]   is that union legit in God's eyes?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.280]   Why or why not?
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.840]   It's a great question.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.000]   It's up next on the other side of The Weekend.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
