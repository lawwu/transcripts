[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.700]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.720]   Dr. Matthew Johnson.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.800]   Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.940]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.160]   where he also directs the Center for Psychedelic
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.280]   and Consciousness Research.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   As many of you know,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   there's extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.980]   for the treatment of various disorders of the mind.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.000]   Dr. Johnson's laboratory is among the premier laboratories
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.240]   in the world understanding how these compounds work,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.280]   how things like psilocybin and LSD and related compounds
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.800]   allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and change
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.600]   such that people can combat diseases like depression
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.960]   or trauma or other disorders of the mind
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   that cause tremendous suffering.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.120]   Dr. Johnson is also an expert in understanding
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   how different types of drugs impact
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.040]   different types of human behaviors,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.600]   such as sexual behavior, risk-taking, and crime.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.960]   Dr. Johnson and his work
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.000]   have also been featured prominently in the popular press,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.080]   such as articles in the New York Times
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200]   and Michael Pollan's book, "How to Change Your Mind,"
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.960]   and in a feature in "60 Minutes" about psychedelics
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080]   and the new emerging science of psychedelic therapies
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.400]   for treating mental disorders.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.520]   During the course of today's conversation,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.280]   Dr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800]   at the level of what's called microdosing,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   whether or not it is useful for the treatment
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.480]   of any mental disorders.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.960]   We also talk about more typical macrodosing,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.720]   what those macrodoses entail,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.000]   and he walks us through what an experiment
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600]   of a patient taking psychedelics
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.460]   for the treatment of depression looks like
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.040]   in his laboratory from start to finish.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.740]   The conversation was an absolutely fascinating one
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.120]   for me to partake in.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.800]   I learned so much about the past, present, and future
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.160]   of psychedelic treatments and compounds.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.400]   And indeed, I hope to have Dr. Johnson on this podcast again
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840]   in the not too distant future
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.160]   so that we can talk about other compounds
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.280]   that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.660]   and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.520]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.780]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.200]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.160]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.240]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.000]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.400]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.800]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.720]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.480]   once or twice a day, every day,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.800]   is because it covers my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.760]   It has the vitamins I need, the minerals I need,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.920]   and the probiotics are important to me
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.120]   because there is now so much data
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   about the importance of the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.000]   maintaining healthy gut bacteria,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   and the ways in which those gut bacteria
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.800]   impact things like inflammation
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.460]   and keeping inflammation down in the brain and body,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.800]   as well as supporting things like quality mood,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.520]   endocrine function, metabolic function,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.960]   just so many factors.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.600]   The great thing about Athletic Greens
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.960]   is that it also tastes very good.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.840]   I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.360]   and as I mentioned, I drink that once or twice a day.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.760]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.800]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.100]   and if you do that, you'll get the Athletic Greens,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.720]   plus you'll get five free travel packs.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.080]   The travel packs make it very easy
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.160]   to mix up Athletic Greens when you're on the road,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040]   in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.640]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.080]   There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D3 and K2
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.000]   are important for various aspects of metabolic health,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.640]   cardiac health, and so forth.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.060]   So once again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.740]   to get Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.880]   and your year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.380]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.840]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.400]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.260]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.360]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   and now with the advent of quality DNA tests,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.280]   you can get a lot of information about your genetics
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.700]   and how that also impacts your immediate
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.100]   and long-term health.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.320]   The reason I'm such a fan of getting blood work done
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.800]   is that it is really the only way to understand
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.960]   what's going on in your system at a level
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.820]   that can really inform your decisions
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.420]   about your immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.120]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.380]   is that you get numbers back about your hormones
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.940]   and your metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.080]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.420]   With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy-to-use dashboard
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.800]   that gives you that information
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.400]   and then gives you some suggestions and directives
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.700]   about things you could change about your nutrition,
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.880]   about your exercise, and other lifestyle factors
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.320]   that can help you move those numbers in the direction
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.640]   that's best for you and for your health.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.100]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.360]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.160]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.760]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.840]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.500]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.400]   that raises organic, grass-fed,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.120]   and finished certified humane meats.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.760]   I eat meat about once a day.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.280]   In general, my lunch or my breakfast
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.880]   consists of some meat,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.640]   and that meat has to be of very high quality,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.600]   and generally, I'll eat some vegetable as well.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.660]   And then I tend to eat pastas and rice
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.240]   and things of that sort later in the day or in the evening
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.720]   in order to facilitate the transition to sleep.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.800]   So I'm eating meat about once a day,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.320]   and I always insist that the meat that I eat
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.840]   be of the very highest quality
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.260]   and that the animals were raised and maintained humanely.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.680]   While conventionally raised animals
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.840]   are confined to feed lots
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.960]   and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.280]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   and seasonal grasses,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.000]   and healthy fats.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.480]   In addition, they raise their animals
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.560]   in a way that's not just better for our health,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.340]   but also has a positive impact on the environment.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.000]   They practice regenerative agriculture,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.100]   which means the meat is climate positive
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.320]   and carbon negative,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.880]   so you can feel good about what you're eating
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.960]   at the environmental level and for sake of your health.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   You can order Belcampo's sustainably raised meats
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600]   to be delivered to you by using my code Huberman
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.100]   at belcampo.com/huberman
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.060]   and entering my code Huberman to get 20% off
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.760]   your first time order.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   I'm partial to the ribeyes or the New York steaks,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.060]   so on one day I might have a ribeye,
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.540]   the next day I might have a New York steak.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.220]   I also really like the meatballs,
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.160]   so I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.500]   So again, that's belcampo.com/huberman
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.760]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.120]   to get 20% off your order.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.580]   And now my conversation with Dr. Matthew Johnson.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.100]   Well, Matthew, I've been looking forward to this
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.980]   for a long time.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.420]   I'm a huge fan of your scientific work
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.680]   and I'm eager to learn from you.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.600]   - Likewise, big fan and happy to do this with you.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.340]   - Great, well, thank you.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.280]   My first question is a very basic one,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.080]   which is what is a psychedelic?
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.440]   We hear this term all the time,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.880]   but what qualifies a substance as a psychedelic?
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.220]   - Nomenclature is a real challenge
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.760]   in this area of psychedelics.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.780]   So starting with the word psychedelic,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.020]   it just, if you're a pharmacologist,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.900]   it's not very satisfying because that term
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.460]   really spans different pharmacological classes.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.920]   In other words, if you're really concerned
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.100]   about receptor effects and the basic effects of a compound,
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.660]   it spans several classes of compounds.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.100]   But overall, so it's really more of a cultural term
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   or it does have a relationship to drug effects,
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.900]   but it's at a very high level.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.020]   So all of the so-called psychedelics
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.020]   across these distinct classes that I can talk more about,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.500]   the way I put it is they all had the ability
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   to profoundly alter one's sense of reality.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.060]   And that can mean many things.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.660]   Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.560]   acutely, so when someone's on the psychedelic.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   So the different classes that can be,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.640]   the specific pharmacological classes
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   that can be called a psychedelic
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   are one, what are called the classic psychedelics.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.080]   So in the literature, you'll see that term.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.960]   And hallucinogen and psychedelic
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.640]   are all have traditionally been used synonymously.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.320]   I think there was a little of a tendency
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.380]   to stay away from psychedelics as the baggage,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.820]   but there's been a return to that in the last several years.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.440]   But the classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.180]   are things like LSD, psilocybin,
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.140]   which is in so-called magic mushrooms,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.920]   it's in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.780]   dimethyltryptamine or DMT,
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.060]   which is in dozens and dozens of plants,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.980]   mescaline, which is in the peyote cacti
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.700]   and some other cacti like San Pedro.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.460]   And even amongst these classic psychedelics,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.880]   there are two structural classes.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.840]   So that's the chemistry.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.960]   There's the tryptamine-based compounds
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.160]   like psilocybin and DMT,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.240]   and then there's the phenethylamine-based compounds.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.040]   So these are the basic two to basically building blocks
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.280]   that you're starting from,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.980]   either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.640]   But that's just the chemistry.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.240]   All of the, what's more important,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.980]   or at least to someone like me, are the receptor effects.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.040]   And then ultimately that's going to have a relationship
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.980]   to the behavioral and subjective effects.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.460]   So all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonists
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.100]   or partial agonists at the serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.860]   so subtype of serotonin receptor.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.500]   Then you have these other classes of compounds
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.660]   that you could call psychedelic.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.240]   Another big one would be the NMDA antagonist.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.460]   So this would include ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan,
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.900]   something I've done some research with,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.720]   which folks might recognize from like robo-tripping,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.740]   guzzling, like, you know, call syrup,
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.840]   which is something kind of like high school kids
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.040]   are known to do when they can't get ahold of real drugs,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.360]   that type of thing.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   So a large overlap in the types of subjective effects
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.560]   that you get from those compounds
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.080]   compared to the 2A agonist classic psychedelics.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.480]   But then you have, and by the way, this description,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.880]   this framework I'm describing,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.300]   not everyone will agree.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.340]   Some people will say,
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.000]   "No, psychedelic only means classic psychedelic."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.500]   So there's different opinions here,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.820]   but you have, gosh, salvinorin A,
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.300]   which is a kappa opioid agonist, which again-
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.580]   - Where does that come from?
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.980]   - Salvia divinorum.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.140]   It's a plant that became 20 years ago.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.060]   It sort of popped onto the legal high scene.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.500]   And there's a long history of this.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.560]   Predating the internet,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.340]   going back to like the stuff one could order
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.720]   in the back of High Times Magazine.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.620]   And most of this stuff like never worked.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.820]   You know, it's like the smoke enough of anything,
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.580]   maybe you get a little bit lightheaded.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.140]   But this is one of those things that popped around
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.860]   20 years ago when it quickly got the reputation of like,
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.120]   holy shit, this stuff actually works
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.260]   and works really strongly.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.380]   In these smoked extracts particularly,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.480]   people have these reality altering experiences
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.380]   on par with smoked DMT, the classic psychedelic.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.740]   So often, and we did the first
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.260]   blinded controlled human research with salvinorin A.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.000]   So lots of entity contact.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   So feeling that you, in the experience of one
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.440]   is actually interacting with autonomous beings,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.940]   that type of thing.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.800]   And then you have another big one,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.500]   probably should have mentioned even before the salvinorin A,
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.780]   but you have MDMA,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.860]   which really stands in a class by itself.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.240]   So it's been called an intactogen and-
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.760]   - What does that mean?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.820]   - It means like touching within.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.860]   It sort of eludes the idea that it can really put someone
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.440]   in touch with their emotions.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.500]   It's also been called an empathogen,
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.440]   meaning it can afford empathy.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.240]   But I think intactogen is probably,
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.220]   that's the term that I tend to focus on.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.760]   And I know I'm not telling you anything you don't know,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.500]   but for the viewers,
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.920]   the primary mechanism of MDMA is serotonin release.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.040]   And to a degree, other monoamine release,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.760]   dopamine, serotonin.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   And so structurally that's also in the phenethylamine class,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.120]   which contains mescaline, the classic psychedelic,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.640]   but also amphetamine.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   So just like Adderall is in that phenethylamine class.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.520]   And so this is another example
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.040]   where chemistry doesn't dictate.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.920]   I mean, you can tweak a molecule,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   it might have that same basic structure,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.800]   but now you've profoundly changed the way it interacts
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.640]   with the receptor.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   So MDMA does not exert its actions
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.520]   by, I like to say, by mimicking the baseball,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.060]   entering the postsynaptic receptor side,
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.480]   acting as an agonist.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   So mimicking the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.200]   like the classic psychedelics do,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.360]   MDMA works on the pitcher side
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.400]   of just basically throwing out
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.560]   more of the natural, the endogenous.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.400]   - Dumping more serotonin.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.920]   - Dumping more serotonin, flooding the synapse.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.500]   - So I get the impression that the psychedelic space
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.480]   is a enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.300]   - Right.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.680]   - Meaning some are impacting the serotonin system
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.920]   more than the dopamine system.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.180]   Others are impacting the dopamine system
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.840]   more than the serotonin system.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.120]   - Given that the definition of a psychedelic
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.180]   is that it profoundly alters sense of self,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.160]   at least that's included as a partial definition,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.500]   can we break that down into a couple of subcategories?
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.860]   So for instance, hallucinating, either auditory or visual,
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.840]   synesthesia, perceptual blending,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   the sense that you can hear colors and see sounds,
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.780]   for instance, a common report of people that take psychedelics
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.480]   in sufficiently high doses.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.880]   So hallucinating, synesthesia,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.080]   and then in terms of sense of self,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.200]   you know, as a neuroscientist, I think, okay,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.800]   what does it mean to alter a sense of reality?
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.920]   Really what the brain does in a very coarse way
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.040]   is to try and figure out what's happening in space,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.120]   physical space, and that physical space
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.520]   could be within us or outside us,
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.740]   and what's happening in time, right?
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.100]   And as a vision scientist, the simplest explanation
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.180]   is when I move my hand from one location to another location,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.820]   it's measuring the space,
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.260]   the location of my hand in space over time,
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.220]   and then you get a rate and a speed
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.440]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.880]   - Yeah.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.800]   - That gets more complicated
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.860]   as you get into the emotional realm.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.620]   But is it fair to say that psychedelics are impacting
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.980]   the space time analysis that the brain is performing
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.620]   and thereby creating hallucinations
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.620]   and thereby altering, you know, the blending of senses?
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.320]   Is it fair to say that?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.140]   - I think it's fair to explore that area.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.740]   And here's what I'm thinking.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.600]   Clearly there is a changed relationship,
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.780]   certainly at the right dose, of orientation in space time.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.100]   I think as a, you know, I'm primarily a behaviorist,
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.380]   and in terms of human behavioral pharmacology,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.940]   I always go to comparative pharmacology, okay?
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.220]   What can we say that is it truly unique
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.420]   about the classic psychedelic, or psychedelics in general?
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.260]   So with that description, I'm thinking, okay,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.160]   alcohol can really screw up your, you know,
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.260]   time-space orientation.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.100]   - And proprioception, your balance.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.860]   - Proprioception. - Your vestibular, yeah.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.100]   - You know, and in many ways,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.980]   and sort of in those gross motorways, like far worse,
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.600]   you know, of course everything's dose dependent,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.200]   but in the classic psychedelics, you know,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.660]   obviously the benzodiazepines being very similar alcohol,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.500]   same thing.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.880]   So, you know, I'd want to, you know,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.140]   dig in a little more in terms of like,
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.380]   maybe there's something more specific we could say
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.580]   about that relationship to time and space
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.740]   that the psychedelics are tinkering with.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.660]   But I'm not sure.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.760]   It's an interesting hypothesis that the idea
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.020]   that that's a mediator, that that's something,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.360]   that there's something fundamental about changing that,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.000]   the representation in time and space.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.220]   There might be something to that.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.740]   I mean, I think of these as psychedelics
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.720]   as profoundly altering models, you know.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.780]   We're all, you know, we're prediction machines
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.620]   and that's large, so much of that is top-down
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.620]   and psychedelics have a good way of, you know,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.540]   loosely speaking, dissolving those models.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.340]   And one of, at the reality-
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.520]   - Can you give us an example of one of, like a model,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.780]   like I know that when I throw a ball in the air,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.220]   it falls down, not up.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.980]   That's a prediction that I learned as a child
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.400]   that I did not come into the world with a brain
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   that knew that relationship between objects and gravity.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.260]   But one of the first things that a child learns
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.380]   is the relationship between objects and gravity
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.340]   and their trajectories.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.980]   - Yeah, and with a four-year-old,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.180]   I mean, I saw that at earlier ages,
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.140]   like that experimentation of like,
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.420]   oh yeah, that's what happens, you know.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.620]   - Right, so if he were to throw a ball,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.180]   if your child were to throw a ball
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.020]   and it went up into the sky,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.220]   that would be absolutely mind-blowing.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.460]   It would be for an adult too.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.100]   - It'd be a pretty psychedelic experience probably.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.400]   - Right, and so there's a rule there, you're saying,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.340]   there's a kind of a prediction,
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.940]   there's a rule that underlies a prediction
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.180]   that when that rule is violated,
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.340]   all of a sudden the circuit,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.420]   presumably for that prediction,
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.020]   like it doesn't have a mind of its own,
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.420]   but somehow it creates a surprise element
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.780]   or a recognition element.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.020]   - And it's not filtered out, you know.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   And this might sound extreme, but there are these cases,
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.700]   it was overblown in sort of the propaganda
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.460]   of the late '60s, early '70s,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.460]   but there are credible cases of people,
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.180]   and it's very atypical of,
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.460]   sounds like they really thought they could fly
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.140]   and jump out of a window.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.100]   Now, far more people every year fall,
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.380]   I mean, who knows, they fall and die from height
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.060]   because they're drunk, so this is extremely rare.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.260]   But there are some pretty convincing cases.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.060]   There was one research volunteer in our studies
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.060]   that she looked like she was, in one of our studies,
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   like she was trying to dive through a painting on the wall.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.100]   She was fine, but she, reviewing the video,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.420]   it looked like she really thought
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.980]   that she was going to go through that painting
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.260]   and who knows, into the other dimension.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.660]   - Yeah, so they're violating these predictions.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.860]   Yeah, the reason I ask it, the question the way I did,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.460]   is because given the enormous cloud of different substances
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.500]   and given the range of previous experiences
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.380]   that people show up to a psychedelic experience with,
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.340]   I feel like the ability to extract some universal themes
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.900]   is useful, especially for people
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.620]   who haven't done them before, right?
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.580]   Who might not have an understanding
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.500]   of what their effects are like.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   Can we just briefly touch on the serotonin system
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.980]   and the dopamine system?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.900]   I want to acknowledge that, as you already know,
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.460]   that there are many neuromodulator systems in the body
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.860]   and the opioid systems, cannabinoid systems,
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.340]   but there's something so profound
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.740]   about the serotonin system and the dopamine system
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.300]   because the way I define a neuromodulator
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.920]   is it's a modulator, it changes the way
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.660]   that other circuits behave.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.480]   And essentially it increases the probability
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.840]   that certain circuits will be active
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.900]   and decreases the probability
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.480]   that other circuits will be active in a general sense.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.560]   So compounds like LSD,
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.380]   lysergic acid, diethylamide, and psilocybin,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.440]   my understanding is that they primarily target
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   the serotonin system.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.440]   How do they do that at a kind of general level?
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.240]   And why would increasing the activity
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.100]   of a particular serotonin receptor
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.120]   or batch of serotonin receptors
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.360]   lead to these profoundly different experiences
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.600]   that we're calling model challenges,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.020]   challenging pre-existing models and predictions?
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.560]   I mean, at the end of the day, it's a chemical
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.800]   and these receptors are scattered around the brain
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.100]   with billions of other receptors.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.180]   What do we think is going on in a general sense?
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.480]   - Yeah, yeah, and this is really the area
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.680]   of active exploration and we don't have great answers.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.380]   We know a good amount about the receptor level pharmacology.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.820]   Some things about post receptor signaling pathways.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.540]   In other words, just fitting into the receptor.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.300]   Clearly, serotonin itself is not psychedelic
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.340]   or else we'd be tripping all of us all the time.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.960]   - 'Cause when I eat a bagel, I get serotonin release, right?
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.800]   - Uh-huh.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.180]   - I mean, there's turkey, I mean, there's tryptophan, right?
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.040]   My understanding of serotonin is that in very broad strokes,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.000]   that it generally leads to a state of being fairly,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.160]   it pushes the mind and body towards a state
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.560]   of contentment within the immediate experience.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.000]   Whereas the dopamine system really places us
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.280]   into an external view of what's out there in the world
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   and what's possible.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.120]   - Yeah.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.240]   - Is that fair to say? - Need to do something.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.540]   I mean, that's consistent with my understanding
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.480]   and I'll certainly not, in terms of,
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   I don't primarily identify as a neuroscientist.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.920]   Definitely tell the viewers that we're far more
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.720]   in your domain here than mine, but in terms
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.960]   of how psychedelics and other drugs, you know,
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.360]   interface at the neuroscience level.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   - Well, feel free to explain it at the experiential level.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.200]   - Yeah.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.400]   - I mean, it doesn't have, I think,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.000]   there probably are some audience members
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.860]   that are interested in, is it the 5-H2C?
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.140]   Is it the layer five neurons and cortex?
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.520]   That conversation we could hold
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.800]   and that's an interesting conversation,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.000]   but just in terms of the experience of serotonergic
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.640]   versus dopaminergic drugs.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.480]   - Yeah.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.360]   - They do seem to create distinct classes of experience.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.040]   So I think that's the appropriate level
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.160]   for us to discuss them.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.520]   - And in terms of how they, and I'd like to explore
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.600]   the biology a little bit here and tell you, like,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.240]   sort of what's known and what some of the ideas are.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.420]   - Please.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.820]   - You know, have this path, you know, as you know,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.020]   like, you know, these are levels of analysis
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.120]   and it's not which one is going on.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.240]   It's almost like, for the particular question,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.760]   which level of analysis is most appropriate?
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.120]   Is it, you know, is a question best addressed
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.400]   by the biology, the chemistry or the physics?
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.160]   That's how I think of like receptor level,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.600]   post receptor signaling, downstream effects
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.440]   and other neurotransmitters,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.880]   and then activation level effects
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.760]   and then coordination of activation.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.380]   So you got the, clearly with the classic psychedelics,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.320]   the 2A activation, we do know that there are downstream
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   effects in terms of increasing glutamate transmission.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.600]   So this is likely a commonality why, you know,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.320]   ketamine is very psychedelic in a slightly different way.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.960]   - Do people hallucinate on ketamine?
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   And it's more dissociative, so someone is more likely
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.160]   to sort of be less behaviorally active.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.260]   If they have a really high dose, they go into a K hole.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.700]   And if they go in a really high dose,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.080]   like you get into surgery, you're just unconscious.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.720]   - Not an A hole, but a K hole.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.180]   - A K hole, yeah, it's very different.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.340]   The K hole, and ketamine is interesting
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.820]   because people can take kind of bumps
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.940]   and kind of dance on it with the sort of an alcohol level
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   strength of effect, and that's sort of the classic
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.900]   kind of raving use of it.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.780]   But then those folks want to titrate their dose
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.140]   because if they do more of like a line,
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.620]   you get up to like 75, 100 milligrams,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.140]   then you're talking about, you know,
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.680]   if you're on the dance floor, you're on the floor
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.380]   and your friends are trying to make sure
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.560]   people aren't stepping on you.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.400]   So that's like-
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.300]   - Yeah, why would somebody want to take
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.400]   a dissociative anesthetic?
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.940]   Like to me, it's completely mysterious
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.540]   as to why someone would want to dissociate from their body.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   - People claim that these NMDA antagonist psychedelics
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.740]   are extremely insightful in a very similar way
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.220]   to the experiences with the classic psychedelics, so-
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.300]   - And ketamine is now legal for therapeutic use.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   - Right, right, Spravato, the intranasal form,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.580]   marketed by Janssen, which is esketamine-
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.940]   - It's prescription.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.460]   - Yeah, it's prescription and-
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.740]   - So people are taking in the nasal spray?
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.580]   - Yeah.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.220]   - And then are they undergoing talk therapy
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.100]   while they're doing this?
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.820]   - Typically not, so this is very interesting
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.560]   and there's so much work that needs to be done.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.300]   It's not treated as psychedelic therapy.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.180]   And by that psychedelic therapy, I mean,
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.460]   you tell the person they're going to have
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.140]   an altered experience.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.500]   You tell them to pay attention to that experience,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.320]   that they might learn something from that experience.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.740]   And afterwards you discuss that experience.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.940]   With Spravato, the model is-
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.860]   - Spravato is?
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.940]   - Is esketamine.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.780]   - Okay.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.440]   - It's the, yeah, the spray form of ketamine.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.920]   It's been FDA approved for treatment-resistant depression,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.580]   but you'll probably feel different, ignore that.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.020]   That's a side effect.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.420]   That's an adverse effect.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.940]   Just ignore it.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.880]   We don't think that has anything to do with the way it works
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.180]   but just get this thing.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.080]   It's a direct sort of chemotherapeutic effect in a sense.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.320]   It's not facilitating a learning process.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.020]   Now there's older work.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.100]   There was a guy Kripitsky in Russia
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.040]   that did extensive work with higher doses of ketamine.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.020]   I should say Spravato at the prescribed doses
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.620]   isn't very, it's a pretty low dose.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.660]   It's in the mild psychedelic range, but it's not very strong.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.220]   But this older work that happened in the '90s
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.060]   and early 2000s in Russia,
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.360]   they were using very high doses
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.340]   and treating it like a psychedelic,
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.220]   treating it as if it was a psychedelic therapy.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.580]   In other words, telling people,
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.800]   you're going to have this experience.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.080]   It's going to, we're hoping you learn something from it.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.940]   We're going to help you through it.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.380]   We're going to discuss it afterwards.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.840]   And they found incredibly high rates of success
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.420]   in some pretty well-controlled trials
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.860]   for both heroin addiction and alcohol addiction.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.620]   So I think a whole lot of work needs to be done now.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.320]   And you see some of the ketamine clinics
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.900]   that are using ketamine off-label,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.940]   a lot of them are treating it like psychedelic therapy.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.700]   There's essentially no research at this point on that.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.060]   Do you get better results?
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.420]   Straight-abusive Spravato, there's some good variability,
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.940]   but its antidepressant effects last about a week.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.500]   But they kick in immediately.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.900]   Now, a week is a long time for like most psychiatric drugs.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.900]   Like you take it every day.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.020]   So that's amazing, but it's still just a week.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.620]   We're seeing effects a year or more later
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.460]   with psilocybin and some of the classic psychedelics.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.460]   That could be a pharmacological difference,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.140]   or it could be that they get a lot more mileage
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.340]   out of ketamine if they treated it like psychedelic therapy.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.180]   And so that's some-
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.000]   - What would that look like?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.380]   - Really just like our psilocybin sessions,
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.900]   which I know I haven't described,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.940]   but briefly you have anywhere from four to eight hours
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.940]   of preparation, getting to know the people
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.740]   who are going to be the guides or the therapists
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.580]   in the room with the person.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.420]   - Yeah, maybe you could walk us through this.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.460]   So let's say I were to come to one of your clinical trials,
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.900]   'cause these are clinical trials, right?
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.080]   And in your lab at Hopkins.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.920]   And would I need to be depressed
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.220]   or could I just be somebody who wanted
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.740]   to explore psychedelics?
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.860]   - We've had studies for all of these
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.260]   and a number of other disorders.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.900]   So healthy normal studies,
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.980]   the code for not a problem to fix, but we're all here.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.260]   That's what's amazing about psychedelics though,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.340]   because if you administer them under this model
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.600]   and you develop a relationship
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.140]   and give a high dose of psychedelic,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.700]   you can be a healthy normal without a diagnosable issue,
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.640]   but man, we're all human
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.100]   and the issues seem to come to the surface.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.180]   So, but we've done work with smoking cessation.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.800]   So people trying to quit tobacco
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.640]   and haven't been successful.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.260]   - So a variety of reasons.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.060]   So maybe I'll just ask some very simple questions
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.600]   that would kind of step us through the process.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.100]   So let's say I were to sign up for one of these trials
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.220]   and I qualified for one of these trials.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.040]   I'd show up, you said I would do several hours in advance
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.100]   of getting to know the team that would be present
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.140]   during this psychedelic journey.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.180]   - First there's screening.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.580]   So it's kind of like a couple of days of both psychiatric,
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.620]   like structured psychiatric interviews about your whole,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.720]   your past and symptoms across the DSM,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.040]   the psychiatric Bible to see if you might have
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.380]   various disorders that could disqualify you.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.900]   Like the main ones being the psychotic disorders,
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.300]   schizophrenia, and also including bipolar.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.780]   So the manic side of bipolar.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.580]   So after that, and also cardiovascular screening,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.140]   heart disease, after that screening,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.500]   then the preparation where you get, you're both,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.100]   you develop a therapeutic rapport
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.260]   with the people who are going to be in the room with you,
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.580]   your guides, but you're also then didactically
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.460]   sort of explained about what the psychedelic could be like.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.180]   And that's kind of a laundry list
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.740]   because they're more known by their variability than,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.220]   it's not like cocaine.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.340]   Like you're going to feel stimulated.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.820]   You're going to feel like, you can do any, it's like,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.300]   or alcohol, you're probably going to feel more relaxed.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.060]   It's like, I call them uppers, downers, and all arounders,
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.780]   and the psychedelics are all arounders.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.800]   It's like, yeah, you could be,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.660]   you could have the most beautiful experience of your life
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.800]   or the most terrifying experience of your life.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.700]   So it's just kind of laundry list of like the things
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.600]   that could happen, so there's no surprises.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.260]   - I think it's so important for people to hear
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.900]   because the all-arounders, they,
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.500]   you really can't predict how somebody
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.660]   is going to react internally.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.620]   I want to just briefly touch on something
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.480]   because we left that topic, but it occurred to me
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.380]   that a lot of these effects of psychedelics
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.040]   and how they function, et cetera, is still very mysterious.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.140]   But then I recall to mind that how most prescription
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.880]   antidepressants work is also very mysterious.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.140]   They increase serotonin or dopamine or epinephrine, et cetera,
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.100]   but why they take weeks on end, you know,
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.740]   several weeks to kick in, et cetera, is also mysterious.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.860]   But going back to the experience
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.460]   of coming to your laboratory, okay,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.940]   so let's say that somebody passes all the prerequisites
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.820]   and it's the day.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.420]   It comes the day that they're going to have this experience.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.780]   Are they eating mushrooms like you hear about,
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.140]   or are they taking it in capsule form?
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.460]   And what sorts of doses are you prescribing?
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.060]   Is there a dose-response curve?
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.460]   And then secondary to that,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.280]   I'd like to talk about microdose versus macrodose.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.100]   So how do they get this stuff into,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.720]   how do people receive it
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.900]   and how do they get it into their body?
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.220]   - So they receive pure psilocybin.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.240]   So the mushroom, and there are many species,
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.140]   the most, if people have taken mushrooms
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.700]   in the United States, it's most likely psilocybe cubensis.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.600]   They're easy to grow.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.880]   They grow in cow patties.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.740]   It's easy for anybody to grow them in their closet.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.580]   It doesn't take a 1,000-watt light like cannabis.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.600]   It takes like a little, you know,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   10-watt light bulb and a Tupperware bin.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.300]   So those are the types of mushrooms
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.240]   that people typically take.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.900]   We're not administering those.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.340]   Psilocybin is the compound.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.900]   You could draw a molecule, psilocybin,
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.080]   again, based on the tryptamine structure.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.720]   Like that's a single molecular entity.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.040]   So it's a white powder.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.440]   - Does it look like serotonin molecularly?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.040]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.800]   - So if I were to show people the chemical structure
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.140]   of serotonin and the chemical structure of psilocybin,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.560]   it would look quite similar.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   - Right, right.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.600]   - So they're basically taking serotonin.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.840]   - A modified version of serotonin, which makes sense.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.660]   But then again, this repeated theme of the chemistry
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.380]   doesn't always neatly line up
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.360]   because like mescaline looks more like dopamine
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.780]   than it does like serotonin,
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.980]   but yet at the receptor activation level,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.160]   the pharmacological effect, those are similar.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.360]   But yeah, I mean, and what it does at the receptor
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.000]   is an alternate, it's hitting the same switch,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   but then having an alternate response at the receptor level.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.680]   - Yeah, so for people that don't necessarily understand
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.640]   the relationship between what we call ligand,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.400]   the thing that parks in the receptor
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.240]   and the receptor is the parking spot,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.920]   one of the reasons that you can get such a variety of effects
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.860]   from different compounds is, for instance,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.460]   serotonin might affect a certain pathway
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.460]   at a particular rate and psilocybin might trigger activation
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.560]   of different components of that pathway at different rates.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.320]   And so you can get vastly different experiences
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.660]   from two things that look chemically similar.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.260]   This is also a good reason why people
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.660]   shouldn't just assume that they can
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.820]   cowboy their own chemistry, right?
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.440]   That what you see on paper and what you can mix up
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.260]   in a vial is often vastly different than what you predict.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.480]   - Right, and there's a dose effect curve
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.660]   that's really interesting.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.380]   Some of our early work with psilocybin in healthy normals
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.980]   looked at a true placebo plus four active doses,
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.320]   five, 10, 20, and 30 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.520]   Body weight adjusted, so, you know, those milligrams
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.840]   per 70 kilograms of body weight.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.540]   We've recently published a paper in our newer trials
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.680]   where we're dropping the body weight adjustment
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.100]   'cause our going across hundreds of volunteers,
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.440]   we've kind of figured out that you shouldn't really be,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.040]   you don't need to be adjusting by body weight.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.740]   - Interesting. - So, yeah.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.920]   - Well, brain size doesn't vary that much
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.240]   between individuals.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.000]   - And, you know, at the end, this is a brain effect, mostly.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.880]   - Probably body as well.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.320]   Okay, so the person ingests the powder or capsule?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.440]   - In a little pill. - Okay.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.220]   - Yeah, and it doesn't take 30 milligrams as a small,
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.920]   you could fit it into a tiny little capsule.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.160]   And it'll take about a half hour,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.400]   but anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to kick in.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.380]   - And you said the dose range was?
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.560]   - Most of our studies are looking at
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.760]   where we want a psychedelic effect
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.740]   are in the 20 to 30 milligram range.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.200]   Again, because we have adjusted by body weight
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   and the average American is over 70 kilograms,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.400]   about 150 pounds.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.880]   Like people, and in fact, have gotten more like 40, 45
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.680]   in a lot of cases, but it's still a small pill.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.640]   The session day itself is not full of,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.840]   for most of our studies, is not full of tasks.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.560]   We really want to look at the therapeutic response.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.440]   Obviously, if it's a therapeutic study,
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.640]   we want it to be a meaningful experience
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.420]   and research has found, not surprisingly,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.500]   that you get a less meaningful experience
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.880]   when you're in an FMRI
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.180]   or when you're doing a lot of cognitive tasks.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:57.280]   We've done some research of that type, for sure,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.080]   and plenty of colleagues have,
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.740]   but when you're in a therapeutic study
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.840]   or if you're trying to understand the therapeutic effects,
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.960]   you have to recognize there's this trade-off
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.800]   of what you can do.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.560]   So our typical therapeutic model,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.900]   which again, isn't just limited necessarily
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.120]   to the therapeutic studies
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.480]   where we're trying to treat a specific disorder,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.940]   is to have that preparation
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.720]   so the person feels very comfortable with their guides.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.680]   I mean, ultimately, what I tell people is like,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.200]   any emotional response, it's all welcome.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.060]   I mean, you could be crying like a baby hysterically,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.560]   like that's what you should be doing
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.720]   if that's what you feel like.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.940]   And so, in a lot of ways,
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.920]   sometimes people with psychedelic experience on their own,
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.040]   it can be harder to train them in this model
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.880]   because in the real world,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.160]   people with psychedelic experience,
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.940]   a lot of times the rule is, you know, hold your shit.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.720]   So several friends go to a party,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.100]   they split a bag of mushrooms.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.520]   It's like, you know, there's a social pressure
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.520]   for good reason not to be the guy in the corner of the room
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.900]   where everyone's trying to just have a good time and relax,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.580]   like crying about your mother.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.080]   Your other friends are, they're having an experience too,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.600]   and you're being a drama king and blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.160]   And so like, yeah, compose yourself, hold your-
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.600]   - You're doing, I mean, you're doing therapy for people.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.160]   This is, it's not just about the experience.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.920]   - Right, and the experience itself is very much shaped
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.340]   by that container, by the environment,
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.280]   and the degree to which one allows it to happen.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.240]   Like, one should let go of control.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.140]   - Yeah, let's talk about the letting go of control.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.440]   And then as we march through this hypothetical experience,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.780]   that does take place in your lab,
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.320]   but we're using a sort of generic case example, if you will.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.060]   The letting go of control is an interesting feature actually,
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.760]   because one of the common themes of good psychoanalysis
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.060]   or psychotherapy of any kind is that there's a trust built
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.660]   between the patient and the analyst,
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.620]   and that relationship becomes a template
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.760]   for trust more generally and trust in oneself.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.700]   It's actually, the end goal of good psychoanalysis
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.080]   is that the patient actually, one of the end goals
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.380]   is that they develop an empathy for themselves,
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.240]   which almost sounds like an oxymoron,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.400]   but if you spend a little time with that statement,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.120]   it actually pans out.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   So the psychedelic experience is one in which chemically,
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.840]   you're under a new set of conditions, right?
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.960]   Let's coarsely, space and time are altered in some way,
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.000]   sense of self, for instance,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.180]   I might be going to a strongly interoceptive mode
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.620]   where I'm focusing on everything
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.920]   within the confines of my skin,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.320]   whereas normally we're sort of interacting in space
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.920]   and pens and conversation.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.440]   And I'm sort of, if I had,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.040]   occasionally I'll pay attention to my breathing,
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   but I'm sort of dilating and contracting my focus
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.320]   for different things all the time.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.660]   The letting go of control, it seems to me,
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.520]   could be sort of the expansion of one perceptual bubble
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.240]   to the point where you're not actually worried
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.600]   that that perceptual bubble is going to pop or that,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.960]   meaning you're not worried about what people think of you.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.640]   You're not worried whether or not your brain
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.520]   is going to explode,
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.680]   even though a thought could feel enormous.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.920]   If I keep going like this, it almost sounds psychedelic,
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.040]   but that's the idea here.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.760]   Or if I'm paying attention, for instance,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.680]   to some somatic experience,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.600]   like the coursing of waves of heat through my body,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.520]   that I'm not suddenly saying, is that weird?
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.800]   I'm actually just going deeper and deeper into it.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.720]   So it's essentially expanding our perceptual phenomenon.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.440]   How do you convince people
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.680]   to go further and further down that path?
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.220]   What do you think allows them to do that?
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.080]   Because I think that to me
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.940]   is one of the more unusual aspects to psychedelics
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.000]   is that normally the social pressure,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.420]   but also just our internal pressure from our own brain
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.460]   is pay attention to many things at once, not just one.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.600]   - Especially these days.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.140]   Yeah, multitask. - Exactly.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.480]   Multitask and the more that we focus on one thing,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.420]   the more bizarre that thing actually can appear to us, right?
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.260]   - Right.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.420]   - I mean, even if it's the tip of your finger
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.660]   and you're not taking any psychedelics,
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.420]   you spent a long enough looking at the tip of your finger,
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.940]   you will notice some very weird things, right?
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.260]   - I think of that as the classic psychedelic effect
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.540]   or one classic effect
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.700]   and one I've used many times of this example
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.300]   of why people shouldn't necessarily, you know,
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.140]   these aren't,
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.940]   these, one should be judicious
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.140]   in putting themselves in these circumstances.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.420]   Someone could be, you know,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.480]   having a very strong psilocybin experience
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.660]   and they're trying to navigate their way in Manhattan
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.620]   crossing the street
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.380]   and they might be staring into the hand and realize,
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.740]   like that's, their hand is the most amazing miracle.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.500]   Like the entire universe has essentially conspired
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.340]   to come to this one point
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.600]   to make this absolutely breathtaking.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.680]   It's almost like, I think of the simplest form of,
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.180]   well, we know that the simplest form of learning
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.020]   is habituation.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.340]   Simply keep applying stimuli and there's less response.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.340]   Like this is what organisms do.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.620]   This is what we have to do.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.580]   And it's like, there's this dishabituation component.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.780]   - Dishabituation.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.800]   - Yes, like we wouldn't be able to get through life
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.500]   if we wouldn't be able to cross that street
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.860]   if we were like, oh, like this is a miracle.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.700]   - Well, I'm so glad you brought this up.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.180]   I mean, here, I'm reflecting my bias as a vision scientist,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.740]   but most people don't realize this,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.200]   but if you look at something long enough,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.460]   it eventually disappears.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.500]   It doesn't actually disappear,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.020]   but perceptually it disappears.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.420]   You have these little microsaccades
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.100]   that ensure that it doesn't,
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.860]   but most of us don't look at any one thing for very long.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.900]   The brain's default is to perceptually jump around
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.120]   like crazy with the visual system, with the auditory system.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.480]   We all, ADD, people talk about ADD a lot,
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.600]   is sort of baked into our underlying networks at some level.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.000]   And then we can force attention.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.960]   But it sounds like on psychedelics,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.820]   one of the primary goals therapeutically
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:03.580]   is to really drill into one of these perceptual bubbles
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.860]   and expand that bubble.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.340]   And the safety it seems is the safety,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.280]   it's sort of like a permission to do that
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.120]   without worrying that something's going to happen.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.420]   - Right, because I've had people there on the couch.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.100]   Yeah, I remember one lady said,
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.420]   this is probably 13, 14 years ago,
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   said, "Matt, tell me again, I can't die.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.220]   I feel like my heart is going to rip through my chest."
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.300]   I mean, she was feeling her.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.660]   And I should say, typically cardiovascular response
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.420]   is modest, the pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.720]   It can be dangerous for people
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.100]   if they're at severe heart risk.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.420]   And we do monitoring this the whole time.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.480]   - So they're plugged into a variety of devices?
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.840]   - Yeah, so every half hour or so we take their on protocol
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.320]   and we space it out a little further,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.760]   further into the time course,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.120]   but we take their blood pressure and their pulse.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.360]   And if it goes over a certain level, we have a protocol.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.640]   And we've had to do this only a few times,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.360]   but the physician comes in,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.640]   gives them a little nitroglycerin under the tongue
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.840]   and knocks the blood pressure down a little bit,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.040]   doesn't affect the experience.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.360]   So we have it all in place,
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.440]   even though they'd probably be fine
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.080]   out of an abundance of caution.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.020]   But yeah, but someone can feel that,
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.240]   my God, I'm going to die.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.200]   Like I have never felt my heart beat like this before.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.380]   And like the experience of the breath can be just,
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.180]   you know, absolutely fantastic.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.900]   And the breath is obviously interesting
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.220]   because it's this automatic control,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.100]   but it can also be voluntary.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.140]   So people can get into a sense of like,
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.780]   my God, what if I forget?
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.620]   It sounds silly like a stoner movie.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.860]   - What if I forget to breathe?
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.060]   - Exactly.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.500]   But people, that can be so compelling.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   And so one of the reasons,
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.840]   get back to one of your questions,
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.800]   it's like, what do we do to kind of allow them
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.540]   to go further into these bubbles?
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.100]   It's like, one is wearing the eye shades.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.740]   We don't call them blindfolds
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.340]   'cause that has a negative connotation like being kidnapped.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.140]   - And they're probably seeing a lot in there anyway.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.820]   So blind isn't the appropriate word.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.260]   - Right, right.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.100]   I've never thought of it.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.260]   These should be like inner sight shades.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.940]   But when you close the eyes, the levels of activity
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.100]   in the retina actually are maintained.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.120]   It's just spontaneous activity.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.540]   - And it seems, and I'd be curious
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.060]   about your thoughts on this.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:25.480]   But the way I describe it is that the mind's eye,
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.300]   being this kind of loose term we use,
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.820]   can be on rocket boosters.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.980]   So a lot of times, for some people,
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.280]   like a compound like psilocybin,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.340]   for some people, there's no perceptual effect.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.500]   Like if they're looking at this room,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.680]   it would pretty much look the same.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.180]   Sometimes folks say, "Yeah, things seem
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.020]   a little bit brighter."
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.780]   Now, some people will say, "Oh my God,
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.140]   there's waves, that wall is waving,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.780]   and these curtains are..."
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.400]   On these compounds, people don't typically see pink elephants.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.220]   You do actually get that in another class.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.540]   I didn't mention the anticholinergics,
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.220]   sort of like atropine and scopolamine, those drugs.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.140]   Those are the true hallucinations
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.220]   where you thought you were having a conversation
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.860]   with someone who was never there.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:08.120]   - We will definitely get to those.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.140]   But the reason I kind of cringe and say,
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.780]   "Oh my," when you talked about those,
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.180]   is that knowing a little bit about the pharmacology
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.900]   of acetylcholine, the idea of manipulating that system,
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.440]   to me, sounds very uncomfortable.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.900]   Because like the whole idea of, well, witches and flying,
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.720]   there was a whole history there hundreds of years ago,
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.640]   so-called witches taking these agents
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.620]   and then thinking they were flying around on broomsticks
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.660]   and things of that sort.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.580]   And there's a lot of mythology around the broomsticks.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.500]   It's complicated, but that sounds very unpleasant.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.800]   One thing about the serotonergic,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   let's just, with psilocybin,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.360]   so there's an expansion of a particular,
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.960]   fairly narrow percept.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.580]   It could be sound, it could be an emotion,
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.640]   it could be sadness, could be a historical event
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.020]   or a fear of the future.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.180]   And you've mentioned before that there's something
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.600]   to be learned in that experience.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.020]   There's something about going into that experience
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   in an undeterred way that allows somebody
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:20.740]   to bring something back into more standard reality.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.060]   Given the huge variety of experiences
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.500]   that people have on psychedelics,
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.160]   given the huge variety of humans that are out there,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.260]   but what are now very clear therapeutic effects
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.140]   in the realm of depression,
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.500]   what do you think is the value
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.020]   of going into this fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.320]   what we are calling letting go or giving up control?
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.840]   Because if the experiences are many,
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.720]   but the value of what one exports from that experience
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.580]   is kind of similar across individuals,
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.800]   that raises all sorts of interesting questions.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.940]   And this is not a philosophy discussion.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   We're talking about biology and psychology here.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.040]   So let's say I decide I'm going to focus
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.260]   on the tip of my pen.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.780]   I mean, in a psychedelic state,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.120]   I could fall in love with this pen.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.260]   I do happen to like these Pilot V5s and V7s very much,
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.200]   but I could feel real love for the pen, right?
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.700]   That's not an unreasonable thing
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.180]   to expect in a psychedelic journey.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.940]   And in the context of your laboratory model,
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.380]   which I think is a great one,
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.880]   that experience would be just as valid
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.580]   as me going into the experience
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.200]   of some of the deep friction that I might have
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.080]   with a family member over my entire lifespan.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.780]   And yet the export from that,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.900]   those two vastly different experiences
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.360]   is one of feeling a better relationship
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.920]   to the world into oneself.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.760]   So what does this tell us about-
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.620]   - Like how can the pen
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.200]   and the processing your childhood trauma both lead to?
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.040]   - Right.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.180]   So what does this, I mean, at that level,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:57.980]   it raises this question like, first of all, how, why?
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.060]   I mean, or just what are your thoughts on that?
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.080]   - So this is definitely in the,
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.760]   this is in the terrain we're figuring out, you know?
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.060]   So there's no, educated speculation
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.640]   is the best I can provide.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.660]   But I think the best,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.860]   I think the common denominator
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.900]   are persisting changes in self-representation.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.100]   - Okay, tell me more about self-representation.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.660]   - That's the way one holds the sense of self.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.920]   The fundamental relationship of a person in the world.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.780]   I mentioned earlier that these experience
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.500]   seems to alter the models we hold of reality.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.540]   And I think that the self is the biggest model,
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.300]   that I am a thing that's separate from other things.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.420]   And that's, I am defined by certain,
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.860]   I have a certain personality
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.520]   and I'm a smoker that's having a hard time quitting,
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.540]   or I'm a depressed person that, you know,
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.580]   views myself as a failure and all of these things.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.820]   Those are models too.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.420]   And I think that change in self-representation
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.020]   may be an end point for these different experiences.
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.940]   I mean, maybe the falling in love with the pen,
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.260]   the whole idea that you're,
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.920]   especially in contemplation afterwards,
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.300]   and obviously I'm speculating here,
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.580]   but the whole idea that you could
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.060]   have such a deep connection with this random,
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.700]   obviously random aspect of the universe
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.620]   could potentially lead to this, you know,
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.780]   transformed understanding of the self.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.580]   And like the pen may be a proxy for the miracle of reality,
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.260]   in a way that relies nothing on no supernatural thinking.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.940]   You know, you can be a hard atheist and take this,
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.820]   ultimately, oh my God, like that,
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.220]   just like the pen, this is, you know,
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.580]   this is amazing the fact that we exist.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.040]   And so there could be an extrapolation chair
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.500]   and you use the pen, but I think it sounds so similar
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.940]   to Aldous Huxley's classic description
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.860]   on the doors of perception of the chair and the drapes.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.220]   Like he took 500 milligrams of mescaline.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.060]   He was just like-
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.140]   - Is that a high dose of mescaline?
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.460]   And that's a, you know, that's a heroic dose for sure.
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.280]   And he just going off on the chairiness of the chair,
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.260]   like this chair is exuding the quality of being a chair.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.120]   - So this is this expansion of the perceptual bubble,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.980]   a narrow, a narrow percept that then grows
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.080]   within the confines of that narrow percept.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.980]   - Yeah.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.100]   - So sense of self is a very interesting phenomenon.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   And if we could dissect it a little bit,
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.640]   there's the somatic sense of self.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.620]   So the ability to literally feel the self
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.780]   into this process we call interoception.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.020]   And then there's the title of the self, the I am blank.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.860]   - Yeah.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.740]   - And I noticed you said that several times.
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.860]   It's intriguing to me.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.900]   I have a good friend.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.620]   I don't think I can or should mention his name,
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.140]   but he had a very long and successful career
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.700]   within one of the more elite teams
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.980]   and within the SEAL teams.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.860]   And he's a fairly philosophical guy,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.480]   also very practical guy,
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.700]   but he has said many times to me
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:08.700]   that the most powerful words in any language are I am,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.420]   because whatever follows that tends,
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.580]   if you repeat it enough,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.380]   tends to have this kind of feedback effect
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.820]   on how you are in the world.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.460]   And the first pass, it sounded to me a little bit
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.940]   like kind of like internet psychology type thing,
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.300]   like the secret or something,
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.500]   which frankly, I'm just not particularly.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.920]   Yeah, so if you kind of like the whole fake it
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.760]   till you make it,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.460]   like I don't actually subscribe to any of that.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.660]   But in dissecting that a little bit further with him,
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:41.080]   I came to realize that these words I am are very powerful.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.660]   I don't think you reprogram your brain just by saying them,
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:48.660]   but how one defines themselves internally,
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.260]   not just to other people,
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.300]   but how one psychologically and by default
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.220]   defines themselves, I think is a very powerful,
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.940]   like and depressed people,
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.020]   as well as happy people seem to define themselves
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.780]   in terms of these categories of emotional states.
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.060]   So I think it's so interesting that letting go
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.960]   and going into this perceptual bubble,
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.560]   which is facilitated by obviously a really wonderful team
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.780]   of therapists, but also the serotonergic agent,
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.780]   allows us to potentially reshape the perception of self.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.420]   That's a tremendous feat of neuroplasticity.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:30.720]   - Right, and I think certainly more work needs to be done.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.000]   This is the horizon.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.440]   And I should credit Chris Lethaby,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.220]   a philosopher in Australia who has a forthcoming book.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.640]   It might be out right about now or soon,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.280]   within the coming months, "Psychodelics and Philosophy."
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.300]   - That's the title of the book?
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.080]   - It might be "Psychodelic Philosophy."
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.920]   It's really close.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.760]   - Chris Lethaby, we'll put a link to it.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.260]   - Right, and so his conclusion in this,
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.540]   it's a really great book and he really plays with the idea.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.440]   It's like psychedelic experiences come along
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.400]   with a lot of supernatural stuff, experience.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.900]   It can certainly go along with that,
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.760]   but the idea is like, can these experiences
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.360]   and including those therapeutic effects
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.900]   be explained from a naturalist point of view?
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.200]   And his conclusion is that the changes
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.820]   in self-representation may be the commonality.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.820]   Now that could go along with plant spirits
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.820]   and the Buddha and chakras and whatever your model system,
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:34.800]   in Jesus, all of that, but it could also be completely devoid
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.480]   of any supernatural, any religious.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.860]   And we do, in fact, see all of these varieties.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.920]   So I think there's something about this change
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.760]   in sense of self.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.160]   There seems to be something on the identity level,
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.960]   both with, I think, of the work we did with cancer patients
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.760]   who had substantial depression and anxiety
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.640]   because of their cancer, and also our work
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.520]   with people trying to quit cigarette smoking.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   I mean, there seems to be, when it really works,
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.360]   this change in how people view themselves,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   like with smoking, like really stepping out of this model,
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.640]   like I'm a smoker, it's tough to quit smoking cigarettes,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.420]   I can't do it, I failed a bunch of times.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.800]   I remember one participant during the session,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.680]   but he held onto this afterwards, said,
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.800]   my God, it's like, I can really just decide,
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.400]   like flicking off a bucket, I can decide not to smoke.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.440]   And I call these duh experiences with psychedelics
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.800]   'cause people often, like in the cancer study,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.160]   you say, I'm causing most of my own suffering.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.800]   Like I can follow my appointments, I can do everything,
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.000]   but I can still plan for the vacation,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.880]   I'm not getting outside in the sunshine,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.680]   I'm not playing with my grandkids, I'm choosing to do that.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.020]   And it's like, they told themselves that before,
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.920]   and the smoker has told themselves a million times,
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.160]   I can, so it sounds, when it comes out of their mouths,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.320]   and folks will say, this is part of the ineffability
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.080]   of a psychedelic experience, folks say,
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.360]   I know this sounds like bullshit, and this sounds like,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.400]   but my God, I could just sigh.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.000]   Like they're feeling this gravity of agency,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   which I think is interesting 'cause regardless
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.660]   of the debates on the reality of free will,
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.320]   I think the philosophy of that,
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.840]   whether it's ultimately free will,
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.320]   like pure agency, if that exists, which I'm skeptical of,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.600]   or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency,
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.360]   there's something there,
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.840]   whether it's the sense of agency even,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.520]   that is the human being has,
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   and that seems to be at times fundamentally like supercharged
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.180]   from a psychedelic experience, this idea like,
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.760]   I'm just gonna make a decision.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.620]   Like normally, like you tell a depressed person,
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.320]   like don't think of yourself that way,
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.760]   you're not a failure, look at all that.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.560]   It's just, yeah, it's like, and well,
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.400]   you can actually in one of these states have an experience
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.880]   where you realize like, my God,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   just like using MDMA to treat PTSD,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.320]   and we're gonna be starting work
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.080]   with psilocybin to treat PTSD,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.740]   someone could really reprocess their trauma
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.760]   in a way that like has lasting effects.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.640]   And clearly there's probably something,
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.500]   reconsolidation of those memories.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:19.280]   They are altered, very consistent with our understanding
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.360]   of the way memory works.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.760]   So the whole idea, people can actually in a few hours
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.440]   have such a profound experience
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.100]   that they decide to make these changes in who they are,
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.620]   and it sticks.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.320]   There seems to be something like that.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.480]   - And that's profound.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.680]   I mean, I think a few moments ago,
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.400]   I made some semi-disparaging statements
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.840]   about things like the secret and affirmations.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.680]   And the reason I do that with a nod to the fact
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.460]   that the people who are putting those ideas forward
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.720]   are well-intentioned people is that the neural networks
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.660]   of the brain put language last.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:03.040]   We tell stories, and stories are very powerful,
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.680]   but I think one of the most cruel aspects
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.880]   of the whole self-help literature in popular psychology
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.880]   is this idea that everything you say,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.820]   your brain and body hear it.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.240]   That's actually a very unkind or even cruel thing
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.060]   for people who are depressed or anxious to hear,
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.080]   because if they hear that and believe that,
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.280]   and I want to be clear, I don't think it's true,
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.600]   that they think that it's very hard to control thoughts.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.520]   It's very hard to control thoughts.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.240]   So if somebody says, I can't, and then somebody says,
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.700]   well, no, every time you say you can't,
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.480]   your brain hears that and it reinforces it,
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.760]   that's a very treacherous place to live.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:47.480]   And language is powerful, but neural networks,
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.080]   the brain and the networks that underlie emotionality
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.160]   and perception and sense of self,
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.020]   they don't change in response to language.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.240]   They change in response to experience.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.660]   And it just fundamentally, you need,
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.720]   there are some prerequisites.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.640]   You need certain neuromodulators present,
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.480]   like serotonin or dopamine.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.240]   You need them to be at sufficient levels.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.900]   You don't need a drug necessarily do it.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.560]   You could, you know, you give a kid a kitten or a puppy,
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.840]   their first kitten or puppy,
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.740]   and the levels of dopamine and serotonin,
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.580]   I've never measured them,
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.520]   but we can be pretty sure
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.840]   that they are higher than baseline.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.500]   And that experience will reshape them, right?
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.340]   - Yeah.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.280]   - Likewise with an adult in a certain circumstances.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.400]   So I think I'm fascinated by this idea
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:35.900]   that a somatic and a perceptual experience,
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:39.400]   but a real experience of the sort that you're describing
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.920]   is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.780]   and to feel differently about ourselves.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:48.680]   And I know there's been really tremendous success
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.420]   in many individuals of alleviating depression,
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.140]   of treating trauma with these different compounds.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.200]   I want to step from the experience
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.600]   under the effects of the psychedelic.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.300]   So the person there with your team,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.160]   they go into this expanded perceptual bubble.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.000]   If things go well,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.040]   they're able to do that to a really deep degree.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.360]   Maybe it's the relive trauma.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.600]   Maybe it's the beauty of their ability
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.920]   to connect to things in the world.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.880]   And now I want to talk about the transition out of that state
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.980]   and then the export into life,
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.360]   because this is really where the power of psychedelics
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.480]   seems to be in the therapeutic sense,
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.560]   is the ability to truly learn from that experience
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.880]   so that the learning becomes the default,
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.320]   that one doesn't have to remind themselves,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.940]   oh, I am, they don't have to do an affirmation.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.080]   I am a happy person.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.940]   I am a happy, you know, I was saying a Bart Simpson,
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.600]   like writing on the chalkboard, right?
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.440]   Didn't work for him.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.300]   Doesn't work for this other stuff too.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.400]   But so as they transition out of this state,
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.760]   I know that there's a kind of a heightened,
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.440]   there's a so-called peak where everything seems
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.640]   to be kind of cascading in at such a level
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.800]   that the person just,
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.640]   they can't really turn it off at that point.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.840]   It would be challenging.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:04.880]   And then they start to exit the effects of the drug.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.200]   Are those transition zones, are those valuable,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.800]   much like is the transition between a dream
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   and the waking state valuable?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.520]   Because you're in a sort of mishmash of altered reality
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.360]   and new reality.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.200]   - Right.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.480]   - What do you do to guide people through the,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.200]   out the tunnel as they exit the tunnel?
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.320]   - And I have to say like,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.200]   this is where we need more experimentation.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.400]   Really the clinical model goes back
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.960]   to literally the late 1950s.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.400]   And there's been virtually no experimentation on,
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.000]   let's say, you know, randomized people to,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.040]   we're going to talk more during the latter half
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.640]   of the session versus not, versus we have them, you know,
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.160]   write an essay after their session versus not,
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.320]   versus we had this amount of integration.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.160]   What's the discussion?
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.960]   - In your studies, are they writing or talking
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.800]   as they're doing it?
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.160]   - And it's called, you know, very loosey-goosey,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.600]   you know, term integration.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.600]   But for us means as they're coming back from the experience
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.040]   to sort of five, six hours in, you know,
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.160]   so this is the afternoon,
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.640]   they've been dosed around nine o'clock.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.120]   So this is like four o'clock or so.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.400]   Just some initial, tell us about the experience.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.320]   Do you want to, not unpacking it totally,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.440]   but kind of initially just have a little bit discussion
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.280]   before they go home.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.800]   So there's a little bit of that.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.440]   But then that night, their homework is to write something.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.720]   So it could be, you know, a few bullet points.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.640]   It could be, you know, 20 pages and we get everything,
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.000]   you know, in that range.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.880]   But, you know, try not to be self-critical.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.720]   It's not great at like, this is just to process
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.560]   and for a point of discussion the next day.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.000]   So they write something, they come in the next day
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.940]   for a one to two hour,
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.140]   depending on the study, integration session.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.360]   Basically, let's discuss your experience
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.440]   and depending on what study it's in,
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.160]   like what might that mean for you're dealing with cancer?
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.460]   What might that mean for your smoking?
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.440]   Or becoming a non-smoker?
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.960]   So you encourage them to simply take it seriously.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.400]   And I think this is, again,
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.840]   is sort of one of the points that could be the antithesis
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.880]   of what some just kind of social users use.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.240]   I mean, this was written about by Houston Smith,
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.300]   the scholar of religion,
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.780]   in terms of these mystical experiences
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.200]   that can happen from psychedelics
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.880]   and how a lot of times the attribution
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.720]   to a drug effect is dismissed.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.540]   Like even if one has this, you know,
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.120]   this sense of being one with the universe
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.900]   and it totally like shakes their soul, so to speak,
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.600]   you know, but the next day their friends are like,
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.820]   "Oh dude, you were screwed up.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.740]   Too much acid for you, woo!"
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.720]   You know, like, "Man, next time you needed
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.940]   to have a few more beers to like bring that down."
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.460]   You know, like this sort of like, you know,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.960]   social, you know, reinforcement
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.780]   for dismissing the experience.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.040]   "Oh God, you're talking out of your head, man."
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.180]   Like, you know, even if it's, you know, good-natured,
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.400]   but it's this dismissal.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.620]   It's not like, you know, what you want to do, you know,
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.300]   is like, "Tell me more about that.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.040]   You know, you were crying at one point,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.360]   like in talking about your mom.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.300]   Let's talk about that.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.140]   What was that like?
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.040]   Do you remember that?"
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.740]   - So are you doing that follow-up
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.640]   or are they encouraged to do that in their own life
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.080]   with the various people in their life?
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.900]   - Both, so we do that explicitly in the follow-up
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.260]   where we have these discussions.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:26.540]   And I, depending on what the situation is,
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.780]   you might encourage the person to kind of follow up.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.780]   It's really, the basics of it is supportive therapy.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.380]   It's non-structured.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.140]   It's, you know, use all the, you know, reflective listening
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.540]   and the sort of the humanistic psychology thing,
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.220]   you know, unconditional positive regard for the person.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.940]   But, you know, I think if, you know,
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.660]   if someone feels inclined to, you know,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:56.660]   apologize to their sibling about something,
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.440]   it's like, "Yeah, go ahead and call them up."
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.160]   When it, with something big, like a relationship change,
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   I'd be like, "Sit on that two weeks.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.540]   Don't make any big, don't end any relationship.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.560]   Don't quit your job.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.560]   Don't make any big-"
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.300]   - Do you also tell them not to start any relationships?
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.660]   - I don't remember that ever coming up.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.820]   - Interesting, I'm not Joey.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.880]   I was just wondering, you know, but it makes sense
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.720]   why you move on.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.760]   - Like if they're dating and they're thinking like,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.240]   "Ah, it might be time to take it to the next level.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.260]   Should I ask this girl to marry me?"
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.260]   If it did come up, I would say there too.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.780]   Why don't you sit on that a week or two
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.440]   and let your sober mind- - Yeah, don't get a puppy.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.420]   Don't get a puppy.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:36.180]   Certainly don't get four puppies until you're...
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.240]   I have a question about flashbacks.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.080]   - Uh-huh.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.700]   - You know, one of the kind of things you hear is,
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.020]   you know, flashbacks and that people,
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.620]   do people get flashbacks?
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.700]   And if so, what is the basis of flashbacks?
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:54.700]   The on the street lore about this
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.380]   is that somehow some of the compound gets stored
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.460]   in body fat tissues and then released later,
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.900]   like is that complete nonsense?
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.280]   - No evidence for that.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.460]   So probably complete nonsense.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.900]   - Flashbacks are nonsense or the storage in body fat
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.740]   is complete nonsense?
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.020]   - The storage in body fat.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.340]   So to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense,
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.420]   we have to define it.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.660]   So I really think these are multiple constructs
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.480]   that are going on.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.620]   It's not the same thing that fall under that term.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.460]   There is a phenomenon that appears real
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.420]   that's called hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.420]   It's in the DSM.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.300]   A certain number of people,
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:35.760]   very small number of people percentage wise
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.100]   who have used psychedelics
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.140]   will have these persisting perceptual disorders.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.760]   Like they'll see halos around things.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.120]   They'll see some trails, like, you know,
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.420]   like the after images following an object in motion.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.300]   They'll see distortions in color.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.420]   And it'll be like anything else
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.660]   that's a disorder in the DSM.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.180]   It has to be clinically distressing
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:01.340]   and it has to be persisting over some number of months.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.900]   And so very rare, very mysterious.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.440]   Some of the keys to that are amazingly,
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.460]   it's never been seen in the thousands of participants
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.700]   either from the older era,
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.580]   from the late fifties to the early seventies,
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.460]   people in psychedelic studies with LSD, psilocybin, masculine
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.140]   and it's never been seen in the modern era.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.720]   Again, now with thousands of participants
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.540]   at a number of centers like ours throughout the world.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:30.500]   So it seems to be something that is
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.860]   for some reason happening in illicit use.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:38.260]   So that brings in, okay, is there polypharmacology?
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.940]   You know, like, cause you're drinking during it.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940]   - Did you take what you thought you'd do?
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.460]   - Yeah, what's the dose, what's the purity?
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:46.660]   But then also what I think is actually even more so
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.100]   than that what's likely going on
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.020]   is some sort of very rare neurological susceptibility.
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:55.420]   There is one paper that is a case series
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.180]   of individuals reporting these symptoms
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.900]   and they didn't limit it to just people
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.620]   who had had hallucinogen history.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.700]   And the amazing thing about this is that
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.660]   a number of people seem to have straight up HPPD diagnosis.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.780]   - What is HPPD?
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.060]   - Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.040]   who have never taken a psychedelic.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   So it's often prompted by alcohol, benzodiazepines,
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.660]   cannabis, even tobacco.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.460]   And I believe in one individual,
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.180]   no lifetime history of any,
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:36.020]   it wasn't preceded by any of those, you know, substance uses.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:41.020]   So I think of it like the precipitation exacerbation
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.660]   of psychotic disorders.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.740]   It seems pretty clear through observation
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.920]   that some people with either predisposition
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.860]   or active psychotic disease,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.720]   that this can destabilize them.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.300]   A psychedelic, the same way that a life experience
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.360]   can destabilize those person more easily.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.640]   I think of it like that there's probably
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.680]   some pretty rare neurological susceptibility.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.580]   We have tended going, this goes back to the '80s,
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.180]   you know, clinical practice.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.760]   It ended up in the DSM focused on hallucinogen
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   because I relate it to the psychology of xenophobia.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.780]   It's always the weird other thing that gets the attribution.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.080]   You don't attribute to the thing like,
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.620]   oh yeah, did you smoke cigarettes?
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.460]   Did you drink?
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.660]   It's like, well, yeah, but I see lots of people drinking
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.020]   and not ending up with this.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:29.120]   Like you take a crazy like drug
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.220]   and you can get people to believe all sorts of crazy stuff.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:35.380]   The biggest example of that is the cathinone derivative,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.900]   so-called bath salts.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.140]   And if you remember several years back,
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.820]   the guy in Florida that ate the other guy's face,
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.000]   there was a homeless guy that like literally
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.660]   ate part of someone's face off.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.500]   Like, yeah, it's one of the crazies.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.900]   - While the person was alive.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.540]   - While the person was alive.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.780]   And all it took was one sheriff's deputy to say,
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.620]   well, I don't know,
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.680]   but I bet it was some of that bath salts stuff
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.520]   that's been going on.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.360]   The only thing-
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.740]   - What was it?
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.700]   - The only thing in his system-
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.580]   - Maybe we can set the record straight for people.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.740]   What was the, why would he say bath salts?
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.420]   And was it bath salts?
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.660]   - It wasn't.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.460]   And so the only thing in his talks was cannabis,
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.580]   which we all know,
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.620]   typically people don't eat people's faces off
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.460]   after they get stef-
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.220]   - Makes you hungrier, but not that hungry.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.140]   - Right, right.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.900]   So it's just an example of the xenophobia.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.860]   Like today, if you get on Google images and look up,
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.180]   bath salts, one of the most common images you'll see
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.460]   is this poor guy's face being eaten off.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.580]   So we're just so ready to latch on,
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.180]   just like the people of another culture
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.020]   that we don't know of.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:42.020]   It's very easy to assign attribution to a class
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.620]   that you're very unfamiliar with.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.780]   So I think they, the psychedelics got that attribution
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.420]   with this very rare neurological susceptibility,
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.860]   the way that alcohol didn't.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.080]   So I think it's not specific to psychedelics,
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.940]   but we don't really know.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.020]   We need, but we look at it and our research
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.640]   have never seen an example of it.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.740]   But flashbacks can mean a number of other things.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.620]   I think the most common thing people experience
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.900]   is what we call state dependent learning.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.260]   It's returning yourself to a similar context
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.220]   can bring back the same thoughts and emotions
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.060]   as the experience.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.820]   So someone used mushrooms a week ago,
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:22.420]   now they do something like they smoke some cannabis
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:27.420]   or they take a warm bath or they're simply like relaxed
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.600]   and it seems to come out of the blue
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.980]   and all of a sudden these,
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.740]   or they follow a thought trail that takes them,
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.820]   that reminds them of their,
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:39.940]   and they find themselves in that same experience again.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.060]   I think that's more state dependent learning.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.480]   It's not the distressing component that is in
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   and it's typically not perceptual.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   And then another class are just sort of perceptual anomalies
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.840]   within a day or two following the experience,
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.580]   which is not HPPD.
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.720]   Most people have joked that this is a free trip.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.020]   Like you might see a few trails or halos the day afterwards.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.620]   It doesn't last longer than that.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.340]   And it doesn't screw you up.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.160]   It's kind of fun.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.580]   Like, oh yeah, I'm still seeing some trail.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.420]   Most people will say.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.180]   So it could mean any of those things.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.060]   So flashback is, yeah.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:17.900]   - Interesting.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.220]   No, I appreciate you clarifying that.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.980]   I mean, one very common misconception about neuroplasticity
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:28.860]   is that it's an event and it's not an event, it's a process.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.320]   And we have no understanding of the duration
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.780]   of that process.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.780]   However, the experience of any drug or any life experience,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.980]   even if it's a trauma or a wonderful experience
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.360]   or a psychedelic experience, doesn't matter.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.980]   Sets in motion a series of dominoes that fall.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.540]   And it's the falling of those dominoes
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.020]   that we call neuroplasticity.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.140]   I mean, the reshaping of neural circuits could take years.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.080]   We don't know.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.100]   It's the trigger and then there's the actual change.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.500]   And so I think that some of what you described
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.740]   could be literally the reordering of circuitry,
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.540]   that in some individuals might extend longer than others.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.340]   And there is one phenomenon
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.380]   that I've been told people experience.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.620]   And I'm wondering whether or not any of the patients
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.280]   you've worked with or people in your trials
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.560]   have reported this.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.100]   I've never done ayahuasca,
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.900]   which I'm assuming has some overlap
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.020]   with the serotonin system.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.100]   Probably hits a variety of systems.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.860]   - So it's DMT, the active. - The DMT system.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.940]   - Yeah, it's orally active. - Right, excuse me.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:31.760]   That's right.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.340]   - MAO inhibitors that allow the DMT
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.180]   to be orally.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.580]   - Right, I should have recalled that, absolutely.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.420]   Well, I've never done it,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.700]   but a number of people I know that have done ayahuasca
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.760]   as well as people I know who have done MDMA
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.140]   report an increased sense of what are sometimes called ASMR,
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.000]   these autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, which is,
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:53.840]   and it's interesting,
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.880]   a lot of people have these naturally and they hide these.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.680]   It's actually something that many people
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.180]   keep hidden to themselves.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.700]   I'll just ask you if you can do it.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.620]   So some people are able to pass a,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.440]   like a shiver down their spine
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.460]   or up their spine consciously.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.900]   You know, like you can kind of,
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.480]   I'm able to actually pass a shiver up my spine.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.980]   I actually learned how to do this when I was a kid
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.820]   on a hot day.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.300]   I was standing on a field in sports camp
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.420]   and I was like, it's really hot here.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:24.220]   And I could actually create like a cooled perception.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.140]   Some people, I've told someone this once
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.660]   and then this led to a discussion of,
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.520]   oh, I can do it, but I always hid that from people.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.580]   'Cause it's actually somewhat pleasurable.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.260]   And this is a well-known phenomenon, ASMR.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.000]   And some people I know who have taken MDMA therapeutically
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   or ayahuasca will report that they feel great relief
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.180]   from this, they can generate these autonomic reflexes
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.220]   through their body more readily.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.700]   Probably, I'm guessing, because they were able to tune in
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.280]   to a kind of deeper sense of somatic self.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.980]   Now on the internet, ASMR, if you look it up,
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.420]   it's a little bit like the bath salt thing,
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:00.460]   but in the other direction,
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.200]   like there were people that pay,
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.000]   let's just say there are accounts on YouTube
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.700]   that have many, many millions of viewers
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.580]   of people that will whisper to them about,
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.420]   like for instance, there's people that will go listen to,
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.940]   it seems to be women in particular,
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.900]   whispering about like car mechanics or something
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.580]   or about, or scratching.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.500]   So there are certain sounds will do this,
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.820]   whispering, tapping, finger tapping,
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.120]   and people experience immense pleasure from it.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.540]   It's not really sexual pleasure,
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.520]   but it's this kind of deep core of the body.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.180]   It's the autonomic nervous system
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.020]   down the core of the spine.
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.260]   - Probably what a certain number of people
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.020]   would call Kundalini, which is another one,
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.340]   scientifically who, yeah.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.660]   - That's right, and people who do long duration
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.360]   Kundalini breathing sessions,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.140]   many of them will report later feeling as if
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.980]   their perception of self is outside of their head,
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.660]   that they're literally walking,
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.420]   it's very uncomfortable for them,
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.040]   that they feel like they're walking around
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.380]   with their sense of self extended beyond the body.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.460]   And this is a clinically described neurologic phenomenon.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.480]   - Have any studies been done?
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.900]   I would imagine that person might actually like,
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.420]   would they duck?
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.260]   - Oh, what?
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.300]   - Like that would be an interesting experiment.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.260]   - That would be the kind of thing my lab
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.420]   would want to get into.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.680]   - Yeah, their body could clear,
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.460]   but their projection wouldn't.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.660]   - Yeah, the sense of self,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.380]   I mean, there's a well-known phenomenon.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.180]   It's very, in a few individuals, very sad,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:24.020]   where people actually avidly seek out
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.220]   amputation of their limbs
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.620]   because their limbs they feel don't belong to their body.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.460]   - Oh yeah.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.020]   - So it's very, very sad and fortunately very rare,
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.640]   but also very sad condition.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.660]   Anyway, I think that the core of this conversation
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.900]   that we're drilling into is this notion
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.580]   of reordering the self.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.700]   And it's a relief to me to know that flashbacks
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.860]   are not something that is kind of, forgive the term,
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.860]   baked in to the psychedelic experience.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.320]   And I suppose that's a good segue
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.420]   to ask about other sorts of drugs.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.300]   Having said baked in,
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.620]   the temptation is to go to marijuana or cannabis,
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:04.260]   but if we could, I'd like to just ask
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.900]   about some of the more dopaminergic compounds,
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.340]   in particular MDMA.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.260]   - Yeah.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.540]   - My understanding is that MDMA
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.180]   is a purely synthetic compound,
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.860]   that you're not going to find MDMA in nature.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.980]   - So far.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.820]   - So far.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.780]   - DMT was first synthesized in the lab
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.100]   and then we thought it didn't exist in nature.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:27.180]   And then like Richard Schultes found it like everywhere.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.660]   - In South America.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.060]   Who knows, a plant out there might be making MDMA,
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.040]   but as far as we know now, no.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.260]   - Right, and we'll talk about DMT
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.720]   and its sources within the body.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.720]   But MDMA could exist elsewhere, but has been synthesized.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.740]   And my understanding is that MDMA
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.420]   leads to very robust increases
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:50.660]   in both dopamine and serotonin simultaneously,
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:55.100]   which from a neural network's perspective
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.660]   is a very unusual situation, right?
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.820]   Normally, because dopamine puts us in this exteroceptive,
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:01.900]   looking outside ourselves,
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:06.000]   seeking things in the world beyond the skin, our own skin,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.700]   and dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends to focus us inward.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.620]   Those are almost mutually exclusive
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.540]   kind of neurochemical states,
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.140]   although they're always at different levels.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   So why would it be that having this increased dopamine
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:25.060]   and increased serotonin would provide an experience
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.540]   that is beneficial?
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.580]   And how do you, to the extent that you can describe it,
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   how do you think that experience differs
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.100]   from the sorts of experiences that people have on psilocybin
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.960]   or more serotonergic agents, just broadly speaking?
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.340]   In terms of the effects generally on serotonin and dopamine,
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:49.060]   I can only speculate,
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.740]   like sort of is that dopaminergic component necessary
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.780]   for let's say we know that the amygdala
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.580]   is less reactive under acute effects,
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.320]   and that may play a role in,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.140]   there's less sort of a control from the amygdala
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.080]   in terms of like one's experience of memory.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   So it may be part of this sort of reprocessing,
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.720]   this reconsolidation of these memories in a different way
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.880]   where the amygdala is not like going crazy,
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.380]   saying freak out, like fight or flight.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.580]   - Well, I should have said,
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.180]   it seems like MDMA is being used clinically anyway,
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.140]   mainly for trauma, not just for depression.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:33.740]   - Although part of that, we really don't know,
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.380]   and maybe that MDMA is great for depression
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.060]   and some of these other, and it may be that,
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.300]   and I'm going to be looking at this soon,
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.060]   that psilocybin is great for treating PTSD.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.780]   A lot of underground therapists say that,
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.260]   underground psychedelic therapists.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:51.100]   So we don't really know yet which people doing illegal,
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:54.380]   but more like a professional therapist would,
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:59.340]   it's just illegal, and this is a kind of a growing thing.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:03.820]   So we don't really know which, it's speculating,
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.820]   but it may be that MDMA for a broader number of people
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.760]   is better for trauma because the chances
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.100]   of having an extremely challenging experience,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:20.800]   what I call the bad trip, like really freaking out,
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.460]   is much lower with MDMA.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.700]   People can have bad trips,
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.400]   but they're of a different nature.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.460]   It's not sort of like freaking out
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.060]   because all of reality is sort of shattering,
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.500]   and it's less of this, it can take so many forms
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.300]   with the classic psychedelics,
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.260]   but like typically you'll hear something like,
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.700]   I didn't know it was going to be like this,
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.920]   no matter how hard you tried to prepare them,
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.020]   that like, this is like, get me off this drive.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.260]   - You're talking about LSD or psilocybin?
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.480]   - Psilocybin, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.660]   And just the sense of like, I'm going insane,
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.400]   this is so far beyond anything I've ever experienced,
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.420]   and it's scaring the shit out of me.
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.940]   I don't have a toehold on anything,
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:09.340]   even that I exist as an entity.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:12.460]   And that can be really, I think, frankly, experientially,
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.620]   that's kind of the gateway
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.780]   to both the transcendental mystical experiences,
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:21.140]   the sense of unity with all things,
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.700]   which we know, our data suggests,
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:27.140]   is related to long-term positive outcomes.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.340]   - Wait, I want to make sure I understand.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.540]   So you're saying the bad trip
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.700]   can be related to the transcendental experience?
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.100]   - Right, I think those are both speculating,
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.920]   but you have to pass through this sort of like,
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.380]   reality shattering, including your sense of self.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.380]   And one can handle that in one of two ways.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.180]   You can either completely surrender to it,
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.940]   or you can try to hang on.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:50.960]   And if you try to hang on,
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.660]   it's going to be more like a bad trip.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.220]   So again, I wish there was more,
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.240]   and hopefully there will be more experimentation.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.420]   There's a lot going on here in the black box
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.620]   in terms of the operant behavior
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:04.320]   of how you are within yourself,
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.260]   choosing to handle, like letting go.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.780]   And eventually, we'll be able to see this in real time
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.380]   with brain imaging, ah, there they are surrendering
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.660]   to the psychedelic experience.
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.360]   Here they are trying to hold on, but we're not there yet.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.820]   But I think through clinical observation,
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:23.300]   it seems pretty clear that something like that is going on.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.640]   And certain drugs like DMT, smoked DMT, can be so strong.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.540]   The reason I think that can be so extraordinary,
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.380]   you can compare to the others,
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.940]   'cause it like forces people.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.780]   Like there is no choice to hang out in it.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.620]   - I've never done it.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.020]   I was told that DMT is like a high-speed locomotive
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.740]   into the psychedelic experience
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.180]   and out of the psychedelic experience.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:46.500]   And there's no ability to hold on to the self
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.820]   while you're in the kind of peak phase.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:49.660]   Is that correct?
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.940]   - A lot of people say that, but Terrence McKenna,
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:55.980]   who is kind of the classic bard on DMT effects,
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.620]   he would say the sense of self was intact,
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:03.460]   but everything else, the sensorium and what you navigated,
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.580]   what you oriented towards,
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.560]   everything else changed basically.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.260]   But it's hard to, when everything's changing,
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.600]   it's hard to say like, what is the self that's changing?
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.960]   What is the rest of the world?
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.180]   - Well, and language is totally deficient
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:19.740]   to describe experience any way, much less on a psychedelic.
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.500]   What is McKenna's background?
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.580]   Like, what is his qualification for being this,
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.020]   as you referred, this bard of DMT?
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.780]   - So, and we're talking about Terrence,
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:33.260]   and there's also the brother Dennis, whom I know who's-
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.460]   - Can only imagine what Thanksgiving dinner is like
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.440]   at their house. - Terrence passed away
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   years, a couple of decades ago now.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.420]   But he's sort of the one who's known as being a bard,
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:46.580]   and you can find hundreds, if not thousands of hours of him
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.860]   on the lecture circuit in the '80s and '90s on YouTube.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.500]   But his background was really, oh gosh,
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.500]   I don't recall what his college degree was in,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.620]   but he basically, when he was like 19,
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.840]   he traveled to South America,
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.120]   and actually on the initial trip with his brother,
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.300]   who was even younger than him, with some other friends,
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:11.140]   and just in search for a DMT snub
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.040]   that they had read about in the Harvard archives
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.980]   from the work of Schultes from a generation before,
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.680]   but they had discovered all of these mushrooms growing
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.020]   that down there, the psilocybin mushrooms,
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.880]   what they recognized, and just took a lot of mushrooms,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.700]   and- - And talked about it.
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.540]   - Talked about it.
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.520]   Terrence was basically a very intelligent,
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.300]   very well-read and literature and culture person
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.740]   that could be, he was sort of the next generation's
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.900]   Tim Leary, someone who could really speak,
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.460]   get a little closer to the magnitude
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.340]   of what the psychedelic experience was like for people.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.780]   And he served, like Leary, somewhat of an advocate.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:57.580]   I mean, he would tell people, folks, you could see
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.900]   the equivalent of a UFO landing on the White House lawn,
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.960]   like it's right there, it'll take five minutes,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.940]   it'll shake everything in your reality.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.020]   He would sort of goad people into doing it.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.640]   - Well, certainly science and clinical medicine
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.220]   are just but two lenses with which to explore
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:16.340]   these things in life.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.320]   But part of the reason I ask is I feel like,
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:24.200]   in the world of health and fitness,
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.220]   you have this very extreme condition
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:30.980]   of like Arnold Schwarzenegger's and bodybuilders
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:33.500]   who have like 2% body fat, and they look like,
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.180]   to most people, they look kind of freakish,
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.200]   especially now, right?
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.140]   - Oh, especially now.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.980]   - Especially now.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.820]   - Yeah. - And yeah.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.260]   - Made Arnold look like regular.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:43.740]   - Exactly. - Back in his day, yeah.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.660]   - Yeah, and you have contortionists
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.660]   who can put themselves into a small box
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.380]   and wrap themselves into a pretzel.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.580]   But from those two very extreme subculture practices
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.780]   that, I don't know anything about contortionism, really,
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.780]   but, except that they get really bendy,
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.540]   but it was a community that included lifestyle practices
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.800]   and nutritional practices and then drug practices.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.260]   From those very extreme subcultures,
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.320]   there's been an export, which is that,
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.240]   weight training is healthy, right?
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.200]   The general public has done that, or that yoga is healthy.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.220]   So contortionism to yoga, et cetera.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:22.320]   And I feel like a similar thing is happening
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.780]   in the realm of psychedelics,
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:28.780]   where it was Leary and Huxley.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.980]   I mean, I'm from the Bay Area.
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:32.700]   I'm not far from the Menlo Park VA,
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.340]   where One Flew Over the Cuckoos is basically based on, right?
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.420]   Ken Kesey and those guys.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:41.420]   And there has been an attempt at creating this movement
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.100]   toward openness about psychedelics
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.740]   and their positive effects.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.460]   This has happened before.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.420]   The difference is that now there are people like you
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.220]   inside the walls of the university
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.980]   or publishing peer-reviewed studies and things of that sort.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.900]   The reason I asked about McKenna was,
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.780]   it seems like McKenna and his brother are,
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:05.780]   but just two of many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera,
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:11.280]   who have no real formal training in biology or psychology,
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.660]   the other guys who were at universities lost their jobs.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.040]   They were actually removed from places like Harvard
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.380]   and other universities for their kind of
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.980]   cavalier explorations, right?
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.020]   And now things are kind of returning.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.620]   So in the same way that bodybuilding led to weight training
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.140]   in every corner gym, men, women, and children,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.400]   and contortionism is one extreme,
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.020]   but people generally think that yoga
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.220]   is a pretty healthy practice, right?
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.180]   These are matter of degrees, right?
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:44.660]   And now here you are inside the walls
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.900]   of a very highly respected university, Johns Hopkins.
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.780]   You're on the medical school side of the undergrad.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:54.780]   So in the med school, which is a serious health institution,
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.780]   the question is to me, what are the valuable exports, right?
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:05.660]   And where does the extreme lie?
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.140]   I mean, clearly there's a problem
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:13.140]   with tinkering with reality through pharmacology,
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.580]   and there's a benefit, it sounds like,
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:19.540]   to tinkering with reality through pharmacology.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.260]   And what's so striking to me is that
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:26.180]   this is the elements of atypical experience,
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.340]   atypical representation of the self.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:34.340]   So for the average person, right,
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.820]   or for kids that are hearing this,
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.820]   kids that are in their teens, right?
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.660]   - Yeah.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:41.820]   - I want to talk about what are the dangers of psychedelics?
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.580]   This is something you don't hear a lot about these days,
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.980]   and it's not because I'm anti-psychedelic at all,
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.540]   but what are the dangers, right?
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.700]   If a kid or a child, if a child is anti-psychedelic,
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.460]   a kid or adult has a predisposition toward, let's say,
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.860]   psychotic thinking, right?
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:04.860]   Or auditory hallucinations, or is on the Asperger's side
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:07.820]   of the autism spectrum.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.500]   Is there an increased risk of bringing the mind
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.620]   into these states?
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.820]   'Cause it sounds like a very labile situation.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.700]   So could we talk a little bit about that,
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.900]   and are there classes of these different drugs,
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:22.380]   whether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT that are,
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.780]   that you think are particularly sharp blades
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:28.500]   and therefore need to be wielded particularly carefully?
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:33.460]   - Yeah, so these can be profoundly destabilizing
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.940]   experiences and ones that, you know,
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.940]   ideally are had in a safe container, you know,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:46.420]   sort of where someone, you know,
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.540]   what are the relevant dangers and what can we do
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.700]   to mitigate those?
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.860]   So there's two biggies.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   One, and I've already mentioned,
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:29:00.220]   it's people with very severe psychiatric illness,
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.940]   not depression, not anxiety.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:06.660]   I'm talking about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:10.180]   or mania as part of bipolar disorder.
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.100]   So, and diagnostically, this has shifted.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.140]   So it's a little hard to say how many people today
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.100]   with bipolar would have been labeled as schizophrenia
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:20.900]   back in the '60s when some of this early research
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.220]   or just clinical observation was done.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.380]   So it seems very clear that folks with a predisposition
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:29.580]   or active disease, they could be destabilized.
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.660]   And so some of the cases that we know of,
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:35.220]   I always think of Sid Barrett, the first singer of Pink Floyd
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:39.540]   seems pretty clear, although I think the family-
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.220]   - I don't know what happened there.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.580]   I should be, sorry, Pink Floyd fans, I've never,
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.300]   the songs are just really long.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.940]   - Yeah, you're more of a punk guy, right?
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.780]   - Yeah.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.980]   So I've got my foot in a lot of worlds,
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.420]   definitely in part in the Floyd world,
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:58.420]   but he basically went crazy early on.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:00.700]   It seemed, I don't think his family ever admitted it,
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:04.500]   but he developed schizophrenia, classic pattern.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.480]   And he was doing a lot of LSD.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.500]   But like a lot of these cases,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.300]   it looked like he was showing all of the signs
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:19.300]   of some hints that he had that susceptibility before.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:26.420]   And often this is hard to disentangle what causes what,
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.500]   because when do people typically, not always, but develop,
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.380]   when's the modal period for first break,
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:34.580]   it's adolescence, early adulthood, yeah.
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.260]   And when do people start playing with drugs?
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.780]   Same exact time period.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:43.300]   So it can be hard to disentangle, but it seems pretty clear.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.980]   Now I should also say, there are cases of folks
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.700]   with schizophrenia that say psychedelics have helped them.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.300]   There's anecdotes for everything.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.060]   - Do the people around those schizophrenics
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:52.900]   say it's helped them?
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.740]   - I don't know.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:56.340]   - 'Cause when schizophrenics say things, you have to,
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.780]   I mean, with all due compassion and respect
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:01.720]   for schizophrenia, it's a disorder of thinking.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.700]   So if they're saying it helped them.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.860]   - Yeah, can you trust them?
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.740]   I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kernel of truth
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.620]   in some cases, but they're just so,
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.860]   it seems very clear that the other side is there too,
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:17.900]   and that there ever is a therapeutic potential there
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:20.980]   for those disorders, that shouldn't be the first thing
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.140]   on our list, and we need to learn a lot more
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.340]   because of the level of risk before we start doing research
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.860]   to see if, you know, psilocybin can help with schizophrenia.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.080]   Like, I don't think that that may never be the case,
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.180]   but even if it is, you'd have to be even more cautious
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.860]   and figure some more things out first
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.540]   with some of these other disorders.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.900]   - What about bipolar, bipolar disorder?
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:44.180]   Can it be exacerbated by these compounds?
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:49.180]   - Yeah, and it may be that sort of the manifestation
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:53.100]   of people having prolonged psychiatric issues
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:58.100]   after a psychedelic experience, as atypical as that is,
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:02.080]   when that happens, it may be that might be more
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.060]   like a manic episode than a psychotic episode,
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.840]   and that can be a blurry line.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.880]   And it's, the folklore is that, you know,
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.880]   people go on a trip and they never come back.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.320]   That's clearly not the case because, you know,
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.640]   the drug is metabolized, like for anyone else,
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.160]   and the next day there's not, you know,
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.000]   there's virtually nothing in the system.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.800]   - But it reshapes circuitry, I mean.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.180]   - Right, and there's still, and I really do think, you know,
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.660]   much like the positive, you know, long-term effects that,
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.520]   you know, this class of problems is related to, like,
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   the, to the experience and the destabilization
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.040]   that can happen from that experience,
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.700]   if it's not in that, in the right container.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.920]   And again, like these people are susceptible to, you know,
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.800]   some people with that psychotic predisposition,
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.880]   they lucky to be born to a great family,
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.680]   stable environment, they maybe never have a full break,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.960]   or the one that they have is not nearly as bad as what,
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.920]   you know, someone that is, who's homeless
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.320]   and is coming from all kinds of early childhood trauma,
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.840]   like the disease is probably going to be far worse, you know?
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.640]   So, you know, having a psychedelic experience
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.080]   is like one of those destabilizing experiences, you know?
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.280]   So exclude, now, fortunately,
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.480]   it's really easy to identify those people.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.480]   And we even err on the side of extreme caution
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.200]   by eliminating people with like, say,
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.820]   a first degree relative, in some studies,
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.620]   even a second degree relative,
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.400]   given the heritability, there's some increased chance
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.520]   if your brother or your, yeah.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.580]   So in an abundance of caution, even eliminating that.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:43.160]   I think eventually, if it's approved for use, FDA use,
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.420]   we could dial back on that as we learn more.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.200]   I think it's, again, overly cautious, which is-
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.620]   - But you're doing an early stage clinical trial.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.640]   - Yeah, it's the appropriate place to start
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:53.600]   at this point in time.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.260]   But, you know, if you give a skid
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.260]   or another structured psychiatric interview
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.080]   with a clinician sitting down with this person
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.360]   for a few hours to delve into their history.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.140]   And like, you can very reliably determine
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.680]   if this person has either, you know,
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.120]   a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.120]   or a strong predisposition.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.400]   So that's, you know, that you can screen for that.
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.880]   And that's how you address that.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.800]   The far more likely danger is the bad trip.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.180]   Anyone can have this.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.960]   The most psychologically healthy person
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.720]   in the world, probably.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.080]   You jack the dose high enough.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.180]   And especially in a less than an ideal environment,
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.580]   you can have a bad trip.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:33.620]   You even get it in an ideal environment like ours
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:37.260]   at a high dose of around 30 milligrams of psilocybin.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.980]   After, you know, the best preparation we can provide,
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.060]   about a third of people will say,
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.140]   essentially at some point they have a bad trip, you know?
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:47.340]   - At some point within the entire journey.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.860]   - Right, now they could have
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.980]   one of the most beautiful experiences of their life,
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.460]   sometimes like a couple minutes later.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.160]   But at some point they had a sense of strong anxiety,
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.600]   fear, losing their mind, feeling trapped,
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.360]   something like that.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.520]   Now, typically when people have that in the, you know,
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.660]   when they're just taking on their own,
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:08.180]   like a lot of things, they're fine.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.020]   They get through it.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:11.100]   You know, they're more likely to be better off
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:14.260]   if they're not having to navigate the streets of Manhattan,
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:17.340]   that, you know, or, and if they're with, you know,
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.480]   other people with friends,
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.600]   better that those friends aren't also dealing
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.980]   with their own psychedelic experience,
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.340]   but probably having some friend of any type,
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.260]   but whatever they're on there is better than having nothing.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:30.260]   So very dependent on context.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.740]   And so the tough thing here that,
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.700]   that in conveying to the public is that
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.380]   a lot of folks will say,
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:41.060]   man, I've taken psychedelics hundreds of times,
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.460]   and this is like your fear-mongering and, you know,
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:48.300]   there's no, you know, you're exaggerating the danger there.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:52.340]   So I want to say it is atypical, but sometimes,
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:56.220]   and I have a file folder that grows larger every year
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:58.940]   of these cases, either in the medical literature
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.140]   or from the news of people that freak out on a psychedelic
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.700]   and they get hurt or they die.
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:06.460]   They run into traffic.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.020]   They fall from a height, whether they thought they could fly
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.540]   or whether they just fell like you can do when you're drunk
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:16.120]   or you're intoxicated on any substance.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.660]   Sometimes that's unclear.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.780]   Or gosh, one of the craziest cases was a kid,
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:26.460]   like an 18-year-old or so in Oregon several years back
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.420]   that just, he even wrote about,
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.300]   I want to take the biggest, he had done mushrooms before.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.360]   I want to take a heroic dose,
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.580]   the biggest dose I've ever taken.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.620]   He ended up just totally out of it,
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:37.020]   ended up in a neighbor's house.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.540]   He was just totally disoriented, disconnected from reality,
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.580]   and the cops ended up killing him.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.700]   And it was just tragic,
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.300]   obviously an overuse of force in that case,
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.780]   'cause he was actually naked at the time,
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:49.980]   this naked like 120-pound, I think,
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:52.340]   as a recalled kid that ended up dying.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.060]   - Well, it's analogous to the reason I use the examples
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.280]   of like bodybuilding culture.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.620]   I mean, people there have taken excessive amounts
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.980]   of antibiotics and diuretics and died.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.460]   Then the contortionist culture,
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.820]   people have put themselves in a little plexiglass boxes
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:09.660]   to do, at the extremes, you're going to get deaths.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.620]   And at the extremes, and one of the extremes
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.220]   is the sheer number of people
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:18.500]   with different biological makeups taking the same drug.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.340]   And so you can create extremes through numbers.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.000]   You can create extremes through dosage, right?
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.060]   It seems, well, this is why I'm such a fan of the fact
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.500]   that people like yourself are doing clinical trials
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.820]   inside the walls of universities.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:38.820]   Not because I think that psychedelics only have utility
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.600]   in those environments, but because it's so important
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.640]   toward creating their transition to legality
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:48.120]   and to understand what legality means
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.040]   for a compound like this, right?
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.000]   - What model?
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.280]   - Right, I mean, again,
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.200]   we'll stay with the anabolic steroids.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.800]   There's now testosterone and estrogen replacement therapy.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.920]   Hormone replacement therapy
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.720]   is a common medically approved practice,
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.520]   but that's vastly different than people
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.400]   taking their own stuff for diet
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.840]   or deciding how much they need to take, right?
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.480]   Like we said, there's yoga and there's contortionism
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.920]   in a plexiglass box and thinking of Houdini or something.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.880]   So these are a matter of degrees.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.680]   Speaking of dosage, I definitely want to ask you
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.880]   about microdose versus standard or macro dose.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:29.020]   Tell me that I'm wrong, but I'm always a little bit,
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:36.600]   I'm micro cynical, if you will, about this term microdose.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.560]   And the reason is that many people that I know
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:44.560]   who talk about microdosing are taking dosages of compounds
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.280]   that are very powerful at microgram levels.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.900]   So the word micro, I think,
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.500]   can be a little bit confusing to people
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.880]   because microdose implies less than something.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.640]   It's a mini dose, right?
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:04.240]   And yet some of these compounds are tremendously powerful
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.620]   at microgram concentrations.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.320]   So what it constitutes a microdose
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.220]   and what is the value of so-called microdosing, if any,
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.980]   and how does it differ from standard
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.640]   or what I can only assume is called macrodosing?
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.480]   - Yeah, and so LSD would be the prototypical example
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.200]   of that super potent compound.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:31.960]   - What size dosage of LSD will lead to hallucinations
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.780]   and kind of standard-
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:37.080]   - Sort of the entry point for psychedelic type effects,
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.760]   which may not involve hallucinations.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.800]   Actually, most classic psychedelics
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.740]   don't lead to true hallucinations
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.300]   as defined in psychiatry.
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.660]   You know, thinking you're talking to the person
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.200]   that's not there, seeing the pink elephant.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.780]   - No, it's more like tracers and things like that.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:53.880]   - Right, and some people never get that
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.160]   even at a very high dose.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.680]   So I think more broadly in terms of the psychedelic effects,
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.140]   which isn't just perceptual,
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.720]   unless we get into the level, as you were alluding to,
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.680]   earlier, a broader definition of perception,
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:09.340]   like one's models of the world, the model of the self.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.020]   You can consider all of that perception
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.280]   in terms of truly not sensation, but perception,
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.800]   the construction of putting together reality.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.560]   So yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.240]   So the psychedelic effects are typically considered
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.020]   to start for LSD around 100 micrograms.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.800]   So a 10th of a milligram is 100 micrograms.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.480]   - Right, so someone taking 100 micrograms of LSD,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.300]   nowadays, people might mistakenly refer to that
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.340]   as a microdose because it's micrograms,
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.100]   but that's actually a macrodose of LSD.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.880]   - Right, and that's one of the most common mistakes
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.240]   or situations that people get into with microdosing
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.780]   is they intend it to be a microdose,
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.120]   but it ends up being a full-blown dose.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.240]   Now, people do, when they're working with LSD
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.100]   and they're microdosing,
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:00.200]   they'll shoot for something like, say, 10.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.920]   milligrams, something in that range,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.000]   10, 20 milligrams of LSD.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.500]   So a 10th, a fifth, something of kind of
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.400]   your entry-level psychedelic dose.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.480]   People's ability on the street to do this,
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.300]   yeah, I say the street as if they're on the corner,
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.440]   but anyway, like outside of the medical profession
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.020]   to do this, it varies as you can imagine.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.900]   - And they're not measuring purity or molarity
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:24.080]   or things like that, typically.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.280]   - And there's ways to do it.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.200]   So even if you don't ultimately know the dose
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.920]   that's in the blot or paper of acid,
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.520]   one could at least get a sense of like,
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.440]   yeah, having one of those tabs is,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.240]   one of those hits is a psychedelic experience.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.240]   They could do something like put it in water,
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.560]   it's 100% aqueous soluble.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.520]   You could make sure it all gets into solution
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.100]   and then volumetrically measure.
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.200]   It's gonna be homogeneously distributed.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.040]   So you can take 1/10 of that volume of water
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.820]   after it's fully dissolved.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:54.040]   That whatever you started with,
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.280]   you're gonna have a 10th of that dose.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.360]   So the people that are more sophisticated
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.680]   will do things like that.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.440]   And when they're working with mushrooms,
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.500]   they'll grow a bunch of mushrooms
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.720]   and then they'll say, put it in a coffee grinder.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.660]   I'm not telling people to do this, by the way,
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.600]   I'm just describing, so don't do this at home,
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:10.040]   but like grind it all up so it's homogenous.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.520]   'Cause you can have like,
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.680]   sort of taking two caps and a stem,
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.300]   hey, this two caps and a stem that this buddy takes
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:20.740]   has a different potency than this two caps and a stem
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:21.800]   that the other buddy takes.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.240]   So people that are kind of in the know
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.800]   will grind it all up into a homogenous powder
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.120]   and they'll pack it into whatever size capsule
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.000]   and they'll know that.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.800]   And again, even if they don't have,
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.920]   sometimes they might have a buddy
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.360]   that'll sneak it into the HPLC at their job or whatever,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.760]   if they have-- - Not your lab.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.200]   - Not my lab, that's never happened.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.440]   Yeah, seriously, never happened.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.320]   But they'll at least know that,
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:46.700]   hey, I've got a sense of what two capsules do.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:49.320]   I've got a sense of what five capsules do.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.960]   But in reality, like that's not what people do.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.500]   They'll take a piece of blotter paper
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.260]   and they get a tiny little pair of scissors,
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.820]   a Swiss army knife pair of scissors,
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:02.060]   and they'll cut up the tab of acid,
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:05.220]   which is like, you know, a quarter inch square or something.
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.420]   And they'll cut it up in 10 little pieces.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:09.460]   And it's like, you have no idea
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.160]   like if it's equally distributed in that media.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.840]   - Yeah, and we can chuckle about it.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.840]   And, but to me, one of the reasons why this experiment
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.160]   around psychedelics, this cultural experiment
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:25.420]   and this legal experiment, we're seeing this now,
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:29.860]   but this was all attempted once before in the 60s and 70s.
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:32.560]   The difference was it was all out in the street.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:35.920]   The people in universities who were dabbling with this stuff
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.680]   lost, most of them lost their jobs
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.160]   or were asked to leave through, you know.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.240]   - They lost their funding for this research minimally
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.600]   and they had to move on to other topics.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.720]   - That's right, so these are precarious times.
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.520]   I mean, we're at a key moment where everyone assumes
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.700]   that this is all going to be legal in a few years.
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.360]   But I think that that's a premature assumption.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.260]   - Yeah. - Frankly.
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:44:00.780]   But, and let's touch on the legality
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:02.540]   and some of the things that are happening now.
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.540]   But what is microdosing psilocybin
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:09.980]   versus the sorts of dosages that you described before
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:12.560]   in the 10 to 40 milligram range?
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.820]   I've heard of people taking one or two milligrams
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.360]   of psilocybin every day as a way to quote unquote,
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.200]   and for those listening, I'm just making air quotes
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.340]   with my fingers, increase plasticity,
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.740]   which is a term that I personally loathe
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.140]   because what does that mean?
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.400]   I mean, you don't really want your brain to be plastic
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.520]   because you need to make,
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.900]   you need to maintain your ability to make predictions.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:36.700]   Yeah, I mean, plasticity- - Ordering chaos,
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:40.080]   like prediction, you need models of the world.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.240]   You need heuristics, like.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.400]   - Plasticity is never the goal,
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.660]   or plasticity is never the goal.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.940]   The goal-directed plasticity is the goal, right?
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:53.140]   Learning a language, reshaping your experience to a trauma,
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.820]   altering the perception of self,
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:58.340]   but plasticity is a process, like-
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.260]   - Yeah, schizophrenia is a lot of plasticity.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.620]   - Exactly, right, right, and it might even be,
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:06.420]   there's one theory that it's extreme ongoing plasticity
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.100]   and that's why people never create
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.020]   stable representations of anything.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:13.640]   That's a kind of a minority view out there,
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.100]   but so what's the business with microdosing
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.140]   and is there any clinical evidence
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:21.780]   or peer-reviewed published evidence that it works,
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.860]   quote, unquote, to make people feel better about anything?
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:29.860]   - So microdosing is the aim of taking,
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:33.700]   again, something around a 10th of what would be
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.700]   sort of an entry-level psychedelic dose
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:39.540]   for whatever compound, so like, yeah, with psilocybin,
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.020]   usually people, almost never do people have
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:44.860]   like pure psilocybin, like one milligram of psilocybin
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.140]   would be in the range of a microdose.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.320]   More likely, people are going to have mushrooms,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:53.200]   so like something like a half of a gram of mushroom.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.500]   - I know people that are doing this every day.
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.300]   They're doing this every day, it's like in their,
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:00.560]   like the same way that I take, like I'm personally,
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.120]   I'm not recommending other people do this,
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:05.320]   but I take some, I'm a fan of LCL carnitine lately.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.000]   I've been kind of experimenting with that a little bit,
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.880]   which is not a psychedelic compound.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:12.160]   I take it every day and they're taking their psilocybin
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.440]   every day, that's their supplement, so.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:19.180]   - So yeah, the claims are, and there are a number of them,
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.500]   there's two general ones.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:25.500]   One is sort of acting in place of the ADHD treating drugs,
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.160]   so the psychomotor stimulant,
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.700]   so like a better version of Adderall.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:32.700]   The other claims are essentially a better version
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:35.840]   of the traditional antidepressants,
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.640]   a better version of Prozac.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.860]   - So people are taking both for attention deficit
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.800]   and for depression.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.940]   - Yeah, and the aspects of those disorders
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:48.080]   that we all have a degree of,
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.000]   just like amphetamine is gonna increase the focus
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.440]   at the right dose of anyone who takes amphetamine
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.860]   pretty much, whether you're ADHD diagnosed or not,
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.600]   the idea is that there may not be necessarily
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.880]   a clear divide between the therapeutic need
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.880]   and positive psychology, even improving mood and focus,
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.020]   so it's not necessarily correcting ADHD,
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:19.180]   but improving focus to supercharge your life.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.660]   And so those are the claims.
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:25.660]   So none of the peer-reviewed studies
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:28.400]   that have much credibility,
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:33.260]   none of them have shown a benefit and they've tried.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.580]   Now there's only at this point four or five studies that,
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:39.020]   and I think for things like this,
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:43.200]   you really need double-blind research 'cause the effects,
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.340]   I mean, there was one study done in Amsterdam
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.140]   where people knew they were taking psilocybin truffles,
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.200]   basically same as mushrooms,
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.840]   they're more like the roots of the mycelia.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.120]   - Microdosing them.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.940]   - Well, taking what would be considered a microdose
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:01.200]   and then doing some cognitive measures before and after.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.340]   And the types of things that,
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.200]   like a lot of cognitive measures are measured
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.820]   on the order of reaction time in milliseconds.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:08.800]   I mean, and the types of effects you get
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.060]   as you could imagine are ones that like would be,
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.720]   you would totally expect could be there
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.420]   from either a practice effect or an expectancy effect,
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.480]   a placebo effect.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.700]   So for something like these claimed,
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.760]   you can imagine a sort of an increased focus,
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.440]   enhancement of cognition.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.000]   These are like gonna be more subtle effects
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.640]   that you really need a good placebo control for.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.680]   The handful of studies that have done that have shown,
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:43.120]   they've ranged from finding no effect whatsoever
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.900]   to just a little bit of impairment,
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.840]   like impairing someone's ability
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.920]   to do time estimation and production tasks.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:52.460]   So you want an accurate sense of time,
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.800]   at least if you're navigating in the real world.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.600]   It's different if you're on the couch on a heroic dose
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.340]   for therapeutic reasons where you're safe,
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.960]   but if you're crossing the street,
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.840]   if you're getting in your work life,
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.680]   which is the way people are claiming to use it,
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.720]   it helps them be a better CEO,
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.520]   like you want an accurate sense of time.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.120]   So if anything, the data suggests
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.760]   that it makes it a little bit less accurate.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.000]   And there's evidence that someone feels a little bit
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.520]   impaired and they feel a little bit high.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.360]   So in terms of, you call that abuse liability in research,
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.880]   not surprising, you take a little bit of a drug
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.280]   that can result in some type of a high
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.460]   and you take a little tiny bit of it,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.400]   you'll feel a little bit high.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.800]   So none of the, so far,
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.800]   no studies have shown any increase in creativity,
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.120]   enhancement of any form of cognition
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.620]   or a sustained improvement in mood.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:53.840]   Now, no studies have actually looked
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.800]   at the system of microdosing
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.840]   that the aficionados are claiming.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.000]   And there's a couple of models out there,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.420]   but folks like Paul Stamets and others,
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.880]   they'll have particular formulas.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.000]   They're like, you need to take it one day
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.780]   and then take so many days off and take it every four days.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.700]   And I don't want to get into whose model is what,
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.960]   but it's always something like that,
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.580]   some pattern of use, usually not every day.
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.740]   And the claim is that it's not just,
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.920]   sometimes people get benefit that first time
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.040]   when they take it,
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.920]   but they really say you need to be on it for a while.
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:29.760]   Like a few weeks in, you may start to notice
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.600]   through this pattern of using it.
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.440]   And you're feeling the benefits on those off days,
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:40.440]   like the three or two days in between your active doses.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.560]   So those are the claims.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.180]   Again, we don't know that there's any truth to that working,
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:47.800]   but studies have not been done to model that.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.300]   So that's a big caveat.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:53.440]   We as a field, I say we as the scientific field,
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.400]   have not done the studies to really model
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.840]   what the real aficionados are claiming,
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:03.720]   where the therapeutic benefits come from.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.480]   That said, it's almost assuredly
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.440]   there's a good amount of placebo there.
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.600]   But the caveat to that is like almost everything
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.480]   in medicine or therapeutics,
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:16.360]   there's, it's going to have some degree of placebo there.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.920]   - Belief effects are, I have a colleague at Stanford,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.380]   Alia Crum, who has published really beautiful work
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:26.600]   on belief effects that show that essentially
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.480]   you give the same milkshake to two people,
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.360]   you, or two groups of people,
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.840]   you tell them that one contains a lot of nutrients,
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.100]   the other is a low calorie shake.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.080]   The insulin response.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:37.040]   - Amazing.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.120]   - Varies dramatically between the two,
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:42.380]   or two groups rather doing equivalent amounts
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:45.040]   of physical movement.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.940]   And you tell one group that it's going to be good for them
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.840]   and help them lose weight.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:50.080]   And they lose on average eight to 12 pounds more
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.200]   doing the exact same patterns of movement.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.440]   So, and I think that these belief effects boil down
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.560]   to all sorts of kind of network-wide neuromodulation,
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.400]   things of that sort.
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.040]   - And then the work at Harvard suggesting
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.160]   that even if you don't have deception,
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.600]   you give a placebo and say, this is a sugar pill.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.440]   - Right.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.000]   - You know, tell them that.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.180]   And they could still treat things.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.720]   I think irritable bowel was the first thing they looked at.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:12.560]   - Right.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.920]   - And so there's a huge, so there's a reality there.
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.960]   - Right.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.520]   - There's a necessity in developing drugs
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.080]   to make sure it's not only that,
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.720]   but in the actual practice of medicine,
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.080]   hopefully what you're always getting
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.800]   is some underlying direct efficacy plus the placebo
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:27.920]   that it enhances at.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:31.360]   Now, it could be that this is, the real question is,
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.520]   is the microdosing, are those claims 100% placebo
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.480]   or are they only part placebo and part real,
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.240]   you know, quote unquote effect.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.080]   My bet is, and this is totally based on anecdotes
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.720]   that I think there is probably a reality
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.320]   to the antidepressant effects.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:50.880]   I find that more intriguing
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:53.160]   because of the suffering with depression.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.000]   - Right.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.200]   - Even if it's, it wouldn't be as interesting
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:59.160]   as I think what we're doing with high dose psilocybin
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.760]   or psychedelics to treat depression.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.260]   It would be, if this is developed and there's a reality,
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.800]   it would be more like a better, you know,
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.080]   perhaps a better SSRI, a better Prozac.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:10.920]   - Which are similar.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:11.760]   - That being said, we need more tools
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.080]   than fewer tools in the toolbox.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.860]   And it shouldn't be that surprise.
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:19.400]   Like even before the, going back to the tricyclics
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.080]   and the MAO inhibitors going back to the fifties,
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.320]   like augmenting extracellular serotonin
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.960]   in one way or another, for many people,
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:31.320]   leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:34.560]   It wouldn't be that crazy for chronically stimulating
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.980]   a subtype of serotonin receptor
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.800]   that you have an antidepressant effect.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.260]   So I think if I had put my bets on it,
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:42.880]   that there's, if there's anything real,
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.440]   it is in that category.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.560]   Although I'm very open to like,
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.120]   maybe there is something to the creativity,
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.960]   to the, you know, improved cognition,
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.860]   which covers many domains in and of itself.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:58.860]   But my greatest hopes are on the antidepressant effects.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:02.120]   That said, in the big picture,
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.160]   I think all of the most interesting thing
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.560]   about psychedelics are the heroic doses.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.240]   I mean, the idea that you can give something
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:09.520]   one, two, three times,
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:12.840]   and you see improvements in depression months later
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:16.280]   and in addiction, you know, over a year later.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.120]   And with these people dealing
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:20.080]   with potentially terminal illness,
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:23.820]   I mean, I'm interested in big effects.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:25.120]   And I don't think you're ever going to get
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.600]   the really big effects.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.640]   There's also some concern
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.000]   that almost all of these common psych,
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.020]   the more common psychedelics, even counting MDMA,
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:37.280]   they have serotonin 2B agonist effects.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.120]   And agonizing serotonin 2B has been shown
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:47.120]   to lead to heart valve formation problems,
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.600]   morphology issues, so valvulopathy.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.480]   And so this is why Fen-Phen was pulled from the market.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.580]   - The diet drug.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:55.420]   - Yes.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:56.240]   - Very effective diet drug.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.080]   - Right, right.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.720]   And it was the portion of that combination
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.720]   that had the serotonin 2B activity that was the problem.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.200]   And so we don't know.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.960]   So all of the toxicologists I've ever spoken to about this
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.560]   would say, and cardiologists say like, look, hey,
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:16.360]   if there was some concern there,
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360]   it's not applicable to the whole idea
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.920]   of you taking something a few times therapeutically
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.900]   within a lifetime.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:26.900]   But the idea of taking something like twice a week for years,
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:31.220]   I mean, even the hippies back in the '60s
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.380]   weren't doing that, right?
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:33.840]   Like there's not even these natural,
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:38.840]   and even if there was some heart valve disease problem
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.680]   that stemmed from psychedelic use,
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.320]   who's connecting those dots?
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.300]   That's not showing up in the clinical charts
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.260]   for anyone to figure out.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.760]   So there is, and just theoretically,
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.960]   there is more of a concern.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.220]   If something's going to happen with heart valves,
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:58.900]   it's more likely that those issues would arise
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:00.520]   when someone's taking these things like, yeah,
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.200]   let's say twice a week for the next five years.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.920]   And so I do want to throw that out to people
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.040]   to really consider.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.720]   - Right, yeah, it's something I hadn't heard before
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.000]   that in micro sounds safer, micro dosing
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.240]   as opposed to heroic or macro dosing.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.120]   And yet, unless, and in the context of your lab
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:20.960]   and other labs doing similar work,
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:23.360]   you've got this people checking blood pressure,
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.040]   you've got people that are really monitoring
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:27.280]   your psychological and physical safety.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.840]   When people are out there micro dosing,
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.880]   it sounds like there's the potential
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.400]   either through this serotonin 5-HT-2B receptor
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.540]   or other mechanism that maybe there could be
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:40.080]   some kind of cumulative negative effects.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.340]   And I think that's a really important consideration.
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.240]   So I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.540]   What about kids?
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:50.700]   So the brain is very plastic early in life.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:53.440]   It becomes less plastic as we age,
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.120]   although it maintains some degree of plasticity
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.640]   throughout the lifespan.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.640]   The year 25, not the year 25, but rather the age 25 years
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.200]   is sort of an inflection point where the rigidity
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.620]   of the nervous system seems to really take off.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:14.060]   Of course, people don't wake up on their 25th birthday
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.300]   and find they have no neuroplasticity,
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.760]   whereas the day before they had a lot.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.620]   These are, it's plus or minus, whatever it is, a year or two,
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.700]   but depends on the individual.
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:29.740]   However, the young brain is very plastic
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.660]   and I could imagine there could be great risks.
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:37.420]   Who knows, maybe even benefits,
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:40.040]   but I'm certainly not thinking about those.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.620]   I'm mainly thinking about the risks
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:46.220]   for young people taking psychedelics.
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.960]   Are there any trials looking at people in clinical trials
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.300]   this would be under the age of 18?
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:54.420]   Has anyone explored this in a rigorous way,
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:57.660]   given the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:59.500]   and bipolar symptoms in some people?
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.320]   Is there a heightened risk of that?
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:06.340]   What's the story with age of use in psychedelics
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.540]   for therapeutic purposes?
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.060]   - There's no formal research,
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:13.080]   although there's a very high chance that there will be.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.820]   And so this is one of the very interesting things
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.420]   folks may not realize or appreciate
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:19.600]   about the FDA approval process.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.260]   So the FDA already in multiple instances has signaled
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.900]   that they want to see those studies.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.860]   - Before?
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:29.940]   - Well, not before it's approved as necessarily
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:34.340]   as for adults, but they're going to eventually want to see
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:38.260]   in fact, so the MAPS group that's developing MDMA for PTSD,
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.460]   they've already signaled
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:44.900]   that that's kind of on the list of interest.
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:49.900]   And there's even some incentives in the FDA pathways
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:55.060]   for incentivizing folks to explore that use in young people.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:57.840]   I know in some of the work that I helped with
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:02.840]   in pushing psilocybin into phase 2B clinical research,
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:09.580]   the FDA said, "Well, why can't you give this to kids?"
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:13.400]   It's like, are you aware that depression is a problem
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.400]   with adolescents?
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.340]   And it's really interesting
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.100]   because this FDA is very concerned about pseudospecificity.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:24.860]   - Where do you define pseudospecificity?
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:25.980]   - You put out a drug and say,
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:28.860]   "Oh, this is good for men, but not women.
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:31.620]   This is good for black folks, but not white folks."
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:34.680]   And now sometimes there's a very good rationale for that.
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:36.740]   Like when we're talking about hormones
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:40.500]   and for a specific, for men versus women,
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.700]   and there's certain issues,
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:47.800]   certain disease states like maybe sickle cell anemia
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:48.640]   that's more relevant.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:49.480]   - Taste hacks, things like that.
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:51.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.940]   But absent of something that they're very concerned
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.740]   about saying, "Oh, this is for this type of person,
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:57.980]   but not that type of person."
[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:59.580]   So age is one of those things.
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:01.880]   And also this recognition,
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:06.380]   much like the emphasis at NIH with rodent studies
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.300]   and human studies that like,
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.800]   you can't just say you're studying men
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:11.720]   or just you need a rationale if you're only-
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:15.340]   - Yeah, to be clear to people, it's a recent switch,
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:19.820]   but there's a stipulation in every federally funded grant
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:22.820]   that both sexes, we don't refer to gender
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:26.460]   in scientific studies, unless it's a study of gender per se,
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.880]   we refer to sex, meaning biological sex.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.180]   So that there's a stipulation that in order to receive
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:33.460]   and continue to receive funding,
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:37.680]   you have to do studies on both males and females
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.860]   of that species, including humans.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.020]   - And at least even if you're not powered for it,
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:44.660]   at least looking at that in exploratory analysis,
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:48.260]   like as a grant reviewer, I'm charged with looking at,
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:49.720]   did they address like sex
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.780]   as a biologically relevant variable?
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:55.420]   - Right, does the same drug have different effects
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:56.740]   in males versus females?
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:58.700]   - Right, and you can at least look at the trends,
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:00.100]   even again, if you're under power
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.940]   to look at those between subject type effects.
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:07.120]   - Which is a great shift that didn't exist in 10 years ago.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.500]   Sounds like we're both on grants panels.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.500]   As study section members, you didn't have to do that.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.580]   Now it's an important biological variable.
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:16.180]   If you don't look at that,
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:18.600]   you essentially won't get your funding.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.960]   - And age is a similar thing.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.180]   So it's the whole idea like,
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:23.960]   man, if something could help kids, like what's the rationale?
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:24.960]   So I think there's going to be,
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.420]   now obviously you're going to have in those studies,
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:31.020]   at least just as much, probably more,
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:34.740]   it should be more of a cautionary approach.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:36.040]   It's probably going to be,
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:39.260]   would certainly whatever disease states are looked at
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.340]   are going to have to be probably treatment resistant,
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:42.620]   at least as a first step.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:44.080]   - Suicidal depression.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.660]   - Yeah, yeah, and so all of that in the mix,
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:50.660]   but hey, if this stuff really helps people,
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.500]   that are 25 or 30,
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:57.980]   what's the rationale that it won't help a younger person?
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.100]   And there's these generic kind of concerns
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.720]   about the developing nervous system
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.300]   is more susceptible to problem.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:06.460]   I mean, it cuts both ways,
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:10.060]   'cause it's also more plastic generally and adaptable,
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:12.700]   maybe resilient to injury in certain ways.
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:16.280]   But you hear the rhetoric about kids, their brains and drugs
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.460]   and it's like the developing brain is a special concern.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:22.140]   So yeah, but I think we're going to be
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:23.800]   seeing research eventually.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.720]   - That's interesting.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.320]   I went to the high school that is infamous,
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:33.340]   sadly, Gunn High School, for having the highest degree,
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:36.080]   at least at one point, of suicide rate.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:36.920]   - Wow.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.020]   - And a very large number of suicides.
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.440]   This was written up in the Times and elsewhere.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.020]   - Is it a very academically successful school?
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:44.860]   - It's a very academically- - So there's a lot
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:46.960]   of high pressure, kinda, yeah. - Yeah, very academically
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.220]   demanding school to the point where they've restricted,
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:53.040]   the kids will meet often at 6.30 a.m.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:55.200]   or 6 a.m. before school for study groups
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.400]   and things of that sort.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.640]   So some of it may relate to that.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:00.160]   But I have to say that even prior
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:03.240]   to all that academic pressure,
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:06.680]   when I went there, the pressure wasn't like that.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.660]   You know, we had an unusual number of suicides
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:11.800]   for whatever reason.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:16.800]   And so the idea of kids being prescribed
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:19.340]   and I want to emphasize prescribed, not just using,
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:22.120]   but prescribed psychedelics for therapeutic purposes,
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.580]   I think might make some people bulk,
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:29.460]   but the idea of kids killing themselves
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.780]   should also make people bulk.
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:34.180]   And so I'm relieved to hear that there's going to be
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:37.380]   a rational, scientific, safe,
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:40.020]   clinical trial-based exploration of this.
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:45.380]   I want to ask you about the current status
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.000]   of these drugs and compounds.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.280]   I'm pretty active on social media,
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.280]   more so on Instagram than on Twitter.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:57.280]   But as I have been on Twitter a little bit more recently,
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.700]   I've noticed that there's a lot of dialogue
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:02.560]   around your account and other people's accounts
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.760]   around a couple of themes related to psychedelics.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:08.440]   First of all, what is the status of the transition
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:11.960]   to legality for prescription purposes?
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.940]   So medical doctors, MDs prescribing it legally
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:17.960]   for therapeutic purposes.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.040]   That's the first question.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:22.080]   The second question is what is the status
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:25.560]   as it relates to possession and criminal charges?
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:28.720]   So for a long time, I lived in Oakland
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.060]   where we were one day told not too long ago,
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:35.200]   it is now quote unquote decriminalized is what I was told.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.840]   I double checked people, but what does that mean?
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.760]   And then the other issue and the third question,
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:43.480]   and we can parse these one by one,
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:46.980]   is this issue of let's just say I'm aware
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:50.360]   of a lot of investor dollars going into companies
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:55.360]   that are essentially companies focused on psychedelics
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.800]   as therapeutics or psychedelics generally.
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:01.040]   I have to assume that they are investing
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.100]   in anticipation of a shift in the legal status.
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:07.640]   And there's a lot of interest now,
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.480]   like will psilocybin become a taxable thing
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.400]   just like marijuana?
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.360]   So let's start with the question of like,
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:18.080]   what is going on in the US legally?
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   Is it illegal to possess and sell and use these compounds?
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:26.520]   My understanding is you can still go to jail
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:30.280]   for having these compounds in your possession
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:31.120]   or for selling.
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:35.580]   - Right, so even though the legal landscape
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.280]   is very different than with cannabis,
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.700]   there are some similarities.
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:42.080]   So one of the similarities is that regardless
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:45.800]   of what local municipal, whether city or state
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.420]   has decriminalized, and that word itself
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:50.580]   can mean many things.
[02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:54.240]   So some forms of decriminalization is close
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:56.820]   to what folks would call legalization
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:59.720]   and others are like pretty weak, just saying,
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:02.040]   we suggest that the police make
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.860]   it their lowest law enforcement priority,
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:04.700]   that type of thing.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:06.400]   - Turn the other cheek kind of thing.
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.200]   - Right, but even the cops can still choose to.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.740]   - But someone could get pulled over for one thing,
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:13.720]   searched and then by definition,
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.320]   if it's illegal and they find it,
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.960]   then they have to do something about it.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:19.560]   - And that'll probably be determined
[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:23.600]   by both judicial precedent, is it going to be thrown out
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.440]   and just the local prosecutor, even before,
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.560]   like are they going to choose even at post arrest
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:31.940]   are going to pursue to really go after those charges,
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.700]   make those charges stick.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:34.920]   So I think that's still in play
[02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.420]   and it's going to depend on the municipality,
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:38.960]   but like cannabis, federally,
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.640]   these are all schedule one compounds.
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:41.840]   - Which means they're illegal.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.880]   - Which means they're illegal.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.140]   The caveat to that, just as has always been the case
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:49.360]   since Prop 215 in California with cannabis in '96,
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:54.160]   is that, hey, 99% of drug enforcement
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.720]   is done at the local and state level.
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:59.600]   The DEA, which is the federal level of law enforcement
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.480]   is a tiny fraction of the arrests.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:04.860]   They got, I mean, most people that arrested for any drug
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:09.860]   are done by local or state level authorities,
[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:13.180]   but it's still technically illegal.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:15.980]   And so you can, and they could potentially,
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.420]   and depending on the ambiguity of the local law,
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:20.140]   even those local officials could charge you
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.800]   with a federal crime.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:27.100]   And theoretically, the feds could always come in.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:30.980]   Now, although you'll, again, a similar case
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:33.380]   with the whole cannabis history,
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:36.960]   it was the, the feds came in in the early days,
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.840]   but the folks that were basically highly visible,
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.620]   they went after Tommy Chong for selling bongs.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:45.400]   But I remember him being on "The Tonight Show" one time,
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.320]   and I think it was back in the Jay Leno days,
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:50.220]   he says, "But oh, along the Santa Monica boardwalk,
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:51.580]   like every shop sells bongs.
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:53.720]   How did you go to prison for a half year for bongs?"
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.220]   It's 'cause he was, and there-
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:56.060]   - 'Cause he was famous.
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.820]   - 'Cause he was, you know, Tommy Chong.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:02.340]   And there were some high profile cannabis groups
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:04.500]   that were distributing it and they were very vocal.
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.900]   Those were the ones raided by the DEA in the early days,
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.920]   not the ones kind of keeping to themselves,
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.540]   keeping it quiet and just doing their thing.
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:14.600]   So there's always the potential for selective enforcement.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.260]   And so, you know, in like this initiative in Oregon,
[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:22.260]   which is a state level legalization of psilocybin therapy,
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:24.140]   which is really interesting, you know,
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:26.620]   part of their plan for two years is to figure out
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:30.300]   how to integrate with the federal level.
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.100]   And I don't know how that's gonna go
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:34.420]   because like, unless you rewrite
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.020]   the Controlled Substances Act,
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.460]   it seems like the best you're gonna get
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:40.900]   is a tolerance from the federal government.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.580]   And you know, and that could be very, you know,
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.020]   hey, you change administrations.
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:51.020]   - And this is psilocybin by a prescription
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:54.460]   from a medical doctor, or you're talking about therapists
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:58.780]   who have master's degrees or PhDs
[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:01.980]   or self-appointed coaches or something like that.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:06.740]   Administering psilocybin, but without any oversight.
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.500]   - So this is all getting figured out in the Oregon case.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.480]   And again, there's that two year period of like,
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.100]   basically we're gonna figure this out.
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.780]   And so-- - What is it with Oregon?
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:18.220]   - They're ahead with a lot of, you know, euthanasia.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:19.580]   - I love the state of Oregon.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:22.520]   But it's interesting how you have these pockets.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.720]   Oregon, Vermont seems to be one.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.560]   You know, you've got these kind of pockets
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.720]   where people are experimental with plant compounds.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.320]   They seem to be green, woodsy areas, at least in my mind.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.120]   But there's sort of a culture around plants
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.240]   and the use of plants as therapeutics.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:41.040]   - And combine that with the West,
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:46.040]   just more geographically of more of the anti-federalism,
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.580]   the anti, I mean, the Oregon ranchers from several years ago
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:53.820]   that held up the, you know, the whatever wildlife place,
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:55.780]   you know, and that was a big showdown with the feds,
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:59.040]   you know, and the, you know, just kind of the West
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:02.280]   is kind of known for, you know, more of those issues.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:03.500]   So you combine the two,
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.720]   the hippie-dippie California-Oregon vibe
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:06.560]   with the kind of anti-- - Yeah, although I wouldn't
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:09.920]   think it's becoming less hippie-dippie than,
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.160]   although it was, there's always been a tradition,
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.440]   not just in the culture around drugs,
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:18.400]   but certainly in academia and in tech, et cetera,
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.720]   that the West has been a place where people have tried
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.280]   to throw off traditionalism and kind of lineage
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.240]   and like who your parents are, what school you went to,
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.000]   and the past as a determinant of what's next
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.720]   and exciting about the future.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:39.680]   Whereas, and here we are an East Coast institution guy
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:41.320]   and a West Coast institution guy,
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:46.120]   I think that it's this idea of kind of innovation
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:49.120]   and the future versus do we stay grounded
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.600]   in history and tradition? - Right.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.860]   - And of course there are great institutions on both sides.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:57.620]   What's interesting is that Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:02.020]   School, I think of as a real East Coast academic institution,
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:07.020]   it is on the East Coast, but here you are doing these very
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:12.300]   pioneering and important and exploratory studies
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:14.960]   in a, certainly not a hippie-dippie environment.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.000]   - Right, oh yeah, very conservative psychiatry department,
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.580]   even amongst psychiatry departments.
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:21.940]   And as a psychologist in the psychiatry department,
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.160]   psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology,
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.640]   even within academics, but even amongst psychiatry
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:30.700]   departments, it's a very conservative department.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:32.960]   - So we've got the law at the federal level,
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.800]   we've got the law at the state and local level,
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:38.240]   and then we've got this question of whether or not
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:43.240]   it's going to be physicians, so MDs, people with PhDs
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:45.140]   or master's degrees, or whether or not it will be
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:48.760]   kind of a free-for-all for consumption.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.560]   - The life coaches. - The life coaches
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.600]   and the general public, I mean, cannabis,
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.640]   I'm not a pot smoker, it's never appealed to me,
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:02.640]   that's just me and my pharmacology, but you can buy cannabis
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:08.840]   most places in the US without a ton of risk, it seems, right?
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.980]   Are we going to see a time in which you can essentially
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:18.400]   go into a shop on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice,
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:21.580]   California, and right now you can go buy marijuana
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:24.200]   if you have a marijuana carta, that's my understanding.
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.100]   I see a lot of people going in and out of these stores.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.840]   The police certainly have no problem with it.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.360]   Is there going to come a time where people
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.680]   can just go buy psilocybin?
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:34.280]   Do you think- - Like they do in Amsterdam
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:35.120]   and have for a long time. - Do you think
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.260]   that time is coming?
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:42.920]   - I think so, at a certain point,
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:46.500]   and I don't know how long.
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:51.500]   It's hard to imagine our current level
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:57.080]   of drug criminalization holding up for,
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:58.940]   and I'm thinking like large spans of time,
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:00.360]   like really in a hundred years,
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.200]   are we going to be doing this 500 years?
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:04.580]   Like how could that, it's not going to be sustainable.
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.140]   - But in five years, for instance.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.720]   - So I don't think so in the United States.
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.280]   I do think eventually you're going to see something
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.080]   like that 'cause there's going to be no way,
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.640]   and I think we're going to,
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.420]   I hope that we're going to eventually come so strongly,
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:25.500]   we're going to move on from this model of criminalizing drugs
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:28.140]   that we're really going to focus on regulating drugs
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.580]   at the right level for that drug.
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:33.260]   And I like the word regulation better than legalization.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:36.660]   So, I mean, I could imagine what one day regulation,
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:38.960]   smart regulation might mean for psychedelics.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:41.620]   Maybe it could mean that there will be,
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:44.760]   whether or not you have a diagnosis of a problem,
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.980]   it may be that even for personal exploration,
[02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:48.560]   you can do this legally,
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:51.380]   but you first have to maybe take a court, get a drive,
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:52.940]   and this has been, I'm not the first to say this,
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.160]   but get equivalent of a driver's license.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.000]   You have to go to get some sort of training.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.660]   Maybe your first number of experiences
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:05.020]   need to be with trained guides who can facilitate it.
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.060]   And then the public health information for anyone using this
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:10.720]   that this is what riskier use is.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:12.000]   All use is going to have risk.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.240]   This is what riskier use is.
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.660]   This is less risky use.
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:16.160]   These are the factors.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.060]   So I think eventually we're going to be getting for any,
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.240]   but I would say the same thing
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:23.920]   for like methamphetamine and heroin and cocaine,
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:24.760]   like all of these drugs,
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:27.080]   it's hard to imagine the current approach
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:29.520]   of just feeding a black market
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:32.840]   and really exacerbating a lot of the harms from drugs.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.400]   You know, that happens under the current model.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:38.080]   It's hard to imagine that maintaining.
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:40.720]   That isn't to say, I think it should be
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.520]   in all of the 7-Elevens, you know,
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:45.700]   sold to kids at the other extreme,
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:48.180]   but I do think it's probably not going to be soon
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.060]   in the United States.
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:51.660]   I do want to make the major point
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:55.300]   that even if psychedelics had never been made illegal,
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:59.000]   I think the trajectory of the medical research right now
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.700]   would still need to happen.
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:03.860]   If it's effective as an antidepressant,
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:06.860]   like we need it to be, you know,
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.780]   there's all the evidence suggesting
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.500]   that whatever disorder we're talking about,
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.180]   the efficacy is going to be increased
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:15.980]   and the risks are going to be mitigated drastically
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:18.080]   in the types of models we're talking about
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.460]   with the screening, with the preparation,
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.700]   with the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:23.540]   or what have you,
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:25.420]   depending on the disorder you're treating,
[02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:28.500]   with the integration afterwards with the professionals.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.580]   So we would be doing it anyway.
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:34.360]   So it's not like this versus that.
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:37.060]   So I don't see it as a race between the decriminalization
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:38.840]   or legalization of these compounds
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:40.360]   versus their medical development.
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:42.120]   Some people who are psychedelic fans
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:47.400]   get all into a bunch about the medical development.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.200]   They say, you guys want to like,
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.960]   you want to keep it only for, you know,
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.040]   for your medical research and I retire
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.400]   and you want to be in control of it as academics.
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:00.840]   And my take is I didn't make it illegal for anyone.
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.380]   We're only moving the needle in one direction.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:05.680]   And again, even if it was already illegal,
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.200]   and I've done plenty of survey research of people reporting,
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.240]   they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration.
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:14.840]   And they said, my God, why am I smoking?
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.760]   And they quit smoking 20 years because of it,
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:18.300]   or it's helped with their depression
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.340]   or it's helped with them overcoming alcoholism
[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:22.960]   or these different, sometimes that happens out of the blue
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.640]   when people use psychedelics.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.720]   Nonetheless, obviously the efficacy rates
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:29.260]   are going to be higher when you bring it
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:31.860]   into these medical models and it's going to be safer.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:34.880]   So we're going to, you know, so we need to be pushing that.
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.300]   And my best guess is that MDMA is going to be approved
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.820]   within the next three years.
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.040]   - And for prescription by a physician.
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:44.480]   - Yes, in, and not just, you know,
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:46.160]   take two and call me in the morning,
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.200]   but in the clinics,
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:50.080]   the way that those PTSD trials are being run.
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.800]   So the MDMA would be approved for PTSD
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:55.100]   and every disorder needs to be looked at separately.
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:56.900]   And it's going to only be approved for those things.
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:58.740]   Now there's going to be questions about-
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:00.340]   - Right, because approved and legalized and regulated,
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:02.600]   or, you know, now we're getting into the nuance.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:04.400]   I think when people hear it's going to be approved
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.540]   in two years, they think that they'll be able to buy
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:10.000]   and sell and use MDMA without legal consequences.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.480]   And I do not think that's going to be the situation.
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:13.480]   It's not the way it is.
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.300]   And I will say that I think the quote unquote
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.120]   psychedelic community, I mean,
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:21.840]   they've been doing what they want to
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:25.840]   and will carry on doing what they want to anyway, right?
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.160]   It's not like the legal status has prevented them
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.800]   from doing what they're doing.
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.800]   In fact, unlike Leary and Timothy Leary and Huxley
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:38.720]   and some of the others that were very vocal
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:41.900]   and lost their jobs and some who even went to jail, et cetera.
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:43.980]   I mean, you've got a lot of public figures now
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:45.740]   like McKenna and others who are just basically
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:47.980]   out there talking about psychedelics.
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:50.140]   Michael Pollan, who is more of a writer,
[02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:53.460]   foodie guy gone psychedelic dabbler, writer guy.
[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:57.820]   I know he's kind of a polymath, but you know,
[02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:01.840]   the legal status didn't seem to hinder their,
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.900]   at least online career.
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:05.260]   So I don't know, I haven't looked at their bank accounts,
[02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:08.060]   but I'm imagining they're doing just fine, right?
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:10.220]   So the fact that the work is happening
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:12.760]   inside of big institutions,
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.820]   I think it's important that you point out,
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:19.020]   and I'm just trying to underscore that that's in no way
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.880]   antagonistic to what people are doing.
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:23.800]   It's in support of a different sort of mission,
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.780]   which is to explore the validity in different contexts
[02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:31.060]   in a really controlled way, which I really, you know,
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:34.060]   I think it's a really important mission.
[02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:36.660]   I want to make sure that I ask you about
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.340]   the other really important mission that you're involved in
[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:40.540]   with respect to psychedelics,
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:43.680]   which is not about depression per se,
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.740]   but is about a neurologic injury or head injury.
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:49.460]   I realize it's early days for this,
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:54.220]   but I think there's a lot of concussion out there, sadly.
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:57.020]   There's a lot of TBI, traumatic brain injury,
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.060]   not just from sports.
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:00.380]   I think people sometimes forget that it's not,
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:04.260]   the major source of traumatic head injury is not football.
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:05.300]   It's not hockey.
[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:06.980]   It's not boxing.
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:08.520]   It's not any of that stuff.
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:10.900]   It's construction workers and it's people.
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:12.180]   I mean, if you've ever seen the helmets
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:14.060]   that construction workers wear, I mean-
[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:15.620]   - The jackhammer, oh my God.
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:16.460]   - The jackhammer.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:17.660]   - How could that not be just like-
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:19.820]   - I have a colleague that works on this in bioengineering.
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:22.660]   And when you look at the, you know, we always think sports,
[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:25.860]   but there are many people who make a living
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:30.100]   in a way that is over time is detrimental to their brain.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:32.320]   And they don't have the option of just not being
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.920]   a professional athlete or something of that sort.
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:36.760]   - And if they're not doing the construction,
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:37.600]   someone else needs to do it.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.000]   - Someone else has to do it, right.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.120]   And we forget, for some reason,
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.300]   and I too, it didn't occur to me until I heard it,
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:45.500]   like the people who were doing construction
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:48.340]   and then of course with bike accidents and falls
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:49.720]   and things like that as well.
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:50.560]   - Military.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.320]   - Military, absolutely.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:57.320]   So what do you think is the potential for these compounds,
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.040]   particularly psilocybin, but other compounds as well
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.940]   for the treatment and possible even reversal
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:08.540]   of neurological injuries and what sorts of things
[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:10.260]   are you excited to do in that realm?
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:13.140]   - Yeah, so this is definitely on the more exploratory end.
[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:17.020]   So it's based upon, so, you know, this is sort of
[02:20:17.020 --> 02:20:21.220]   beyond the improvement of psychiatric disorders
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:25.740]   like depression or depression and anxiety
[02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:27.980]   associated with a terminal illness
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:31.280]   or a substance use disorder, the addiction.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:34.900]   So those are sort of psychiatric disorders.
[02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:39.900]   So this is, you know, there are anecdotes of people saying
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:47.240]   that psychedelics have helped heal their brain.
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:49.480]   You know, they've been in one of these situations,
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:53.560]   like in sports, a sport where there's repetitive head impact
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:56.940]   and they're claiming that using psychedelics
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:59.740]   has actually improved their cognitive function,
[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:02.200]   for example, improved their memory,
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:05.340]   including improved their mood,
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.260]   but it's kind of more of the, you know,
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:11.880]   the cognitive function, things like memory are...
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:14.720]   Now, the caveat is if you've successfully
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.920]   improved someone's depression,
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:18.200]   you can get some cognitive improvement too,
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:21.660]   but that's a more of a weaker, more indirect effect.
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:24.720]   But if you take these anecdotes and you combine it
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.480]   way across orders of analysis to the rodent research
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:32.800]   from several labs like David Olson, Brian Roth,
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:35.220]   these folks that have shown different forms
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:38.160]   of neuroplasticity unfolding after,
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:41.960]   like sort of post-acutely.
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.440]   So after, in the days following the administration
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:46.680]   of psychedelic compounds,
[02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:48.640]   a variety of psychedelic compounds,
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:51.360]   and even some non-psychedelic structural analogs
[02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:56.760]   that you see these different forms of neuroplasticity.
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:00.380]   So the growth of dendrites and new connections
[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:02.960]   being formed with different neurons.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:07.960]   So those effects may be at play
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:11.580]   and they improve in the psychiatric treatments
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:13.320]   that we're dealing with.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:15.660]   We don't know that, it seems like a decent guess,
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:18.340]   and we're going to be figuring out whether that's the case.
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:20.660]   But another potential that that sets up
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:24.540]   is that maybe that's what's going on with these claims
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:31.120]   of improvements from neurological issues,
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:36.120]   that there's actually a repair of the brain
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:41.920]   from injuries underlying things that,
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.220]   situations where there's repetitive head impact,
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.280]   perhaps there's a potential for helping folks recover
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.700]   from stroke and disorders like that.
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:53.660]   There's a wide variety of disorders.
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:56.700]   Now, it's a bit of magic and a bit of like,
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:59.100]   it's something that the enthusiasts kind of
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:02.140]   can do some hand-waving and claim that this is already known.
[02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:04.120]   It is more exploratory.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:07.620]   But what I'm hoping to do is some work with retired athletes
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:12.640]   who have been exposed, but by the nature of their sport,
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:15.680]   for example, NNA athletes in the UFC,
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:18.920]   who have been exposed to repetitive head impacts
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:23.920]   like a lot of sports, a lot of sports expose people to,
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:26.100]   and who are retired from the sport
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:28.920]   and are suffering from say depression,
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:32.880]   which can impart result from those types
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:36.060]   of that history of head impact.
[02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:39.460]   See if we can fix the depression,
[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:41.740]   but then also as a cherry on top
[02:23:41.740 --> 02:23:44.060]   and a more exploratory aim,
[02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:47.580]   see if we can have evidence of improvement
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:50.780]   in cognitive function and associate like using MRI,
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:53.120]   see if it affects gray matter over time,
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:54.980]   these types of things to see if there are actually
[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:56.840]   some evidence of this improved,
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:01.440]   like this more direct repair of the brain.
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:04.060]   But again, it is very sort of like,
[02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:05.340]   we've got some rodent data,
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.140]   we've got some human anecdotes.
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:11.020]   - We will acknowledge its early days
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:14.100]   and we look forward to seeing the data.
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:17.220]   I appreciate how cautious you are and tentative you are,
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:19.020]   you're not drawing any conclusions.
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:23.420]   I think from a purely logical
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:26.220]   and somewhat mechanistic perspective,
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:29.740]   I mean, if we assume that lack of ability to focus
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:34.260]   or degradation and mood is the reflection
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.900]   of neurons in the brain, I think we can agree on that.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:39.580]   Some dialogue between neurons in the brain
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:41.060]   and that what needs to be changed
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:44.940]   is the nature of that dialogue, aka neuroplasticity.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:47.820]   We know that reordering of neural circuitry
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:51.740]   in the adult requires these things like intense focus
[02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:52.980]   followed by rest, et cetera.
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:56.820]   But the basis for that, like beneath focus is the mechanism,
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.700]   is a mechanism rather,
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:01.820]   beneath the bin that we call deep rest is a mechanism
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:05.660]   and those mechanisms are neuromodulator driven.
[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:09.840]   So to me, I'm not reviewing your grant,
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.380]   but from a rational perspective,
[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:17.620]   it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:21.720]   like serotonin or dopamine in a controlled way,
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:25.500]   and then coupling that with learning of some sort,
[02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:27.120]   sensory input of some sort,
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.020]   it makes sense that that would lead to,
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:33.660]   could, I should say, lead to reordering of circuitry
[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:37.300]   that would allow for better thinking, better mood,
[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.000]   many of the same things that you've observed
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.500]   in the clinical trials for depression.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.780]   So the rationale is really strong.
[02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:47.180]   I think that's a very exciting area.
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:48.900]   I get asked all the time about TBI
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:50.020]   and traumatic brain injury.
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:52.940]   And right now, it's kind of,
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:56.180]   there isn't a whole lot that people can do
[02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:59.820]   and people are dabbling in the space of hyperbaric chambers
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:02.380]   and people will do sauna and breath work
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:05.180]   and people are kind of clipping at the margins
[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:08.220]   of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull.
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:11.960]   So I think, I just want to applaud the exploration.
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:13.940]   I think it's great provided that exploration
[02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:15.260]   is being done in a controlled way.
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:18.980]   It sounds like that's what you're doing with the UFC.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:22.540]   - Yeah, so that, they were really gracious
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:25.140]   and had myself and a few of my colleagues
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.860]   out to their headquarters in Vegas.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:28.020]   - Impressive place, right?
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:29.660]   - It's in process.
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:31.100]   There's a dialogue going on there.
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:34.700]   I'm hopeful that there's going to be some work with them,
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:37.540]   but it's in process now in terms of exploring it.
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:40.740]   There's a real interest and I'm just really impressed
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:42.620]   by the organization and their commitment
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:46.420]   to athlete health and we'll see.
[02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:47.260]   - Yeah, I am too.
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:51.220]   We have a colleague out there,
[02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:53.100]   we're doing a little bit of work with them, Duncan French,
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:55.020]   who's a serious academic in his own right.
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:56.500]   And I think when people hear UFC,
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:58.920]   they just think about the octagon and fighting
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:00.580]   and pay-per-view fights and things.
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:02.080]   But in talking with them,
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:04.780]   and I'm sure you've had these discussions as well,
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:06.700]   they are very much interested in the health
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:08.900]   and longevity of their fighters.
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:11.800]   They are also interested in the health and longevity
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:13.260]   of their fighters being a template
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:15.420]   for how to treat traumatic brain injury
[02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:18.020]   and improve human performance in other sports
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:19.660]   and in the general public.
[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:22.300]   And I think it's not an image of the UFC
[02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.900]   that is commonly comes to mind
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:27.620]   'cause they haven't been particularly verbal
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:29.140]   about it in the press, but I think it's great
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:31.620]   they're bringing in academics, I mean, geeks like us
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:33.920]   going out to the UFC Performance Center.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:36.240]   I mean, you do MMA, but I'm basically just a geek
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.380]   walking through the place.
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:38.920]   But the fact that they're interested in talking
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:42.180]   to scientists is really, I'm biased here,
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:43.720]   but a point in their favor.
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:47.860]   Along the lines of other groups and individuals
[02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:50.220]   that have impacted the space that you're working in
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:53.040]   in this pioneering of the psychedelic space,
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:57.540]   a few years ago, I think if someone submitted a grant
[02:27:57.540 --> 02:28:01.440]   saying I want to study how psilocybin
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:04.660]   impacts human depression, I'm guessing,
[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:06.480]   having worked on these panels before,
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:09.900]   that the response might've been closer to,
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.020]   well, we need to do a lot of studies in rodents
[02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:13.320]   and a lot of studies in primates,
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.820]   and then maybe, just maybe, we could explore these drugs
[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:18.580]   because the National Institutes of Health
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:22.780]   actually has a whole institute devoted to addiction, right,
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.840]   of exploring compounds only in terms
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:26.700]   of their negative effects, right,
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:29.980]   which is where I've gotten all of my NIH funding
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:31.140]   over my career. - Which is so interesting,
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:33.300]   right, and it's a super important institute,
[02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:35.580]   I want to be clear, there are amazing people there.
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:40.580]   But philanthropy and foundations have been very important
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:43.140]   in supporting pioneering research.
[02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:46.820]   And so maybe we just talk a little bit about that.
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:51.100]   So your lab receives funding from taxpayer dollars
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.300]   through the National Institutes of Health.
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:56.140]   Is that mainly where your funding comes from?
[02:28:56.140 --> 02:29:00.900]   - So our group has gotten some funding from,
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:03.540]   like, say, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA,
[02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:06.860]   for some, a small subset of the psychedelic work,
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:11.700]   but only for some work geared towards understanding
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:13.240]   these things as drugs of abuse.
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:14.700]   Of course, when you do a study, though, you can--
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:17.020]   - Show us how they're, explore how they're bad.
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:18.460]   - Right, but when you're doing that,
[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:22.900]   you can explore the good stuff, too.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:27.280]   But the large majority of the work,
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:28.320]   and the most interesting work,
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.180]   has been funded by philanthropy.
[02:29:30.180 --> 02:29:32.060]   - Private philanthropy. - Now, I still have
[02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:36.280]   some grant support from NIDA outside of psychedelics.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:41.180]   I'm shifting more and more of my time
[02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:43.880]   towards focusing only on psychedelics,
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:47.900]   and in fact, us getting the center-level funding
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:51.900]   from some really big-picture philanthropists
[02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:54.820]   helped me to start to make that transition.
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:57.440]   But groups like the Hefta Research Organization,
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:29:59.840]   Dennis McKenna, which is one of the founding members,
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:01.260]   the brother of Terrence McKenna,
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.900]   who is, by the way, an ethnobotanist,
[02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:04.180]   that's what his PhD is in. - What does that mean,
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:05.260]   ethnobotanist?
[02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:08.380]   - Studying the, essentially, the anthropology
[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:12.500]   of psychoactive plant use, so--
[02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:13.740]   - You can get a degree in that?
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:17.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, hanging out with cultures
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.220]   and studying their use of these compounds
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:21.420]   in the traditional ways. - Wow, at Hopkins?
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.140]   That degree exists at Johns Hopkins?
[02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:26.420]   - I don't think that degree exists at Hopkins,
[02:30:26.420 --> 02:30:28.680]   but I mean, the kind of the most,
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:32.620]   and as you know from academia, I'm not,
[02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:35.740]   sometimes folks, I'm not sure how many people's PhD
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:38.620]   is actually in ethnobotany,
[02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:40.580]   or is actually in something else,
[02:30:40.580 --> 02:30:42.180]   but the real focus is, like,
[02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:45.120]   my degree is general experimental psychology,
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.340]   but I say human. - 10,000 kids out there
[02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:48.820]   just decided they're going to major in ethnobotany,
[02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:49.660]   but, you know, the--
[02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:52.340]   - I mean, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic area
[02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:54.340]   before Leary and before, and actually,
[02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:56.440]   he was late even for the human researchers,
[02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:59.100]   like folks like Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:00.580]   and Sidney Cohen were earlier,
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:04.180]   but even before those folks, Richard Schultes at Harvard,
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:06.640]   he was, I mentioned him earlier in the conversation,
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:10.060]   discovered all of this, these various tribes
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:12.980]   using ayahuasca or yage, a different name
[02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:16.060]   for the same thing, throughout South America,
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:19.100]   and these DMT-containing snuffs and all of this.
[02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:22.180]   So, you know, that was, you know, ethnobotany,
[02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:25.500]   this kind of intersection of anthropology
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:29.300]   and these psychoactive plant compounds.
[02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.900]   So, the Hefta Research Institute,
[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:36.820]   which Dennis is a founding and active member of,
[02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:41.160]   a board member, they have funded a lot of our early work.
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:46.160]   There's also an organization called the Beckley Institute,
[02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:50.100]   based in England, that Lady Amanda Fielding
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:52.320]   has been the head of, that has,
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:54.060]   they provided the first funding
[02:31:54.060 --> 02:31:57.940]   for our psilocybin smoking cessation research,
[02:31:57.940 --> 02:32:00.920]   and the Hefta came in and provided subsequent funding,
[02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:03.100]   but it's, and then there are other groups,
[02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:04.960]   a Council on Spiritual Practices,
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:07.740]   a great guy named Bob Jesse,
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:09.580]   funded some of the original work at Hopkins,
[02:32:09.580 --> 02:32:11.300]   looking at the nature of mystical experience,
[02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:14.780]   outside of treating disease states or disorders,
[02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:17.960]   but just understanding these, like,
[02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:22.000]   people take these compounds and astonishingly, you know,
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.160]   frequently we'll say that was the most important
[02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:25.460]   everything I've ever experienced.
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:27.020]   It's like, what the hell is that?
[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:28.900]   - Yeah, I had someone mention recently,
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:30.680]   I think this might surprise people a little bit,
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:31.960]   certainly surprise me, I had a friend
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:35.280]   who adores his children.
[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:38.440]   He's got three children, he adores his children,
[02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:40.960]   happy marriage and great, great father,
[02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:43.840]   they're both great parents, and he told me that,
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:48.620]   as part of a clinical trial, he had a DMT experience,
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:51.140]   that he claims, he said, I'd love to tell you
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:53.860]   that the birth of my children was as profound,
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:55.860]   but that was a more profound experience
[02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:57.620]   than the birth of my children,
[02:32:57.620 --> 02:32:59.940]   any one of them and all of them combined.
[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:01.520]   And I was like, wow, now I've never done DMT,
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:03.320]   but I was like, wow, that's a pretty strong statement.
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:05.280]   Now, he did it in the context of one of these,
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.020]   you know, clinical explorations.
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:10.220]   I assume that was part of a legal clinical trial,
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:13.240]   but the, I mean, that's saying something,
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:15.300]   it's saying something, I mean, he's a very rational,
[02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:20.300]   very grounded guy, otherwise, but,
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:23.980]   so philanthropy, foundations, and then in-
[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:25.840]   - Most recently, and so I just, I can't,
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:27.400]   'cause I can't skip it, our center-
[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:29.500]   - Oh yeah, you can't skip it, you can't skip magic.
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:30.340]   I see.
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:33.220]   - That's like, we, I mean, the Heffter group,
[02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:35.640]   the Beckley group, I mean, these are wonderful,
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:37.000]   I mean, these are people that have been holding
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.980]   the flame alive during the darkest hours,
[02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:42.140]   like the, same thing with the MAPS organization,
[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:44.760]   more on the MDMA side, like holding that candle
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:47.540]   during the darkest years, that, you know, so we've,
[02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:51.540]   but, you know, smaller organizations connected to smaller,
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:54.560]   but growing over time, you know, pockets of wealth,
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:57.380]   but, you know, we basically limped on,
[02:33:57.380 --> 02:34:00.620]   limped along on a wing and a prayer until recently,
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.140]   when we got the $17 million gift,
[02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.780]   so that we could create a nominal center.
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:06.680]   And as you know, basically to the university,
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:08.580]   that means you get a certain number of dollars,
[02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:10.860]   and a lot of them, you can call yourself a center.
[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:13.980]   You know, it's a capital investment, you know,
[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:17.800]   staff, you know, equipment, salary support,
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:20.660]   which has always been the huge thing for us.
[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:22.660]   But the $17 million gift,
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:26.460]   which was split between the Cohen Foundation,
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:30.340]   so Steven and Alexandra Cohen, and they covered half of it,
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.940]   and the other half, the Tim Ferriss collaborative,
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:35.860]   basically Tim and a few friends,
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:37.940]   ponied up that the, you know,
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:41.820]   divided the rest of that half of that $17 million gift,
[02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:44.340]   and came together to just, I mean,
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.900]   it just, it's completely transformed our,
[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:49.540]   the work that we've done, and our ability to,
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:53.500]   like, to fully delve into this area,
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:56.500]   and not worry that like, oh, if I focus on this,
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:59.060]   rather than putting another three NIDA grants
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:02.100]   on some other topic that may or may not get funded,
[02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:04.380]   like if I focus too much on the psychedelics,
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:06.060]   am I putting my career at jeopardy?
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:06.900]   But like, so-
[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:08.560]   - So you're now not only a tenured professor,
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.100]   you're also a full endowed-
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:11.940]   - Right, so that came a few months ago-
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:13.200]   - By the way, when you say somebody
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.100]   is a fully endowed professor,
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:16.340]   I want to be very clear what that means.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.180]   That means that there's funding-
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:20.340]   - Well, it might mean all of the above, but no, I'm joking.
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:23.300]   - I have no knowledge of your particular situation,
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:26.020]   but you probably do.
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:26.860]   - Just kidding.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:28.140]   - But sure, the,
[02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:32.520]   what we're essentially saying is that funding,
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:35.580]   which does not change somebody's salary level,
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:36.420]   I just want to be clear,
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:38.420]   'cause I think the general public isn't,
[02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:40.420]   there's no reason why they would understand
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:42.180]   all the nuts and bolts of how this works.
[02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:43.020]   - Academia is weird.
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:43.980]   - Yeah, academia is weird
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:46.540]   because we're not talking about increasing,
[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:48.340]   we're not talking about an endowment that,
[02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:52.180]   or philanthropy that went to increase Matt's salary.
[02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:55.660]   That's something that's set at the university level.
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:58.500]   It's always been said, and it is,
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:00.420]   at least it's still true now, which is that, you know,
[02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:02.060]   nobody goes into science for the money,
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:04.300]   at least not at the academic level.
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:10.900]   Not in academia, but allows people to devote
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:15.860]   more of their time and energy to these exploratory realms,
[02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:18.940]   like psychedelic research, or in the case of my lab,
[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:20.860]   the work that we're doing with David Spiegel's lab
[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:23.220]   on respiration, breath work, and hypnosis
[02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:24.900]   for modulating brain states.
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:26.600]   These are not typically areas
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:28.020]   that the National Institutes of Health
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:29.260]   and other major organizations
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:33.140]   have institutions set up to support.
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:35.820]   Now, there is an exciting initiative
[02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:38.780]   which is the NCCIH, which is Complementary Health.
[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:40.740]   - Right, used to be NCAM.
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:42.580]   - Yeah, at NIH. - Yeah, they changed their name.
[02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:44.400]   - And now we're not just throwing out acronyms
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:46.660]   just to bat back and forth acronyms,
[02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:49.940]   but I think what we're looking, what we're seeing now
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:54.940]   is a movement toward science and scientists and clinicians
[02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:58.660]   and the general public and philanthropy
[02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:01.900]   being engaged in this dialogue, which says,
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:04.380]   okay, there are problems in the world,
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:09.380]   depression, head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:12.920]   These problems clearly exist.
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:15.580]   The solutions are going to involve behaviors
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:18.420]   that are going to involve nutrition, supplementation,
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:19.300]   social connection.
[02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:21.460]   However, there are drugs.
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:23.660]   There are compounds that can change the brain
[02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:26.380]   and allow the brain to change its circuitry
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:27.220]   through experience.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:31.140]   And psychedelics are one of several others,
[02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:34.660]   but one of the powerful levers, it sounds like.
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:38.460]   And I just want to say that I think the reason
[02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:41.140]   I reached out to you and I'm so excited to sit down
[02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:46.140]   and chat with you is because I see very few people
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:51.160]   inside the halls of academia who have thrown their arms
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.440]   around this issue of psychedelics in a way
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:56.820]   and gone through the trouble of trying to find the funding
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:59.700]   to get it done, gone through the trouble
[02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:01.300]   of trying to set up clinical trials.
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:02.700]   I know what's involved in doing this.
[02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:03.980]   It's so complicated.
[02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:06.880]   It's so time-consuming and painstaking,
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:08.580]   and you've made real progress.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:10.580]   I mean, you guys are publishing papers.
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:13.620]   There's a new dialogue emerging that isn't just books
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:18.620]   on bookshelves and psychonaut gurus on the internet
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:21.140]   who also play an important role,
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:24.380]   but you're really moving this field forward.
[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:25.880]   And I know there are others as well.
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:28.300]   There are colleagues in England and others as well.
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:29.620]   We acknowledge them.
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:34.340]   But I just want to say personally that I'm like inspired
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:37.480]   and impressed by the way that you've gone about this
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:38.980]   and the level of rigor.
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:41.640]   I mean, when I ask you a question about serotonin,
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.380]   most people will just kind of kick back to me.
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.260]   Well, yeah, you got receptors and you got a ligand,
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:49.880]   but I mean, it's clear to me that you care about the details
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:52.980]   and that you care about the future of this area.
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:55.480]   And you also really care about these patients
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:56.460]   and these individuals.
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:39:00.280]   So I know I'm speaking on behalf of a ton of people now
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:02.820]   and in the future that don't even know
[02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:05.240]   what they're going to receive as a consequence of this.
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:10.240]   I just want to voice a real sincere thank you
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:11.400]   for that effort.
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:13.960]   It's like your lab and your work matters.
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:17.940]   And that's a really special and unique thing.
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:19.140]   - I appreciate that.
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:22.700]   I had a good colleague, in fact, shared some grant support
[02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:24.880]   under the multi-PI system years ago.
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:29.880]   And she actually took a job at NIH as a review officer.
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.780]   And I remember her telling me,
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:34.900]   and she actually left when she had multiple RO1s.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:35.740]   So it's like, she didn't move to it.
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:39.500]   - The RO1s are kind of the bread and butter, big grants
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.420]   that every card carrying,
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.140]   it's a mark of respect in our community
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:47.340]   to have one or several of these, yeah.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:50.980]   And it's like, you eat what you kill in academia.
[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:52.220]   It gets to what we're talking about later.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:53.860]   It's like, you don't make more money
[02:39:53.860 --> 02:39:56.900]   by pulling more grants, but you're able to pay the salary
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:40:01.100]   that like the university doesn't pay you your salary.
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:02.800]   It goes through them.
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:04.280]   - You're just able to do more work.
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:06.240]   - Yeah, and you're able to,
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:08.620]   and if you don't pull in the grants to cover your salary,
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:09.820]   your job can come to an end.
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:12.820]   Even if you're tenured at a place like Hopkins,
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:15.940]   they can do tricks like slowly lower your salary over these.
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:19.360]   - Or they just take away your space.
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:20.940]   - Yeah, they put you in a closet
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:23.260]   and give you no support for trainees
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:25.140]   and basically make life hell for you.
[02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:27.300]   So you can drive a cab in Baltimore
[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:29.540]   and call yourself a full professor at Hopkins,
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.140]   truthfully, but you may have no ability
[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:33.980]   to get anything done. - I'm sure they're out there.
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:35.900]   - But yeah, I remember one of the things
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:38.260]   this colleague said, who is successful,
[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:40.660]   but left on top said, "I really don't know
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:42.180]   that I'm making a difference in the world."
[02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:44.900]   And she did some great memory research
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:48.480]   and connected to drugs, also connected to aging.
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.700]   But she said, "I don't feel the impact
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.420]   of what I'm doing in the real world."
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:57.020]   And it's unfortunately there for a lot of academe.
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:59.340]   What we do, it stays in the Iver Tower.
[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:03.480]   The world is a beautiful but messed up place.
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:05.360]   And a lot of this doesn't disseminate
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:08.520]   and because of the various structures,
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:09.760]   the way the world is set up.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:14.760]   And thankfully, because the work that our group,
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:18.640]   as well as a few others around the world
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:21.100]   over the last 20 years, it's like you do have
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:23.700]   an emerging psychedelic startup industry now
[02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:25.100]   with billions of dollars of investment.
[02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:28.680]   And yeah, that's gonna turn into both good and bad,
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:30.300]   like it's upping the ante.
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:32.100]   Like there's gonna be a lot of good and bad
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:34.860]   that comes from that, but any new technology
[02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:35.780]   is gonna result in that.
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:38.420]   But we've got psilocybin designated
[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:41.540]   for two separate entities as a breakthrough therapy
[02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:43.720]   by the FDA and people may not realize.
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:48.560]   And MDMA is designated as a breakthrough therapy for PTSD.
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.000]   This is a really big deal.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.560]   That's a very high, I mean, pharma companies
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:57.940]   would pay millions of dollars to get their new drug
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:41:59.540]   a designation like that.
[02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:02.160]   And what it means is early research is showing,
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:05.080]   saying it shows a high potential for treating disorders
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.240]   that don't have very good treatments.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:10.640]   So we're in, we're probably, again,
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:12.240]   a few years away from both MDMA
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:14.080]   and probably a year or two after that psilocybin
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.420]   being treated for PTSD and depression respectively.
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.820]   This is, we have to wait for the phase three studies,
[02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:24.420]   but if the results hold up, even if the effect size
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:26.900]   is like halved of what we're seeing now,
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:29.600]   it's still gonna be a lot larger than what you're seeing
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:31.180]   with the traditional medications.
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:33.740]   And so it's gonna be approved if the data hold up
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:36.140]   and it probably will for my judgment.
[02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:40.200]   So I feel like what I'm doing is actually having
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:43.120]   a positive impact in the world in a way that,
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:46.000]   and I feel lucky that I got interested in an area
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.760]   that happens to plug into a place in the world
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.460]   where there is that opportunity,
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.800]   where some great colleagues and friends
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:58.200]   are focused on areas where I wish they had the opportunity
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:42:59.700]   for their work to be disseminated.
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:02.080]   I wish that, I mean, I was lucky to be interviewed
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:04.400]   on 60 Minutes because of this work.
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:05.960]   And I was like, oh my God, I know so many,
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.040]   there's a bit of imposter syndrome.
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:11.520]   Like, oh my God, I know so many scientists
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:16.520]   that deserve more so than me to have that level of exposure.
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:20.000]   But if you happen to be in that place
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.920]   where you gotta do your best to make it work,
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:26.520]   to take advantage of that luck
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:29.400]   and that intersection of the world and to push it.
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:32.160]   And I've been lucky, but also did take a bit of a leap
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:33.920]   of faith early on.
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.360]   I did have some advisors that told me like,
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:39.740]   you've got a really promising pedigree early on.
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:42.220]   Like, are you sure you want to focus much time
[02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:43.360]   on this psychedelic stuff?
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:44.900]   - You've embraced risk.
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:46.440]   I mean, I think that, I mean,
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:50.080]   the world's changed since in 2020, certainly,
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:53.800]   but channels like social media, podcasts
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:55.200]   and things of that sort,
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:58.080]   your exposure is because people are interested
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:00.760]   in these topics and that's why people like myself
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:03.160]   are interested in talking to you.
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:06.900]   I mean, at Stanford, there are now a few labs
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:09.880]   starting to explore psychedelics more at the mechanistic
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:13.480]   level, but so in animal models, excellent labs,
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.620]   but also I can imagine because of the pioneering work
[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:18.560]   that you've done at Hopkins,
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:20.880]   it'll start to become more common.
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:22.840]   I'm certain that people are going to have questions
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.000]   about how to get in contact with you and learn more.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.900]   If people have trauma, PTSD, depression,
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:35.160]   it's likely that they're going to start seeking ways
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.300]   in which they can potentially participate
[02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:39.180]   in clinical trials.
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:42.220]   You're very active on Twitter, active, I should say,
[02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:43.340]   you've got other obligations,
[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.100]   but where you are active on social media,
[02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:46.000]   you're active on Twitter.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.360]   It's drug, it's @drug_researcher, correct?
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.580]   - Right, right, right.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.420]   - Okay.
[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:55.940]   - Drug_researcher, that's how to find me.
[02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:57.340]   - Great account, by the way.
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:01.040]   Matthew and I recently got into a dialogue there
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:03.380]   about some of the deeper effects of psychedelics
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.780]   in the literature versus how they're being discussed
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:06.740]   in the general public.
[02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:09.820]   And I follow his account and it's a really wonderful account
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:13.740]   for whether or not you have a science background or not.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:16.420]   If people are, and I'm going to try and persuade you
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:17.940]   to be more active on Instagram,
[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:19.340]   but I don't know if I'll succeed in that.
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:20.180]   - I'll try to get my Instagram game going on.
[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:22.060]   - You're a busy guy and I get it.
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.740]   I'm running a lab too, I get it, you're busy,
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:27.740]   but drug_researcher there as well.
[02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:29.060]   - Same handle.
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:30.660]   - The same handle.
[02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:33.180]   Your lab at Hopkins is pretty straightforward
[02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:35.260]   to find through a Google search of your name,
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:37.740]   Matthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University.
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:42.740]   Are there portals for people to explore clinical trials,
[02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:45.060]   participation in clinical trials of various kinds?
[02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:46.820]   - Yeah, and so in our group,
[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:51.500]   so you go to hopkinspsychedelic.org, that's the website.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:52.740]   And if you can't remember that,
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:54.700]   just Johns Hopkins Psychedelic.
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:55.540]   - Yeah, we will provide a link.
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:45:57.380]   - And you're going to find us.
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:45:59.300]   It'll be the first thing that pops up.
[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:03.140]   And we have, trust me, if we have a study on something,
[02:46:03.140 --> 02:46:04.780]   it's going to be on that website.
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:07.220]   - That means they're being very polite.
[02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:09.420]   So I will be a little bit more aggressive and say,
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:10.980]   don't email him directly.
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:12.460]   He won't see that email.
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:14.540]   Wait until there's a posting for a study
[02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:16.380]   and then sign up through the correct portal.
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:18.220]   - And I try to get back to those emails,
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:21.620]   but frankly, and it's 'cause, you know,
[02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:23.620]   I'm lucky the area has taken off so much,
[02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:27.060]   but there are many days where I simply get so many requests
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:28.900]   that I can't get through my day.
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:32.380]   Yeah, if I answer all the, so yeah, trust me.
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:34.260]   And something that a lot of folks don't get
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:35.900]   in being in academia like we are,
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:38.020]   it's easy to forget how people don't,
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:40.220]   understandably don't realize this.
[02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:42.400]   This is experimental research.
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:45.300]   It's FDA approved as an experiment.
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:47.900]   You know, so we're working towards formal FDA approval
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:49.060]   for straight up clinical use.
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:51.480]   But right now someone can't bring me a case
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:56.140]   of some idiosyncratic thing and say,
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:58.220]   I'm suffering from this complex constellation
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:46:59.060]   of depression. - You're not a clinician.
[02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:02.100]   - Yeah, I'm not a clinician, and even if I was,
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:05.180]   I wouldn't be able to treat them with psilocybin
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:10.180]   or to send them anywhere that was legal to take it.
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:14.500]   You know, so if we're gonna be treating you,
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:17.140]   it has to be, or anyone else in the United States
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:19.280]   or most other countries for that matter,
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:20.720]   it's gonna have to be under the guise
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:22.680]   of a very specific protocol.
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.260]   This number of milligrams to treat PTSD,
[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:28.080]   to treat major depressive disorder,
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.940]   to treat treatment resistant tobacco use disorder,
[02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:36.460]   so nicotine addiction, very specific studies.
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:38.540]   This is not one-off treatment.
[02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:41.760]   And folks say like, oh, I can pay to go out to Baltimore.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:45.040]   If you see, oh, my son has this complex,
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.880]   like in their tragic cases.
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:50.660]   So if you're interested in a study, go to our website.
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:54.480]   If it's not on their website, we don't have a study on it.
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:56.020]   There are gonna be forthcoming studies.
[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:58.860]   So I'm gonna be starting studies on opioid addiction
[02:47:58.860 --> 02:48:02.120]   and PTSD and an LSD study for chronic pain.
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:05.600]   The day that those are open for recruitment,
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:06.960]   they're gonna be up on our website.
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:09.240]   So that's where you look to see everything.
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:11.260]   And in fact, I would just recently, a couple of days ago,
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:12.560]   put up a couple of survey studies,
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:15.400]   also where we post links to our survey studies.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:18.200]   So if you've had psychedelics and you've taken them
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:21.720]   for therapeutic intent for PTSD or for depression
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:23.600]   or anxiety, you can find a link.
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:25.760]   And also if you've done breath work for those reasons,
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.580]   we have a link for a study of that type up there now,
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:30.500]   which is a holotropic style breath,
[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:33.900]   very psychedelic type of breathing technique
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:37.180]   that can lead to some of these similar experiences.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.040]   So it's up there.
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:40.500]   More broadly outside of our group,
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:42.400]   'cause there's a growing number of groups
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:45.580]   in the US and in Europe doing this research,
[02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:49.320]   but you can go to clinicaltrials.gov.
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:54.320]   And if you look in for the main search term of psilocybin
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:58.080]   or MDMA or psychedelic plugin, those terms,
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:00.160]   you can get a list of the growing number.
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:04.600]   I mean, I think there's over 40, maybe it's been a while.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:06.120]   There might be over 50 now, I don't know,
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:09.400]   but studies with just psilocybin going on right now
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:10.920]   on clinicaltrials.gov.
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:13.840]   So check out clinicaltrials.gov to see what's going on,
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.480]   but it's going to be, if you're going to do anything legal,
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:20.320]   it's going to be in the context of a very specific study.
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.600]   It's not going to be one-off treatment.
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:25.180]   - Right, and I should say, and not just legal,
[02:49:25.180 --> 02:49:28.960]   but also supported in the right framework
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:32.100]   that you described of having a team, et cetera.
[02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:34.640]   Obviously people will do what they will do.
[02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:38.480]   Oh yeah, go ahead.
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:41.640]   - I will say, I never encourage people to take drugs of any,
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:42.960]   I don't encourage caffeine use.
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.520]   Every drug has its risk.
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:47.800]   - I encourage my own caffeine use, but nobody else's.
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:49.640]   - I'm drinking up right now, this is great.
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:52.160]   - Yeah, this is a very strong mate is what we're drinking.
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:56.560]   It does not lead to a alteration in my perception of self
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:49:58.360]   to the extent that we talked about earlier.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:02.000]   However, this conversation wasn't a good example
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.960]   of how we can enter a perceptual bubble.
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:07.160]   I learned so much about psychedelics
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:10.340]   and the future of this for sake of mental health
[02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:12.060]   and other aspects of health.
[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:16.660]   Matt, thank you so much for your time, for your knowledge.
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:20.960]   And I think you put it best earlier for holding the candle
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:24.720]   in a very dark time and then now there's light.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.680]   - Thank you.
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:27.240]   Well, thanks for helping to spread that light.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:30.280]   And I really appreciate what you've been doing.
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:33.280]   This is a great, great medium that you have going on.
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:35.240]   So thank you for doing it.
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:37.520]   - Well, it's my pleasure, thank you.
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:39.500]   Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:41.520]   with Dr. Matthew Johnson.

[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:18.080]   because Thorne has the highest quality standards
[02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:20.620]   with respect to the quality of ingredients
[02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:22.800]   in their supplements, as well as precision
[02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.540]   about the amounts of those ingredients
[02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:25.880]   within their supplements.
[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:30.040]   If you go to Thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:32.200]   you can see all the supplements that I take,
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.560]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements,
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:37.200]   as well as 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:39.280]   that you find on the Thorne site.
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:41.800]   So if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:44.520]   excuse me, Thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:48.040]   you'll get 20% off any of the products that Thorne makes.
[02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:52.760]   Also, we have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:54.600]   and there you can support the podcast
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:56.440]   at any level that you like.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.240]   And last but not least,
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:00.200]   thank you for your interest in science.
