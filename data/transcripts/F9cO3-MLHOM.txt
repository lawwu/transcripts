[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260]   I'm Bill Gurley.
[00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.360]   I got to Silicon Valley in about 1997
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.800]   and was fortunate enough to become a venture capitalist in '98.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.240]   And the entire first year of my career,
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.380]   I had zero interest in interacting with any form of government.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.960]   It didn't seem necessary for what I was trying to do.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.640]   I was working with founders and software and technology.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.980]   I didn't see what it would bring me.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.680]   Until one day, where I ran into an issue, which I'll tell you about later,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000]   that required me to understand what was going on in Washington.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.020]   So I checked in with a few advisors.
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.840]   They introduced me to this lawyer in DC.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440]   Turns out, DC lawyers do a lot of things that aren't lawyering.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.180]   (Laughter)
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.980]   And he listened to what I had to say, "I'll call you back."
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.920]   He calls me back, he says, "Bill, I got exactly what you need.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.720]   I found a congressman on the committee that matters to what you're talking about,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.000]   and I can set up a meeting."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.320]   I go, "Great, I'll fly out."
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.040]   He goes, "No, no, no, don't fly out. He's coming to you."
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   I go, "Really? That's pretty nice."
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040]   He goes, "Do you have a conference room?"
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.320]   I said, "I'm a venture capitalist. We have lots of conference rooms."
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.160]   So he said, "I need you to get some people together, and here's the catch.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.340]   They need to bring $5,000 each."
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460]   (Laughter)
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.920]   Hung up the phone.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160]   Started thinking, "All right, I got six people.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.220]   We got board members, CEO, $5,000, $30,000.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.460]   He's calling me back next week. How's it going?
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.680]   Great, I got six people, $5,000, ready to go."
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.640]   He goes, "Most of these meetings have 10 to 12 people."
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.080]   I said, "Shit!
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520]   Now I'm inviting people that don't even have anything to do with this thing
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   and having to help them out.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240]   I'm up to 60K, I hang up."
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.200]   He called me back a week later, he goes, "Bill, how's it going?"
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.120]   I go, "Shit, I got 12 people.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.440]   Everybody's got a check, we're ready to go.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.360]   I'm losing interest at this point."
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.560]   He goes, "Do they have spouses?"
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.760]   I'm like, "What kind of question is this? Do they have spouses?"
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   He goes, "Yeah, let's have their spouses write $5,000 each."
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.560]   I go, "Our conference room's not big enough for the spouses."
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   He goes, "They don't have to come."
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.760]   (Laughter)
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.720]   This is a true story, by the way, true story.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.280]   And it would go on to happen two more times in my life,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.440]   and then I stopped meeting with congressmen.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.720]   (Laughter)
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   (Applause)
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   The reason that I needed to engage relates to this company.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.480]   My fourth VC investment was in a company called Tropos Networks.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   We had industrial-grade mesh Wi-Fi,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.640]   you could mount it on a telephone pole and bathe a city in Wi-Fi broadband.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.680]   It was awesome.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.280]   We were so excited about it, we were changing the world, it was disruptive.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.320]   Google got excited about it, Earthlink got excited about it.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680]   But the customer I loved the most that got excited about were mayors.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.920]   There were hundreds of mayors all over the country
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480]   that wanted to provide free Wi-Fi service across their downtown area.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.200]   It would help with public safety, economic development,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   and of course, digital divide.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.760]   So we were so thrilled, I was so pumped, I was sure we had a winner here.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   And then one day, these two people got excited,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   which turned out not to be a good thing.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.000]   This is Mayor Street of Philadelphia and his CIO, Diana Neff.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.080]   They got just as excited as I did.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   They were idealistic, they were, you know, optimistic,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   maybe they were quixotic, maybe I was too.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.320]   Because the next thing that happened is what caused me to get that meeting.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.960]   You can't read this, but it says, "Lobbyists try to kill Philly wireless plan."
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.160]   And in the article, it says,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.040]   "Philly's plan to offer an inexpensive wireless internet service,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.920]   the most ambitious yet, collided with commercial interest."
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.680]   Collided with commercial interest.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   There were no voters or citizens up in arms about this.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   Commercial interest.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.320]   How many of you, I know this is a younger crowd,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.760]   how many of you are old enough to remember Schoolhouse Rock?
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.720]   Awesome.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.400]   So, like you, I learned about how Congress works
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.840]   by ABC Saturday morning television.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.080]   And they told us, there's a phrase in this, I looked up the script,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   it said, "Some folks back home want it all."
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.240]   So they called their local congressman,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   implying that the people that have the need are the citizens
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.480]   and the people that write the law, the congressman.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   Imagine how surprised I was when I read this.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.720]   "Philadelphia was embarking on the research phase of the project
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.120]   when Verizon successfully pushed a bill through the state legislature."
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.840]   Verizon's writing legislation?
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.040]   How does that work?
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.320]   (Laughter)
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.360]   Now, it turns out, this wasn't even our biggest problem
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.560]   because another company's headquartered in Philadelphia named Comcast.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.200]   They had put a bill on Governor Rindle's desk,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.520]   proposal drafted by lobbyists for the telecommunications companies.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.000]   This isn't what I learned on Schoolhouse Rock.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   (Laughter)
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.600]   The governor whose bill that was on the desk of is Ed Rindle.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.960]   He's on the right.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.720]   Before he was governor, he was mayor of Philadelphia.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.960]   The gentleman in the middle is named Michael Nutter.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.920]   He would go on to replace Street and was a longtime council member.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.960]   But the guy on the left was the real nemesis.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.440]   This is David Cohen, chief lobbyist for Comcast.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.920]   Now, David Cohen is to corporate lobbying what Bob Marley is to reggae.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.080]   He's like - (Laughter)
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.200]   There's no second.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.560]   The New York Times did a profile of him called "Comcast Real Repairman,"
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.760]   in which they say he's the most important executive in the whole company,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.320]   and I fundamentally believe that.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080]   It also says he's probably one of the most savvy corporate political operatives
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.240]   in the history of US business.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.480]   The article on the right from the "Enquirer"
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   calls him "Philadelphia's most powerful unelected official."
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   I don't even know how you can put those words together.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.760]   (Laughter)
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.280]   So here we are, in our little conference room
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.560]   with our spousal-enhanced checkbooks,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.720]   and this is like a second grader challenging Michael Jordan
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.960]   to a game of one-on-one for money.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.120]   Like, we were pissing in the ocean.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.840]   We had no chance. No chance.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.880]   Now guess who offers city-wide Wi-Fi?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.160]   That one's easy.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.760]   AT&T would join this fight.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.480]   Within two years, they would outlaw municipal broadband in over 22 states.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.320]   They'd just write it into the books
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.040]   and just took the power of these local decision-makers away from them,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   all in the interest of the commercial interest, not the citizen.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.680]   I want to talk about another piece of telecom legislation.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   My partnership back in those days invested in telecom equipment,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.320]   and so we were very interested in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.080]   This was heralded as the most important telecommunications reform in 62 years.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   Now this one's simple.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.040]   I'm just going to use the headlines from Wikipedia.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.960]   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 had two goals,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.680]   to promote competition
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.600]   and to encourage the rapid development of new technologies.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   Let's see how things went.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.560]   (Laughter)
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.800]   In 1996, the top four had 48% market share.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.520]   Four or five years later, after this heralded legislation,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.160]   they're up to 85%.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.600]   That didn't work.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   (Laughter)
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.480]   Let's check in on the second one.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.240]   Were they promoting innovation?
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.480]   This is a chart of VC dollars into telecom equipment.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.440]   This used to be 15% of what VCs did.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.160]   Within 10 years, it had gone below 1%,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   and a year later, the NVCA stopped tracking it.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720]   Now, if you want to talk to one of the expert VCs
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.200]   in telecommunications equipment,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.160]   it'll be easy to do because they're retired.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   (Laughter)
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.600]   This market's gone.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.720]   There is no more innovation in telecom equipment.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.160]   So what happens here?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.400]   How can you possibly have a super important bill
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.160]   signed by and implemented by one of the most heralded presidents
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.240]   in our generation that doesn't just fail?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.720]   Failing would be things stay the same,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.400]   and you don't accomplish the goal.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.480]   This did even worse.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.600]   It created the opposite thing of what it was supposed to go do.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.760]   Let me introduce you to George Stigler.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.680]   He's the 1982 Nobel Prize winner in economics
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.880]   and the father of regulatory capture.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   This is his most famous quote.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.440]   "As a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.120]   and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit."
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.040]   I like to say regulation is the friend of the incumbent.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.280]   Quick audience, interaction moment.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.440]   That's the one thing I want you to take away.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.120]   So on the count of three, scream,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.280]   "Regulation is the friend of the incumbent."
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.120]   One, two, three.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.160]   (Audience) Regulation is the friend of the incumbent.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.120]   Yes! Amen!
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.160]   All right.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.800]   (Applause)
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.840]   So this is the only slide I have with bullets
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   because this is going to be a two-minute regulatory capture 101,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.200]   all from George Stigler's notes.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.240]   The first thing he says,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.440]   "In regulatory capture, special interest is prioritized
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.520]   over the general interest of the public."
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.600]   Sound familiar from my other stories?
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.720]   Leading to a net loss for society.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.160]   A net loss for society, that's important.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.960]   The two mechanisms they usually use is the second bullet,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.680]   limited market entry and price protection or even price increases,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.280]   which I'll show you more of.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.560]   And then the mechanisms of influence are money,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.880]   made worse by Citizens United,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.000]   exposure, just time around people,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.720]   and then three, revolving doors.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.080]   This is super important, and I'll show you one great example of that.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   That's people moving in and out.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   When they interviewed Christie on the pod the other day,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.000]   they were talking about this in the military.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.640]   All right.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.040]   This is a piece of Morgan Stanley research from 1999.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.440]   Someone took the time to go study five pieces of major US legislation
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.960]   that had happened over the years
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.680]   and how the incumbent stocks did after the legislation.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.360]   And let's just steal a few sentences from this.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.520]   "Conclude that landmark regulatory action
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.600]   is a tendency to improve returns
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.480]   for the largest players in the targeted industry.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.120]   Long-term investors should consider capitalizing
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.800]   on any temporary weakness caused by market reaction to regulation.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.640]   Many attempts to increase competition
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.920]   or improve customer experience have failed.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.560]   This is reinforcing what Stigler taught us."
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.640]   Here's a very simple, quick one.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   Number of new banks in the US, 2009, nothing.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   Dodd-Frank.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   Like, that's what happens.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.600]   All right.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.880]   Two really good stories.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.440]   You might not even believe them because they're so outlandish.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.240]   Does everyone know who Epic is?
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.080]   It's hard to know because they're not public.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.040]   It's a very large private company in Wisconsin
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.720]   that is the largest player in medical EHR software,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.760]   medical records.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.560]   And this is their CEO, Judith Faulkner.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.440]   Now, in-- get the year right-- 2009,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.040]   Obama put her on his health IT council.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.760]   She was the only corporate representative.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.040]   Should not surprise you that she's a major donor to Obama.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.560]   Now, Obama passed the American Recovery Act.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.400]   That was his big piece of stimulus,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.000]   kind of like Biden's Inflation Act that happened recently.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.760]   And tucked underneath that, easy to hide in this big bill,
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.240]   is an act that was-- the acronym's HITECH.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.800]   It's this Health Information Technology thing.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.320]   And then they created an agency called ONC that oversaw it.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.840]   Now, this is the part you're not going to believe.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   They came up with a brilliant idea.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.480]   I have to assume she helped encourage this.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:23.440]   Doctors would receive $44,000 each if they bought software.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.080]   $38 billion.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.680]   This is true.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.520]   You can look it up.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   I'm not making it up.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.640]   $44,000, give it to a doctor, implement some software.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.720]   Many of you run companies.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   That'd be pretty cool, right?
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.080]   The government passed a law.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.160]   If they buy your software, they get money.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   Make it a lot easier.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.840]   Now, you may be thinking, are doctors needy?
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.080]   But here's the catch.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.000]   Remember, this happened because of the mortgage meltdown.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.600]   Doctors own multiple homes, so they have multiple mortgages.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.080]   So they--
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.680]   They probably needed the assistance.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.040]   Now, there's two more things about this act
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.240]   that are also unbelievable.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.560]   First, there's a flaw.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   If someone said, yeah, I'm going to pay people to buy software,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.880]   most people would be like, well, you're
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.520]   going to have a problem.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.360]   They're going to buy it, and they're not
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.280]   going to use it, right?
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.720]   Well, they thought of that.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.280]   So guess what?
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.200]   The second phase, doctors got paid $17,000 more
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.160]   to prove they were using it.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.360]   It was called meaningful use, plastered all over the website
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.880]   of all the HR vendors at the time.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.080]   It gets even better.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:37.240]   So the ONC decided the threshold of features
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   you would need for your software to comply with this mandate.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.200]   And I'm assuming they kind of took Epic's feature set
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.520]   and plowed it into this spreadsheet.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.760]   But they got the Department of Justice
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.200]   to enforce people that didn't have the feature set that
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.240]   were getting the payments.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.520]   And you had three record fines, $155 million, $57 million,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.040]   $145 million against the lesser competitors of Epic.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.840]   Unreal.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.080]   If you've studied the innovators' dilemma,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.520]   the way startups disrupt is they come in
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.840]   with lower feature products, but a feature that really matters
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.000]   to the customer, and a simpler product, and they move up.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.160]   They put a brick wall there, so you couldn't come up.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.400]   It's just amazing.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.440]   Obama, in an interview with Ezra Klein,
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.720]   said this was the most disappointing part
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.000]   of Obamacare.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.860]   I mean, I think if any of us were
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.320]   in the room when they scratched this thing out,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.240]   I could have told them it would have failed.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.200]   I mean, paying people to do stuff is just--
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.440]   it's not going to work.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.640]   Now, you may ask, am I unhappy with Judith?
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.280]   I'm disgusted with it.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.520]   But if I were a judge in the Olympic regulatory capture
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.760]   competition, I'm giving her a 10.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.120]   This is fantastic.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.720]   Fantastic.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.480]   All right, one more.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.280]   Revolving doors.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.320]   This is one more.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.560]   So many of you know what this is.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.120]   This is a COVID rapid antigen test.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.320]   Now, this is based on a very simple piece of technology--
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.280]   hopefully, David will confirm this when he comes back up--
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.240]   called a lateral flow assay.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.160]   Now, this technology was developed 80 years ago in 1943,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.040]   and it's a complete commodity.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.880]   The packaging almost doesn't matter.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.080]   You could probably use the strip without it.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.280]   Now, before I tell you what happened in the US,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.120]   let me tell you what happened in Europe.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.000]   Germany leaned heavily into rapid tests.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.120]   They got their scientists together,
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.680]   and they evaluated 122 different vendors
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.080]   and validated 96 of them.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.440]   Here they are on the right.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.160]   96 different vendors that they OKed.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.840]   And as a result, in the German market,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.280]   you could buy five tests for 3.75 or 75 euro cents a test.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.600]   UK leaned in as well.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.280]   They got them in such numbers and so cheap
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.320]   they distributed them to people's homes.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.160]   So what was going on in the US?
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.080]   Around that time, the New York Times
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.640]   did an article like, here's what's
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.880]   going on with antigen tests.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.760]   First of all, they fought them forever,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.680]   and I think that may be captured as well,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.280]   because the hospitals were making a ton of money on PCR
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.920]   tests.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.080]   I think they made as much money as they did on vaccines.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.040]   But that's another story.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.280]   Here it says, all the manufacturings
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   are ramping up production, but right now they're hard to find.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.920]   And then it lists which tests are available,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.120]   and they only list three vendors-- Abbott, Ellumi,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.280]   and Quidel.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.360]   Three vendors.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.600]   Now, you can play along on your phone
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.880]   if you want to go on LinkedIn.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.760]   This guy's name is Timothy Stenzel.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.800]   Now, he works for the FDA, and he
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.520]   runs the group that oversees which antigen test gets
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.440]   approved.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.240]   I know this because he would write scathing letters
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.360]   to the ones he rejected that you can also look up online.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.640]   Now, guess what?
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.520]   You're not going to be surprised.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.880]   Five years at Quidel, four years at Abbott.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:33.560]   It gets worse.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.920]   President Biden decided finally to lean into antigen tests
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.920]   and authorized $2 billion to go purchase tests.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.000]   He should have gone to Germany and bought them out
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.680]   of the stores, but instead--
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.400]   But instead, he bought them from these guys.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.920]   Now, I don't know if you've ever used this test.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.240]   All that packaging is complete and utter bullshit
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.960]   and unnecessary.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.920]   That popsicle stick thing, like, everyone else
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   uses the lateral flow SA plastic thing
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.120]   that you can buy super cheap.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   This was over-engineered.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.720]   And then I get really pissed, because the Wall Street
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.360]   Journal wrote an article that was
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.800]   a victory lap for Abbott's antigen test execution
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.840]   and how well they did in the market.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.720]   And I've never met Brianna or Peter,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.480]   but I hope they get to watch this,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.120]   because the first thing they should have done in the article
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.000]   is put a big picture of Timothy Stenzel,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.800]   because that's why this thing worked.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.240]   And they write the eye-catching card on a lollipop stick
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.840]   as if, oh, it was so cute, everyone bought it.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.760]   Like, if you tried to sell that thing in Germany,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.320]   how many would sell?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.560]   Zero.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.120]   Like, at $12 a test.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.600]   Yesterday, just for kicks, kind of, I went online.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.080]   This is Walgreens and CVS antigen tests.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.880]   There's seven tests.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.400]   They're all exactly $23.99.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.320]   What is that?
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.580]   That's not a marketplace.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.100]   That's not open competition.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.240]   I also went on Boots, the famous UK.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   The tests are about $1.50, $1.60 per, today.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.680]   So you have a 6x differential in these tests today.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.040]   And by the way, I'm not even talking about the fact
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.840]   that our citizenry may have been much enhanced
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.160]   by having rapid tests at a much lower price
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.960]   if they were treated as the commodity they were.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.160]   Of course, they weren't.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.880]   Now, Washington's got its eyes on Silicon Valley,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.280]   and it's from both sides.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.320]   We've got Lindsey Graham.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.920]   We've got Elizabeth Warren.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.520]   There's an article here that says,
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.680]   Major E. Green agrees with AOC, breaking up big tech.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.880]   And you say, why?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.120]   Why are they so interested in tech?
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.360]   This is a poll of voters.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.440]   Voters don't care.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.480]   Voters are more worried about the industries
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.720]   where there's a lot of regulatory capture,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.120]   but they want to come after tech.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.680]   I think I know why.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.480]   I think they want them in the system, like the military,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.600]   like finance, like telecom.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.560]   They want them in the system because there's money.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.640]   Now, if Elizabeth Warren attacks big tech,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.160]   you think they might go fund the competitor.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.800]   And you probably can't read this, but this is open secret.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.680]   Spend time on open secrets.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.400]   Four of the top 10 contributors to Elizabeth Warren
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.360]   are Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.640]   You attack them, they have to come to you.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.040]   Some of our peers in Silicon Valley
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.360]   seem to want them to come, too.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.960]   I think they've read Stigler.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.360]   Circle, please regulate us.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.600]   Brian's on later, so this is risky.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.000]   The more regulation--
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.520]   I think he's right, by the way.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.160]   The more regulation, the better for Coinbase.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.280]   That's exactly what Stigler would say.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.880]   Mark Zuckerberg needs, wants, and must have regulation.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.320]   I get it, Mark.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.200]   And Sam's just getting started.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.960]   He wants regulation, too.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.760]   Now--
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:18.800]   There's a really scary thing in this AI space.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.000]   The incumbents that are running to meet with all the government
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.240]   are spreading something that I don't think is accurate or fair.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.600]   They're spreading a negative open source message.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.640]   And I think it's precisely because they
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.200]   know it's their biggest threat.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.760]   And I think what Matt has done with LamaTube
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.320]   is actually super interesting.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.680]   All right, I'm going to wrap up with three things, three
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.320]   takeaways.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.360]   First, I'm not convinced we're very good at regulation.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.200]   All four of the stories I told you were failures.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.960]   Like, they were a net loss for society, as Stigler says.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.200]   There's a picture of Patrick Monaghan,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.520]   who was one of the best senators I think we've ever had.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.080]   He kept a picture of a pen behind his desk as a reminder.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   He felt like Congress should have
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.200]   to have something similar to the Hippocratic Oath
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.440]   that doctors have.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.000]   First, do no harm.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.680]   And the reason he has that point of view
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.120]   is he feels personally responsible for the homeless
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.800]   situation in America.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.120]   He signed an act with JFK in 1963
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   that shut down the mental health institutions.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.360]   It had a second piece that was supposed to prop something up.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.400]   This happens with policy.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.240]   Second part didn't happen, emptied out the mental health.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.320]   And when everyone talks about the homeless problem,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.040]   they should read this interview with him
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.360]   because they don't go back and talk about this issue.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.880]   But it's very relevant.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.520]   So I don't think we're very good at it.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.080]   That's the first thing.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.920]   Second, I think regulatory capture
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.800]   gives capitalism a bad name.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.200]   A couple of people yesterday said,
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.720]   oh, we've got to fix capitalism.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.440]   I think where capitalism's broken
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.520]   is where the capture's the highest, right?
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.080]   Like I just showed you some examples.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.120]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.640]   You've seen these charts of price across time.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.400]   And the highly competitive products
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.280]   coming out of Silicon Valley are dropping like crazy.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.920]   It's health care and education and those kind of things
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.640]   where you have price increases.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   Lastly, one of my favorite authors
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.520]   is Matt Ridley, and these two books
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.560]   really cover the span of human time.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.160]   And he talks about how three things-- technology, commerce,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.880]   and the sharing of ideas--
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.680]   leads to prosperity for people, leads to increases
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.160]   in standard of living.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.360]   And my big fear is that regulation
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.840]   is the opposite of this.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.520]   It's a blocker to innovation.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.280]   So if you care about prosperity and you kill innovation,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.640]   you're going to kill prosperity from my point of view.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   So in closing, the reason I picked this title
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.400]   is Silicon Valley's 2,851 miles away from Washington.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.280]   And as these people put their eyes toward this,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.080]   I would state the following.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.720]   The reason Silicon Valley's been so successful
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.120]   is because it's so fucking far away from Washington, DC.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   Thank you.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Are we talking?
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   Are we doing it?
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.580]   OK.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.580]   We're doing it.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.060]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:40.580]   Ladies and gentlemen, Bill fucking Gurley.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.540]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   Well--
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.100]   That was it.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.980]   Highlight.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.700]   I think we know the best--
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.740]   Let's all go home.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.940]   I think the best talk in the history of all in.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.900]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.900]   Boom.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.460]   And we need to get it out there immediately
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.780]   so it can start going viral.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.500]   And I think it will go very viral.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.940]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.020]   Well, you know, I'm just a guy with some experiences.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.180]   And I put it together in a deck.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.700]   And if you take from it whatever you get,
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.940]   that's where it's going to go.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.340]   I just think the regulatory capture is bad.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.340]   So whenever you have it, you've got to run far, far away
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.020]   from it.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.140]   Basically, this is what we do at Poker.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.180]   All day.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.300]   Gurley, you put a pin in it.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.220]   What's the solution?
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:30.900]   What can we do?
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.980]   I figured you'd go there.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.300]   You know, the first thing--
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   Is politics an answer?
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.420]   The thing that's actionable, from my point of view,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.340]   is just massive transparency.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.500]   So I'd love to see what OpenSecrets does
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.060]   be kind of mandated and way more transparent.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.460]   Like, the minute a check lands, everyone knows.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.260]   Put it on Twitter.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:53.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.060]   Exit.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.180]   Yeah, whatever, right?
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.580]   Expose the hell out of it.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.980]   Because there's a lot of--
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.780]   those meetings I had don't show up as tropos.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.980]   They show up as all those people.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.180]   There's a lot of obfuscation that's out there.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.060]   I think that one's potentially solvable.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.660]   That was really the only thing I thought
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.740]   blockchain could handle.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.140]   But anyway, that's just a side.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.620]   It gets trickier--
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.340]   Poor Brian was watching you, by the way.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.060]   It gets trickier after that.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.860]   One, you guys talked about, Christy,
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.360]   with this when you're talking about the military industrial
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.860]   complex.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.820]   This rotating door thing is a massive problem.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.420]   If you study, there are tons and tons
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.500]   of senators, presidential candidates,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.940]   that are in the Senate.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.380]   They're out for two years.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.660]   And then they come back with $12 million in their pocket.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.260]   And that's happening all over Washington all the time.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.420]   And I don't know how--
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.220]   and Christy said it's impossible,
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.340]   because they'd have to vote to stop this on their own.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.220]   And I think Citizens United should go away.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.540]   But it requires--
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.900]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.380]   It requires the same vote.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.580]   And Gurley, is the existing regulatory capture,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.140]   like entropy, it only goes in one direction?
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.300]   Or is it feasible to unwind?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.140]   It feels that way.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.980]   I mean, one of the candidates you had on, or maybe two,
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.900]   were talking about shutting down stuff.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.220]   That ONC got shut down, which is actually
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.020]   kind of unusual and nice.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.180]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.020]   I don't know.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.420]   I don't see-- there have been attempts
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:27.740]   with certain presidents well in the past of deregulating.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.700]   But even if that's done by the regulators,
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.500]   I'm not even sure that will--
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.820]   How much of-- oh, go ahead, Zach.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.780]   I was going to say, on AI, I think
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.580]   that what was discussed at that hearing that Sam Altman
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.540]   testified at, I think it's an existential threat
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.260]   to Silicon Valley.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.060]   Because what Sam proposed was, well, we
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.220]   should have a new regulatory agency,
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.340]   kind of like the Atomic Energy Commission.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.100]   And we should have standards before AI software
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   can get released and it gets vetted.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.180]   And we'll help you write the standards.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.500]   You remember all this?
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.980]   And the reaction--
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.580]   With pleasure.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.220]   And the reaction of the politicians--
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.500]   I remember all these senators were saying, wow,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.540]   this is such a nice young man.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.660]   This is not like the other tech CEOs
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.940]   who've been testifying up here, basically defying us.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.340]   How do we work with this person?
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.260]   And they were saying all these nice things about him.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.580]   But the reason why I think this is an existential threat
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.820]   is because the cutting edge of all software development
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.900]   right now is AI.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.740]   You look at what every software company is doing,
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.100]   AI is now part of their roadmaps.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.820]   So if you subject AI to regulation,
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.500]   you're basically turning software
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.900]   into the next big pharma or into the next military industrial
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.060]   complex.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.380]   Washington will run the software industry.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.500]   And everything we do in terms of funding
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   these little startups, these companies with fresh ideas,
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.340]   it'll just be over.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.100]   The government's going to do a code review.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.980]   There's no VC industry.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.060]   Well, that's similar to what happened with that--
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.500]   there was an Excel spreadsheet in that EHR example
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.900]   of the features you had to have in your product.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.460]   Can you imagine the government mandating
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.780]   features of a software product?
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   I got some product managers going to Washington,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.020]   getting approval for what they add to the product.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.580]   Another answer might be just to your original question, Dave,
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.460]   is just awareness.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.300]   So getting people more aware and hopefully
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.260]   this kind of thing can help.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.340]   I think knowing what committees your legislators are on
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.220]   and when they're traveling to visit other states
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.140]   and other companies and stuff that
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.860]   have nothing to do with your local situation
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.380]   they're supposed to be looking after, that'd be helpful.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.340]   But once again, the people that would choose--
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.540]   I think it's just the nature--
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.140]   --to mandate this are the ones doing it.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.740]   Is it just the nature of government
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.860]   that it has to scale with time?
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.820]   Because we all think about the government
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.380]   sitting outside of a market.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.220]   But the government is a player in the market.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.700]   They consume capital and they distribute capital.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.260]   And the US federal government now
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.940]   is the largest consumer and distributor
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.860]   of capital in the history of humankind,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.100]   of our civilization.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.820]   I fear-- and you had Dalio's charts of decline--
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.900]   I fear that this is one of those things
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.580]   that causes the decline.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.020]   And I fear that democracy and capitalism
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.540]   will kill each other over time for this very reason.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.340]   I might point that we study the UK a little bit more.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.260]   They've kind of gone longer than most societies do.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.660]   They have some clever policies like losing party
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:35.180]   pays, which causes 1/10 of the litigation that we have.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.940]   And so I wonder if there's something
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.900]   to learn from our previous ancestors.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.380]   The thing when you dip your toe into that world that
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.740]   is shocking is how low the threshold is of the dollars
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.260]   it takes to actually influence hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   of laws getting written.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.180]   And that's where you also see some of this wrong-mindedness.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.260]   Because you can get any Tom, Dick, and Harry
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.500]   to cobble together enough money to get
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.740]   in front of that senator or that congressperson.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.740]   And all of a sudden, you see it reflected in law.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.500]   It's shocking, actually.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.860]   I was talking-- some of you know David Crane, who's
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.220]   an operative in California helping people
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.260]   try and get things done.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.020]   And I asked him about this.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.700]   And he said the one thing you have to keep in mind
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.300]   is the duration of how long that person's going to be there.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.260]   So if someone from Silicon Valley has a problem,
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.740]   they run to Washington.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.460]   And they think-- they get one meeting.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.500]   But are they coming back?
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.660]   The teachers union is going to be there for 100 years.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.380]   So if you cozy up to them, it's forever.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.620]   It's forever money.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   Why do you do this, personally?
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.420]   Why do I do this?
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.580]   Just frustrated.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.620]   Like, just--
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.580]   You're mad as hell.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.220]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.980]   Andrew's a powerful--
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.660]   I mean, you know, you've worked on this for a while,
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.980]   this presentation.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.940]   I saw an early draft.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.220]   It was clearly coming together.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.460]   It's something you've been thinking about a long time.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.380]   A long time.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.180]   I've kept notes on it for 15 years
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.980]   every time I see something, I write it down.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.340]   And you're at a point in your life now where--
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.060]   Oh, that's true.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.860]   Yeah, like, I probably can't get a meeting in Washington.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.940]   I mean--
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.900]   I have trouble with investment banks also.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.940]   You saw the guys before talking about energy.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.900]   It's a huge industry.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.620]   There's enormous amounts of regulatory capture
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.460]   and lots of manipulation of laws in that sector.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.140]   From that perspective and that lens,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.300]   are you pro-fusion and the possibilities of fusion?
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.260]   Not less, but less technologically, more--
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.820]   Yeah, well, not just fusion, but fission.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.940]   I just retweeted something like an hour ago.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.340]   Apparently, they're going to--
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.300]   one of the plant-- one of the fission plants that's
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.100]   been shut down in America, they just voted to reinstate,
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.020]   which is a great--
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:58.740]   Progress.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.460]   --great progress.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.340]   They turned around the anti-nuclear sentiment
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.860]   in what, five years, it seems like?
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.420]   Hopefully, but it's a long way to go,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.260]   because one of the reasons fission's so expensive
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.220]   in the US and way more expensive than China
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.540]   is the regulatory burden--
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.040]   Exactly.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.660]   --that we have.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.580]   China's building 400 nuclear fission power plants right now.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.540]   That's their plan.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.140]   That's their 20-year plan.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.260]   And it's not just in China.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.260]   And if you look at the antigen testing,
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.460]   imagine with the complexity of--
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.340]   Well, no, but this is what I want to ask you.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.860]   It's like, you know, these large energy generators,
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.340]   the existing utilities, what is their
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.260]   incentive to not try to pull a Comcast when they see Bob
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.020]   and David close to the finish line?
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.660]   Oh, you have to imagine that the oil and gas industry's
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.140]   been doing that this whole way.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.820]   I would assume--
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.860]   For traditional nuclear, yeah.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.140]   Yeah, for traditional nuclear.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.900]   Yeah, so I would--
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.860]   This time, we'll see them coming.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.620]   I wonder-- and I say this with a lot of need to tell you--
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.980]   I wonder if you could use open source around fission
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.740]   to try and lower the cost of building it
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.980]   and try and get more consistency--
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.780]   Well, the big Achilles heel in energy,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.340]   as an example, where it's impossible to capture
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.980]   regulatorily, is that the big opening they left
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.780]   is that every individual here can become their own utility.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.020]   And they're subject to no oversight.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.820]   And so the real question is, to your point,
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.300]   if an open source or some very small modular reactor
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   can be put in the hands of every individual,
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.920]   and then they can make an individual decision,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.120]   that's very hard to regulate.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.000]   But in the solar market, which I know you've
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.380]   spent a lot of time in, the rules on whether or not
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.740]   you can run power back in and at what rate
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.540]   are arbitrary across the entire country.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.700]   Guys, I know I speak for everyone
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.980]   when I say that this has been an unbelievable highlight
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   and a real treat.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.620]   Bill, thank you so much for doing this.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.380]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.380]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.380]   Bill, do it.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.880]   Wow.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.380]   Wow.

[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:25.460]   What your winner slide? What your winner slide?
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.500]   Festives are gone.
