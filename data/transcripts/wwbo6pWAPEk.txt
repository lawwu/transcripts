[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.080]   and joining us is Andre Oliveira.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.160]   Andre, how you doing?
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.400]   - Hey Tim, doing well and you,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.360]   thank you so much for having me.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.400]   - Yeah, you know, you and I have worked a lot in the past,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.440]   but maybe just get us started,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.640]   like what is it you're doing,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.600]   and what are you doing at Pixel Matters?
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680]   - Yeah, so we are a digital product studio.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.800]   We basically partner with tech companies
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   from all over the world,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   but especially U.S. based to basically
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.480]   to elevate their products into a whole new level,
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.360]   being a website, a web app, or a mobile app.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.760]   And yeah, we have been doing it for 10 years now.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.960]   We are roughly a team of 60,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.680]   we try to differentiate ourselves
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.000]   by the level of quality of the work,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.160]   and process, and communication that we have,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.800]   and our culture around all of those things.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.640]   - Cool, and I probably should have introduced
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.480]   even better earlier,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.640]   you're the CEO and founder of Pixel Matters,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.360]   and Andrei, I'm kind of curious,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.720]   did you, were you always creative?
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.560]   Like coming out of school, like what led you here?
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.200]   - Yeah, so to answer that,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.400]   I maybe have to go back to my roots.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.200]   So I don't know about,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   I'm not sure how it is in the U.S.,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.880]   but here in Portugal, where I'm from,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   and where we are based,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.080]   when you are at the ninth grade,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   and before you switch to the 10th,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.160]   you have to basically pick like a course, right?
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.640]   Like something to study.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.880]   And back then, as the majority of the kids of that age,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.800]   maybe 14, 15, something like that,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   I really didn't knew what I wanted to do for my life.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.280]   Like I was too young,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.320]   and sometimes school doesn't necessarily
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   like gives you a good indicator of what your path may be.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.040]   So the only thing that really I valued back then
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.720]   was the fact, or I highlighted back then,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.000]   was the fact that I had like a whole computer
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.400]   in which I played some games like Counter-Strike.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   - Oh yeah.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.320]   - Call of Duty, things like that, you know?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.200]   - Yes.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   - And so it felt like, I'm not studying informatics.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.760]   And I went on to study informatics.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.480]   I did the 10th grade of informatics,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.520]   but the problem was that it had too much code.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   Like, and it was too much math to my brain,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   let's call it that way.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.920]   And so I switched to a multimedia course,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   not because I knew what I wanted to do,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   but simply I had a friend that switched to that same course,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.520]   and I wanted like to keep studying with that friend.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.360]   So these are like the, I mean,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480]   there is luck along the way, right?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720]   Of course, there is a lot of hard work,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600]   but there is also some luck,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.960]   and this is an example of that.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.600]   And so with that multimedia course,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.240]   what I basically found out was my passion.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   And my passion was clearly, and still is to this day,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.760]   like the digital design, like UX, UI in particular.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.720]   So I really try to specialize
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   and to know as much as I possibly could about that.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.920]   And so after a period of unemployment after the school,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   I eventually found out my first job, my second job.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.840]   Then I started working as a freelancer,
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.240]   like and I received some inquiries via Dribbble,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.160]   BS, and websites of that kind.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.440]   And one day the inquiries started to pile up,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.320]   like then referrals, like a client brings another client,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.440]   a client brings another client.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760]   And so before I could even think twice about it,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.480]   I have an open business and I have like people working
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.200]   with me in my apartment.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.360]   So I'm trying to consolidate it
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.680]   as in the most succinct way I possibly can.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   - Yeah, you know, that's very consistent actually
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.280]   with even my impression of you,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.800]   'cause you're talking about building relationship through,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.480]   I mean, building business through relationships, right?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   And through referrals.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.680]   And that's exactly the first impression I had with you
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.360]   as well, like your strength in building relationship
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.240]   with clients through good work and building rapport
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.320]   and honesty is really, I feel like what differentiates you
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.080]   with a lot of the other, even at an individual level,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.760]   not even just at a company level, like you as an individual,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   'cause a lot of times we engage with a service provider
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.760]   or whatever, based on the first interaction
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.040]   with the first rep, right?
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.880]   And that individual carries with them the burden
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   of representing the whole brand.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   And if that's a bad experience,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.720]   you kind of don't wanna do work with them.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.840]   So can you help me understand?
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   So all right, you got folks in your living room
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.680]   and taking the leap from that to, I guess,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   incorporating or creating Pixel Matters,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.160]   like did you have the name Pixel Matters
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.680]   or did it come afterwards?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.320]   Like how did this all come about?
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.080]   - No, we have the name Pixel Matters
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.320]   from the very beginning.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.440]   So I have a friend that started the business
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.720]   with me in the early days.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.200]   He left in the meantime,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.560]   but the company was incorporated as like a 50/50.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.040]   And back then, I remember we were just like brainstorming
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.200]   on Skype.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   This is like 2012 or 2013, something like that.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.880]   And we were like combining words, you know?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.720]   And there was a moment in which we combined Pixel Matters
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.760]   and we both felt, oh, this one will be amazing.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.480]   And I remember Googling and because I was expecting
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.960]   like something to exist with the name Pixel Matters,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.640]   to my like surprise, nothing existed.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.040]   And we were like, okay, this is it.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.560]   This is the name, let's go for it.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   We opened it up the entity on December 17, 2013.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.280]   And the motivation for it was the fact
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   that we have a big client that appeared
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.800]   into our front door, a client from Ghana.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.320]   It was the only client ever we ever had from Africa,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.560]   but it was clearly an important one
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   in which we basically estimated the project
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.120]   into like 20K or 25K,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.160]   which was like an enormous amount of money.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.880]   And none of us were like comfortable to receive
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.120]   that amount into our own personal bank accounts
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   without like a proper justification, you know?
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.800]   And so that was like the catalyst,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.240]   let's call it that way, to open up the entity.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   And from that point onwards, yeah,
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.120]   the business just kept on evolving like organically.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.320]   We are completely different from the usual companies
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.360]   that we work with as our clients
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.560]   and the companies that you work with
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.960]   at least in the recent years as well,
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.480]   in the sense that we are like old fashioned, you know?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.320]   It's like, I own 100% of the business.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.720]   We have no investors.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.040]   We are profitable nearly every month,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520]   otherwise like there will be no business.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   And so it's a simple structure from that perspective.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.520]   I don't know if I answered your question.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.640]   - No, you did, yeah.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.400]   Yeah, you know, I don't know if I ever told you, Andre,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   I've always really liked the name Pixel Matters
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.880]   because I have, so as a digital marketer,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.480]   I have a very specific phrase
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.040]   I use almost at every single job I join,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.760]   and that is that every pixel has to have a purpose.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.240]   You know, like- - There you go.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.760]   - Coming from the agency side,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440]   clients are always saying,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.840]   "Oh, build it like Apple, build it."
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.720]   It's like, yes, Apple has a wonderful site.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.360]   It's true and it's beautiful.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.840]   There's a lot of analytics behind that
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.040]   which you don't have visibility into.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.480]   So just copying it, you know,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.440]   or Stripe, beautiful website as well.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.840]   You just can't copy it
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.160]   if you don't know what's really working
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.000]   'cause you don't have the data.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.760]   And so like, you can't just arbitrarily
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.640]   throw colors on a page.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.000]   So yeah, for me, it's like every pixel
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.600]   has to be put there intentionally.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.960]   If it's not, get it out of there. (laughs)
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   No, I don't remember you saying that,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.080]   at least not in that way.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.640]   So yeah, yeah, thanks, appreciate it.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.280]   But yeah, indeed, Modesty aside,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   it's really a name that has served us well
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.880]   because it kind of facilitates the pitch.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.280]   Like the company name kind of says
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   like 75% of the whole idea we want to convey
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.680]   to a potential client.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.040]   So yeah, so just to touch on the relationship point,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   because I missed that part just a while ago,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.400]   that is to say that, I mean,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.240]   I'm glad that that's something that comes across,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.800]   at least for someone like you
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.720]   that has worked with us in the past,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   because I think that at the very foundation of that
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.560]   is a relatively simple like idea and concept,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.200]   which is the fact that we,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.280]   like I never propose of myself to create a company
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.400]   or in this case, an agency,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.040]   just for the sake of like billing man hours, you know?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.360]   I did it with the intention to try to do work
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.160]   that really has an impact on the client business,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.000]   in whatever form that may be,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.640]   but to really have an impact
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.200]   instead of just doing it for the sake of doing it
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.120]   or doing for the sake of receiving
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.000]   some financial upside in exchange.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.600]   And because of that, even when you aren't the client yet,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   like even if you are a lead,
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.560]   our approach is always like help first,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.680]   sell secondly, you know?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.200]   So the sale is always like secondary.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.280]   And because, I mean, to me,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   that is the only way in which it makes sense,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.960]   always with the mindset of like playing the long game
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.840]   instead of like looking for short-term gains.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.280]   - Yeah, you know, I'm kind of wondering,
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.440]   so you're uniquely positioned in this call,
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.600]   I see amongst everyone I've talked to so far,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.360]   because you are an international firm, right?
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.040]   Because everyone I've been speaking to so far
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.920]   has been very stateside.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.480]   And when we're evaluating design partners or whatnot,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.920]   like especially in today's climate,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.760]   like budget becomes a really important thing.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.240]   And so if it's not an internal headcount,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   choosing to do business with a stateside firm
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.320]   could be an expensive prospect, right?
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.880]   And usually the argument for staying stateside is like,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.600]   oh, you know, maybe they're in the same time zone
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.160]   or whatever it is, or maybe they're close to us
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.440]   and do in-person meetings.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.560]   But I'm finding that that reason
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.280]   is starting to become a lot less important than cost,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.200]   only 'cause in this climate right now,
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.840]   like companies are just struggling,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   they're just trying to stay alive
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.480]   'cause the economy is so crazy.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.360]   So it's opened the door more
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.280]   to working with international firms.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   So I'm kind of curious on your side,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.680]   like how do you,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   I think building relationships obviously is one way
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.400]   of kind of creating state US-based customers,
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.280]   but is that an intentional strategy of yours?
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.800]   Is the majority of your customers
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.320]   still based out of Portugal?
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.200]   And what are the challenges you faced?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.520]   Time zone is probably one of them,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.880]   but working with customers who are not in Portugal,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   not local, what challenges do you face?
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:40.520]   - Like historically, roughly 90 to 90% of our revenue
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.520]   comes from US-based companies.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.400]   So we do have a few local like Portuguese clients,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   but we are talking about like 5 to 10% in annual revenue
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.480]   over all these years.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.240]   So it's not very relevant.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.640]   So yeah, we have been dealing
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.640]   with this kind of remote collaboration for 10 years now.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   I think the value prop that we try to offer to our clients,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.960]   and actually I've been on a call with a lead,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.200]   like a potential client that said this almost
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.040]   with using the same exact words,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.760]   which is we try to position ourselves in a way
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   that we provide a value of the same level of quality
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.720]   that the US-based agency does,
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.600]   but for a fraction of the cost.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   While not being the cheapest option
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.760]   that you find like in the market, right?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.240]   Because obviously the cost of living
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.920]   and the cost of employment and goods and whatever in Portugal
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.280]   is quite different from other places in the world.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.800]   So, and we don't want to compete in price anyway.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.560]   So that's the kind of sweet spot
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.640]   that we try to position ourselves.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   - In addition to this, I would say that the pandemic
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.440]   and the change that happened in the work paradigm
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.200]   really, really made the difference.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.760]   Because what I found these days is that
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.880]   everyone is kind of distributive anyways, you know?
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.880]   So very few companies are like office driven
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.240]   like they were before the pandemic,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   especially the bigger ones.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.520]   Like the bigger you are, the harder it gets
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.600]   to have an approach to that kind.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.680]   So everyone is already like deal,
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.000]   user to deal with the time zone difference,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.680]   the need for a sync communication,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.080]   the need to have like documented processes
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.040]   or, you know, like some basics
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.240]   for a remote collaboration to go well.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.520]   That partnering with someone that is overseas,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.320]   that is indeed on a different time zone,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.920]   it's really not something that like matters
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   as long as the work is done and with quality
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.760]   and the relationship is good.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.480]   So that's what I find.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.640]   That doesn't mean that we are not feeling the impact
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.960]   of the current market.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.440]   Those are two different things because yeah,
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.240]   things are wrong out there.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I definitely wanna talk
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.360]   about surviving the pandemic,
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.040]   but before I get there, I'm kind of curious, you know,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.920]   you said something that I didn't even think about,
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   which is, you know, the community that you work with,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.560]   they're either a custom or have experience working
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.760]   with very remote, different time zone customers, right?
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.400]   And so I was wondering, you know,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.760]   because the time zones are so different,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   oftentimes I'm working with, for me, an offshore team,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.520]   the value of not having the same time zone
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.240]   is by the time you get into work,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.400]   the work that you need to get completed is already done,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.640]   right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.240]   - But then there's always time for feedback.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.720]   And depending on the resource type, right?
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   Like design, it's more, you can mostly package and hand off,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.360]   but like when we're doing development work,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.560]   sometimes that requires us to be online
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.600]   at the same time, right?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.280]   And so, is it hard for you to, you know,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.480]   find the resources who are willing to work
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.520]   like US-based hours or how do you meet the middle?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:41.640]   - I mean, I guess we are lucky in the sense
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.160]   that all of our team is in Portugal
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.960]   and we in Portugal are in a very like central place
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.720]   of the world and like looking at the US,
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.840]   even if you are in like California, like you are,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.960]   we still manage to have at least a daily overlap
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.640]   of time of two to three hours.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.520]   And not only because of the time zone difference,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.200]   but also because the fact that usually like Americans
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.120]   like yourself get up like quite early,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.760]   which is for us great because if you got out of bed
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.440]   at 10 a.m., things will be different.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.880]   So I guess with the combination of luck,
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.280]   which is the context that I just described
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.360]   and the fact that we have a process that is very well oiled,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.400]   we have the right communication tools in place,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.320]   things just work well.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.920]   And I can tell you that apart from a few exceptions
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.240]   over the years, we never felt the need, for example,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.160]   to adjust our schedule to, let's imagine like having
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.840]   our team starting to work at 11 in the morning
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.720]   or noon or something like that.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   That never happened simply because like
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.160]   it was never needed, right?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.480]   So the only thing that happens is like, okay,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.000]   today's lunch day or there is something important,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.320]   let's, we stay longer through the day
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.720]   or we wake up earlier or whatever it may be.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   But always with good sense and looking at what's best
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.080]   for the challenge that is in front of us.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.320]   - Yeah, I'm kind of wondering, beyond the client side,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   I've seen a shift post-pandemic around the need
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.600]   to demonstrate ROI for every dollar spent, right?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.440]   And that manifests itself in different ways, right?
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.120]   For someone like me, who's come from the agency side,
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.360]   I have a little more empathy of the process
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.200]   that you go through.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.680]   And so when it comes to prioritizing the work
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.280]   and working with a partner like you,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   like I do a lot of upfront work to make sure
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.240]   you're set for success, which sets me up for success.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   But I don't see that all across the board.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   I see a lot of frantic planning,
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.640]   where budgets are cut.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.400]   Now you need to squeeze as much as you can out of it.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.360]   And from what I observed, and this is not just,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.480]   and not my current company, but my previous companies,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.160]   and actually from stories I hear from other friends as well,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.000]   is that because you demonstrate that ROI,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.240]   the focus of what you send the agency partner down
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.680]   becomes more vague.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.360]   They just ask a lot, ask a lot, ask a lot,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   trying to squeeze as much lemonade out of the lemons,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.200]   which is a decreasing budget.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.080]   Have you noticed that shift as well,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   in terms of how clients work with you,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.840]   how they speak to you?
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.160]   Do you feel like you're treated more
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.120]   as a commodity now than before?
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.680]   Or anything of that nature?
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.840]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:09.200]   I think the change that we have felt,
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.880]   timing-wise, was not in the pandemic.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.000]   So basically what we felt in the pandemic
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.120]   was like a V recovery,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.360]   in the sense that in March 2020, April 2020,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.880]   the world was in shock, and everyone went crazy,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   and there was like a stock market crash,
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.800]   and everyone was like, what the hell is this thing?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.680]   And now we have to be closer at home.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.920]   And so there was like a panic going on.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.920]   But immediately afterwards,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.480]   what followed was like a growth
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   in all companies that have like a digital offering
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   of something that is usually done offline,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.840]   like online education.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.000]   Even Zoom, where we are right now,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.280]   grew like crazy over the months that followed,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.000]   because suddenly every grandma in the US
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.680]   was doing a Zoom call with their kids
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.600]   almost on a daily basis.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.440]   And so it was like a drop, and we felt that,
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.880]   but the market recovered very rapidly,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   and 2021 and 2022 have been like way better years
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.760]   from a financial and economic standpoint in tech,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.880]   not necessarily in the rest of the world,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.720]   but in tech it was...
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   In fact, in 2021, at least that's my reading,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.560]   it was like the top of the bubble
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.520]   that exploded in the meantime.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   So that said, what I think that really changed
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.160]   was like in late 2022, early 2023,
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.400]   where the tech market correction really started
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.080]   to be felt and all the layoffs,
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.320]   and I mean, all those things,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.400]   that's where what you just described
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.800]   really started to play a big part
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.280]   at the negotiation table.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   Like, I'm not sure if the right way to put it is ROI.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   To me, it's more like the money is no longer cheap,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   and so therefore the cost of a dollar
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.920]   is way bigger than it was before.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   And so companies, even though they still have the cash,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.760]   they don't have like the openness to invest that cash,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   and it's way harder to get those budgets
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.440]   to be invested on whatever it may be.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   In our case, it's a service.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.920]   So definitely like a big change
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.600]   and really, really challenging times right now
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.640]   that I think everyone in the industry is feeling,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.400]   and we are not an exception.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   Regarding us being like a commodity,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.960]   I think that part, it's not really something
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   that I can say that, yes, we felt that, no,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.040]   because the type of service that we provide
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.280]   is usually very attached
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.640]   to the long-term success of the business.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.440]   I will give like a simple example.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   Let's say that we are working on the revamp of your product,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.320]   like your company has a very outdated product,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.520]   users complain, or they don't understand how to use it,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   so there are UX problems, your UI is a complete mess,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.040]   you have no like digital identity, right?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.320]   And so there is a need to clean all that up.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   In the tech front, like your backend is a mess
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.800]   or your frontend is completely outdated,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.440]   and there is a need to revamp everything.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.600]   And so when we are working on those type of projects
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.920]   that are so close to the heart of the business,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.680]   definitely we are not like a commodity,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.880]   and that's where we feel like we want to,
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.720]   we are more valuable at,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.560]   and that's where our clients value us the most.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.440]   When we are working on something
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.440]   that is like more like a side priority to the business,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.720]   that's where usually the sentence comes,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.440]   something in the line of,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.520]   "Oh, Pixelmatrix is the most expensive line item
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.040]   "I have on my spreadsheet,
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.920]   "so I have to cut somewhere, it will be on you."
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:10.840]   So that's more or less how I would put it.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.400]   But it will be very interesting to listen
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.760]   also what you think about these changes.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.280]   - You know, it's interesting to me your last statement,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.600]   which is Pixelmatter is being the most expensive line item,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.480]   that hasn't been my experience
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.760]   with your agency in particular.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.440]   So typically, just for everyone out there, right?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.040]   When you're, there's always the three factors
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.600]   of like speed, quality, cost.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.960]   And the rule of thumb is you usually can't have all three.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.840]   You can have two at the sacrifice of one, right?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   So you can have speed and cost, but quality could be down.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.600]   Or you can have, take your time with high quality,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.960]   but the cost would be high, right?
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.080]   But like Pixelmatter is in my experience,
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.040]   and this is a huge kind of shout out to you guys,
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.280]   you somehow, in my mind, managed to achieve all three.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.160]   Meaning the cost compared to the rates
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.880]   of US-based companies is advantageous, right?
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.360]   The quality of output is always really, really good.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.920]   And you somehow deliver it quickly.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.880]   I remember in the past when evaluating vendors,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.160]   all the time working with you even,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.120]   or trying to bring you on as I move companies myself,
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.800]   what I've discovered is rate for rate
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.400]   versus quality of talent,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.920]   that's where you start feeling the difference, right?
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.720]   Like if you try and compare to a US-based company,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.440]   and they try to match the rate that you guys are doing,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   because you're offshore, it's about location, right?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.200]   Now you're comparing a junior talent
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.880]   versus a mid to senior level talent, just based on budget.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.200]   So for me, choosing not to do business with Pixelmatters
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.000]   isn't because you're the most expensive line item.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   What I'm experiencing now is just spending money at all.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.440]   - I have.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.280]   - Yeah, like I come in with an envelope
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.200]   that was healthy this year, and I was like, oh, cool.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.880]   I have a budget spent last year.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.400]   The budget's flat year over year.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.200]   I just got to spend it again.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.400]   My team overachieved last year.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.160]   So far, it's looking like it's doing that again.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.680]   So I was like, cool, like conventional wisdom would be like,
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.040]   let me just at least invest in the same areas,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.840]   and maybe it'll grow, or maybe, or whatnot.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.040]   But I'm finding right now that even though I have a budget,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.400]   getting it approved to be spent is something else.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.120]   And even if I come to the table and say,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.600]   hey, look, I have all the metrics to prove ROI on the spend,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.640]   why it's strategically aligned to the business priorities,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.360]   as well as my own organization's priorities and the yield,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.760]   even then it's a tough sell.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.320]   And I can understand.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.640]   The trade-off is, are you gonna spend 50K
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.840]   in one area of the business,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.920]   or is that gonna go towards keeping someone's employed?
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.400]   So I understand the trade-offs that companies make,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.320]   as well as protecting company value and stock price.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.520]   So I get that, but the climate is just so weird, man.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.440]   And there's things that are just table stakes
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.560]   that I would think should be a no-brainer,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   and it's just requiring a little bit more scrutiny than usual.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:34.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm happy to listen to what you just said,
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.520]   and I think it will be interesting for folks
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.320]   that are listening to this,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   especially folks that are on my shoes.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.520]   And I know that because of all the community local
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.280]   that I have, there will be, for sure,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.440]   a lot of other founders from agencies
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.160]   that will listen to the pod,
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.600]   because what you just described
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.280]   is exactly what I'm feeling.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.760]   The money is there.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.120]   The willingness to spend the money doesn't exist,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.080]   which is what you just said.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   And so it's a very weird moment in time,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.400]   because you question yourself,
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.920]   what can you do to change things around
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.560]   and to start to close lids and all of that?
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:27.440]   And it's tough, because even if you arrive
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   into the front door of the right clients,
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.360]   if they aren't willing to invest
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   and to spend the money, what can you do?
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.440]   So I don't know if you have any tips for me,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.120]   but it feels a bit, yeah,
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.600]   I'm not sure what to do regarding that,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.640]   other than keeping investing in the quality of the work,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.840]   the processes, the team, the brand,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.480]   and preparing ourselves for a recovery.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.120]   - Yeah, the path I'm taking right now,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.800]   and you're a part of this journey as well,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.760]   'cause you and I obviously we talk a lot
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.000]   and you were sounding board for one another,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.080]   or trying to create opportunity with each other.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.440]   I came in this year with the original thought
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.880]   that, hey, I can just translate my budget year over year.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   And so it was a large line item,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.120]   and it was quickly dismissed.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.800]   So I'm doing a different method now,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.240]   where it's like, I need to prove, first of all,
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.080]   that I'm maximizing utilization of internal resources,
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.560]   'cause that's gonna be the very first things
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.080]   that come to mind.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   We have designers in-house,
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.080]   we don't want them to be impacted,
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.120]   so make sure they're fully utilized,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.880]   even if it's utilized in a way
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.240]   that falls outside their comfort zone, right?
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   They're a designer,
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.200]   they're not typical UX/UI web designers,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.360]   but can you make it work?
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.080]   And as a leader, I need to figure out
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.760]   where that skillset can fit in
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.840]   without negative impacting anybody.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.920]   So my approach now, and I'm still working on it, Andre,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.200]   is going the other way around,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.280]   which is like, let's start small.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.720]   And small means different things
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.640]   to different businesses, right?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.720]   For startups, small could be a $5,000 engagement.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.160]   For a large company, small could be $50,000 or more.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.400]   It's totally different.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.920]   But the idea is like taking something,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.400]   maybe like two or three key priority projects,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.000]   and just starting there to prove value, right?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.840]   And so that's what I'm trying to do now,
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.720]   and it's across the board,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.560]   whether it's a technology investment,
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.840]   or a service investment,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.800]   I'm just trying to get it in there.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.400]   And once the spend is in there,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.760]   you're in the system, and you're proving work,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.000]   people can then see, right?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.400]   So again, it's just a different model.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.200]   And in this case, it's bringing on a new relationship,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.240]   like I'm actively talking to you,
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.520]   trying to see if we can do some work, right?
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.920]   But even with existing vendors,
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   it's surprisingly going through the same level.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.000]   Yeah, I also felt that right now,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.920]   I'm not feeling that very heavily,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.360]   but with like the boom of AI,
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.480]   and I mean, of course,
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.720]   ChatGPT has been like the key milestone,
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.800]   but obviously a lot more has been happening,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.880]   and being launched ever since.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   I also felt that like the expectations from clients
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.200]   regarding how much time things take to be done,
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   really like changed dramatically on, not right now,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.440]   I think now things are a little bit more stabilized,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.240]   and everyone kind of realized that AI,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.520]   at least for now, won't do all the work for you.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.760]   But in the, like half a year ago, or something like that,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   we really felt that change in people's expectations,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   and the perception of how much something takes to be done.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.600]   Like I had CMOs telling me like,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.640]   "Andrei, how much time do you think
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   that like five pages take to be done?"
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.800]   I'm asking because my CEO says that now with AI,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.120]   and Webflow, it should take three days.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.360]   And I was like, "Am I missing something?"
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   Or, you know, and so there was like a big,
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.640]   as if the market economic correction wasn't enough,
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.240]   AI also brought some more pressure to the table,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.280]   because you are now supposed to be more efficient,
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.160]   more like, more productive, faster.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.880]   And I'm not saying this meaning
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.280]   that we are ignoring the change, no.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.200]   But the change is like progressive, you know,
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.240]   it's not something that from one day to the other,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   you cut something that will,
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.560]   before chat GPT will take one year,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.320]   and now you can make it into two weeks.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.520]   It's not really like that, so.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.800]   - Yeah, this has come up for me as well.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.040]   And the way I kind of help educate people
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   is AI is definitely here, it requires a conductor.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.440]   So AI can only do so much as it's being inputted.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.160]   And so usually when I have this conversation,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.960]   I was like, "Look, the strategy piece
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.040]   "can't be replicated by AI."
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.920]   So you're coming in and setting groundwork.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.000]   Now, once you inform the AI, it can augment work.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   So for example, like we're like,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   for Adobe, Adobe Firefly, right?
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.960]   They're kind of embedding design capabilities.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.360]   And actually even with Adobe,
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.320]   they're introducing like Gen AI.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.400]   And they have this thing where,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.080]   based on the algorithms they have,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.520]   they can do things like instantaneously
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.480]   grabbing from a library of images.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.840]   Of course, they have a lot of stock images, right?
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.160]   They can do a thing where,
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.960]   let's say you're doing a webpage,
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.480]   and it can automate iterations of an image
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.720]   like 100 times within like a week.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   And it can iterate, iterate,
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.640]   and then automatically self-select to a winner.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.480]   Great.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.280]   The quality of those images are questionable, right?
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.440]   But again, there is value in automation,
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.560]   but it can't replace a strategy of it.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.440]   And so that's where I go back to like,
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.120]   anyone who's trying to do this is like,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.040]   you need to think through like how you're going to use the AI
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.280]   and that requires a human.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.000]   But AI will augment the work, right?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.320]   And so there are,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.760]   but I don't think we're at the place yet,
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.840]   and we might be soon,
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.800]   where the AI cuts quality of work.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.400]   I think it allows you to iterate quicker,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.960]   but those iterations are also,
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.720]   they're not always ready for final production though.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.480]   So it just allows you to speed up
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.960]   your brainstorming process possibly.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.200]   But like, I have so much respect
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.880]   for like creatives and developers.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.680]   There's some things you just can't take shortcuts on.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.240]   And actually I feel developers
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.280]   probably feel the AI crunch even more,
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.200]   'cause AI can actually spit out code now, right?
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.400]   And it's a lot more data driven
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.440]   and a lot less subjective than creative.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.760]   So those folks, for my developer friends,
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.840]   they're really feeling it.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.880]   They're like, people coming out of college right now,
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.240]   they can just spit in the code
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.920]   and then kick out a package.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.720]   And like, yeah, that's hard.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.560]   - Yeah.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.880]   No, yeah, it's a multiplier of productivity,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.320]   but I think you put it out well
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.080]   in the sense that if you don't know what you want to do
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.800]   or what type of outcome you are looking for,
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.240]   AI won't make it up for you.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.480]   So there is also always some level of thought
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.440]   that needs to go into play.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.920]   One of the sentences I like the most
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   about this AI revolution is AI won't replace you,
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.520]   a person using AI will.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.360]   - Yes.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   - Because I really identify myself
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   with the thinking behind that.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   And I think that's where the things are headed.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.320]   - I think a good example,
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.640]   and I even, I tweeted about that is,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.520]   I don't know if you saw like the Vercel,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.680]   they launched something called V0,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   which is basically, I have access to like a beta
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.840]   or test account or whatever.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.560]   And basically it's a site,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.520]   and you go there and you say,
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.520]   build me like a calendar app for my barbershop, whatever.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.520]   It may be.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   And it literally gives you like a full fledged product
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.440]   that you can then use and take it as your own product.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.840]   And so these things are happening
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.800]   and it's really a revolution.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   I think one of the few like protections
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.360]   that we human beings have from that,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.360]   to avoid all of us to become unemployed,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.080]   all of the sudden is IP.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.520]   Because if I am like an early stage founder
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.520]   and I'm scrapping my ideas and testing an MVP
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.920]   for 10 of my friends or whatever it may be,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.040]   it's totally fine to use that
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.640]   and to use that AI generated code
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   and be dependent on Vercel,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.200]   which is a private business to run my product, right?
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.320]   Like it's fine, I don't have revenue,
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.200]   I'm just testing things out.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.560]   But if I am like a big company
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.840]   listed in the stock exchange or even a smaller one,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.280]   but the company with already some
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.360]   like importance in the market,
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.280]   I can't have a product that depends
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.120]   on another privately owned company.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.320]   And it was generated by AI,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.280]   which in itself already has like concerns
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.640]   regarding the IP of the code that it gets,
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   like there are concerns in the community
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.560]   regarding GitHub Copilot and all of that.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.920]   And so what path do I need to run?
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.560]   I need to build my own product with my own code.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.880]   Maybe AI is used into the mix,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   but it's like just as a facilitator
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.760]   and always reviewed by a human,
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.960]   but I can't afford to have my products
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   being built on top of like Vercel or whatever it may be.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.840]   So I don't know if this makes sense.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.320]   I haven't spoke with too many people about this,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.880]   but it's something that like crossed my mind
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.160]   a few times already.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I definitely know that our company has,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.000]   we are not allowed to use things like ChatDBT
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.560]   because it's aggregating the data
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.920]   and you can't have content risk being made public.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.360]   And now it's public domain, right?
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   And so we're utilizing tools internally that are like that.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.000]   But I remember from my own stuff,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.240]   to your point around people who use AI
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.280]   are better positioned to replace you.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   I totally believe that.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.880]   An example of this would be like,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.120]   I was writing for my own personal projects.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.640]   I was writing some headlines and blogs
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.760]   and someone asked me to help them write like a paragraph.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.400]   Now, normally my research process would be going to Google
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.440]   and like learn as much as I can, right?
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.120]   But I was able to do things like a ChatDBT,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.200]   write me a paragraph about insert topic,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.680]   utilizing these five keywords
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.400]   in the tone of someone who is insert persona,
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.440]   limited to 500 characters for the high-tech space,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.840]   specifically in electronics.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.200]   And it spit me off some people, right?
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.200]   Like the more thought you put into directing the AI,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.320]   the more successful.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.760]   But that's why I say it requires a conductor.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.440]   And that's why AI can't just replace you outright.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.200]   But you're right, if you know how to utilize it,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.800]   then yeah, you're a lot better positioned.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   - There will be people making a lot of money
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.760]   on selling out to make the ultra-right Google prompts.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.800]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.120]   - Right, because the quality of the prompt
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.520]   is extremely important and really has an impact
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.480]   on the output that you get.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.600]   So yeah, I totally understand that.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.920]   At the same time,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.520]   and I don't want to drag this topic so much,
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.480]   but it's so fascinating, right?
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.600]   At the same time, I can tell you that,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.080]   and maybe you have this experience yourself,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.280]   from like a recruitment standpoint,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.760]   we have in our application form,
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.520]   we have like three questions.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.040]   One of them is like, "Why pixel managers?"
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.160]   And "Why you are a fit for the role?"
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.840]   Or one sentence about you, something along those lines.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.760]   And I can tell you that even without using any tool,
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:15.200]   I can immediately like almost smell
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.680]   when someone just copy-pasted or something like that,
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.400]   something from ChatGPT.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   And that is happening right now.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.280]   And so while I understand this is like,
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.920]   it's a phase that we will go through,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   like AI is very, like it's a baby yet for now.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.000]   But what I mean to say with this is that
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.600]   I think that as more people adopt AI,
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.320]   for example, to write,
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.880]   the more valuable it will become
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.480]   to write something like very authentic and genuine
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.000]   and something that really comes from your heart
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.080]   and it's very raw, you know?
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.480]   Because people will notice this wasn't written by a bot.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.520]   So there is that as well.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   It's like an opportunity that to me clearly exists
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.560]   in the midst of all the revolution.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.440]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.280]   And I think just kind of wrapping this up for everyone,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.520]   you know, my key takeaway from this conversation is,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.960]   you know, for a agency going through this climate,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.200]   the quality absolutely matters, right?
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.400]   But I think what differentiates you at the end of the day
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.560]   when you go beyond the dollars and cents
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.000]   is that relationship piece.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.400]   And I think your ability specifically
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.680]   to build that relationship, build that trust,
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.040]   and in some ways, just being a pure sounding board for me,
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.960]   whether we do business or not,
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.480]   is something that echoes very constantly with me, right?
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.320]   And so that's why I'm always thinking about Pixel Matters
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.280]   because of that relationship.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.560]   So maybe that's the only way for now
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.400]   to kind of get through this
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.440]   and we find creative ways of getting, you know,
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.800]   getting foot into the door,
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.480]   but these are things that have lasting impressions
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.440]   on clients.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.880]   So Andre, I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.720]   And I learned a lot from this conversation
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.360]   and look forward to hopefully having you on again
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.480]   and just talking about anything else you want to talk about.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.120]   - Yeah, Tim, thank you so much for having me
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.360]   and you are always so kind and you are right,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.600]   like the relationships really matter.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.280]   And we, whenever we work with someone that we like,
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.640]   like you, we look at the person
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.200]   and not to the role that the person has, you know?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.440]   And so I'm happy that we have stayed in touch
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   during good times, bad times.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.560]   Now we are doing this podcast together.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.480]   So yeah, I really appreciate it for you
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.560]   to give me the opportunity
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   and enjoy, really enjoy the conversation as always.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.880]   - Well, congratulations again
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.280]   on your 10 year anniversary.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.640]   For everyone, pixelmatters.com is where you want to go

[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   - All right, talk to you later.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.700]   you
