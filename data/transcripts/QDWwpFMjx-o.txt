[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.040]   found in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 3 reading verses
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.120]   18, 19, and 20. Verses 18, 19, and 20 in the third chapter of Paul's first epistle to
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.720]   the Corinthians. "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.240]   be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise. For the wisdom
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.160]   of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, 'He taketh the wise in
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   their own craftiness.' And again, 'The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:57.080]   they are vain.' And then he goes on to say, 'Therefore let no man glory in men.'"
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   Now those who were here last Sunday night will recall that we were considering the
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960]   statement recorded in the 11th verse of that chapter where the Apostle says,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.800]   "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ." And
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.920]   then he goes on to say, "Now if any man build upon this foundation gold or
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.680]   silver or precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.840]   manifest. For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire. And
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.480]   which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.800]   be burned, he shall suffer loss. But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.160]   Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.120]   in you? If any men defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.200]   temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." Then comes the word that we are
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.160]   considering tonight, "Let no man deceive himself." If any man among you seemeth to
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.640]   be or thinks that he is wise in this world and in the sense of this world's
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.960]   wisdom, let him become a fool. Let him become what the world regards as a fool,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:32.600]   that he may be made really wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.240]   God. And he then proves that from two Old Testament quotations and ends by saying,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.800]   "Therefore let no man glory in men." Now there is nothing it sometimes seems to me
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.160]   about the modern man which is quite so foolish as the way in which he seems to
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.960]   think. That the conditions in which he finds himself are entirely different
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.080]   from the conditions and the position confronting all mankind hitherto. This is
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.600]   very characteristic of the modern man, that he believes his problems are new
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.560]   problems. Now there is nothing I say that is quite so foolish about the modern
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.720]   anti-Christian point of view as just that. And there is a very simple way in
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.560]   which one can demonstrate it, and that is to say this. If we had no other proof of
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.240]   the fact that men doesn't change essentially, we've got it in this, that
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.720]   men still goes on repeating the same old mistakes as have been committed by men
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.240]   throughout the centuries. If you like that in a more philosophical form you've
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.720]   got it in that adage of Hegel, "We learn from history that we learn nothing from
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.160]   history." We go on repeating the same old mistakes. If that is true more or less in
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.120]   general with respect to men and his conduct in this world, it is particularly
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.280]   true in the matter of his attitude towards this gospel. Now the modern idea
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   is, so many believe this, that they reject this gospel because of these new
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.520]   conditions in which they find themselves. They talk about the changed world in
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.200]   which we live, atomic age, scientific age, that everything is different, that man
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.840]   now has grown up, he has a different view with all the knowledge that he's got,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   that the whole situation is quite different, that whereas this old gospel
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.840]   may have been all right a hundred years ago and a thousand years ago and two
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   thousand years ago nearly, it's obviously monstrous and ridiculous to present it
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   the same gospel to the modern men because of these changes that have taken
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   place and because of this entirely new position in which he finds himself. Now
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   I'm saying that there is nothing which is really quite so foolish and so
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.640]   ridiculous as just that attitude, and I can prove that to you very simply. If
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.320]   we'd got nothing but this first epistle to the Corinthians and even these first
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.280]   chapters, we would be able to give the lie direct to this idea that modern men
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.640]   has about himself. He will persist in thinking that there's something ultra
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.920]   modern in rejecting this gospel. Well now the answer of course is simply this, that
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.080]   there is nothing new about this at all. The gospel of Jesus Christ was rejected
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.280]   in the first century at the very beginning. Our Lord himself was not only
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   rejected, he was vilified, he was crucified, and these apostles as they
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.040]   went around preaching, they were given the same treatment, they met better
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   opposition. The Apostle Paul himself had to meet it constantly. He was referred to
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.640]   in the great intellectual city of Athens, the Mecca of the philosophers, as this
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:15.160]   babbler. And here he reminds us that this gospel was something that was being
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.920]   rejected in his own day and generation. There's nothing new about the fact then
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.960]   of the rejection of the gospel. But I want to go further. Mankind is not only
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.280]   not doing anything new in rejecting the gospel, we see further that his reasons
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   for rejecting the gospel are not new either. He simply goes on repeating the
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.880]   same things as have been said by men throughout the running centuries, and
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.640]   was said even here a way back right at the very beginning. Now there are many
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.760]   reasons which men give for their rejection of the Christian gospel, but
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.120]   one of the commonest, and today especially, I suppose it is the commonest
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:10.320]   of all. It is rejected, I say, in terms of human wisdom, human knowledge, human
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.600]   understanding. And yet here in this very section with which we are dealing, the
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.360]   Apostle shows that that was the very essence of the rejection of the gospel
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.560]   by the Greeks in the first century, in Paul's own day and generation. That was
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.040]   the reason why they, the Greeks speaking generally, the philosophers particularly,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.200]   rejected this gospel, regarded it as foolishness, and condemned it utterly and
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   outright. Now you see therefore there is nothing new about this at all. Indeed
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.400]   this was so much the case in Corinth that the Apostle diverts the first
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.720]   chapters, first four chapters of this great epistle to deal with this
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.080]   very theme. And here it is dealt with once and forever, and yet the astounding
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   thing is that people go on uttering these cliches, making these foolish
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.340]   claims, giving these ridiculous reasons for their rejection of the gospel as if
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.800]   they were doing something which is absolutely new. It isn't. The Greeks on
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   the whole rejected the gospel for this one reason, that it seemed to their
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.720]   natural human wisdom, which we call philosophy, it appeared to be utterly
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.480]   ridiculous foolishness, folly, something that was really quite unworthy of their
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:46.200]   consideration. Now this is obviously therefore a very serious matter. Now we
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.480]   are concerned here not about details. The difficulty about the Greek rejection of
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.520]   the gospel was not that it dissented from particular details or points, it was
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   entirely opposed to it. The whole thing was to them sheer folly. And it is because
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   this is still true, that I'm calling your attention to this whole matter. The
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.480]   difficulty today that people have with the gospel, as it is in the New Testament,
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.840]   that they rejected in total the whole thing. There are some who are even foolish
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.960]   enough to be trying to construct what they call a new gospel, a gospel that
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.600]   suits modern men in this atomic age, and here they are trying to construct a
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.280]   gospel that will be acceptable to the modern men, of whom they're so fond of
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.760]   telling us that he no longer believes in a three-dimensional world and so on, and
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.920]   cannot possibly believe in the supernatural and the miraculous and
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   things of that kind. Now that, according to the Apostle, is not only a complete
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.480]   travesty of the gospel, it is a betrayal of the gospel. He wrote these four
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.120]   chapters specifically to deal with that very point. That was the thing that was
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   happening in Corinth. There were these other teachers who were coming in and
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.640]   trying to introduce a mixture of philosophy, and Paul says you mustn't do
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.880]   this. And that is why, as we saw last Sunday night, he says, "Other foundation
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.320]   can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ." And he goes on to
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.160]   say, "Not only that, be very careful what you erect on this foundation. It must be
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.280]   consistent with, and in accordance with, the character of the foundation." He says,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.920]   "You add certain things, you destroy the whole." As he put it there in the 17th
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.480]   verse of the first chapter, "If you add this human wisdom, you make the cross of
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.560]   Christ of none effect." And yet, my dear friends, isn't that the very thing that
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.720]   is happening at the present time? Isn't this the tragedy that so often, this very
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   thing that Paul condemns, is the thing that is being presented and advocated as
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.520]   the gospel, the Christianity for the modern man? It is a complete denial of
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.240]   the essence of Paul's teaching in these great chapters. Now then, this is so vital
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:13.600]   that I'm calling your attention to it. What can be more important? If our whole
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.920]   approach to the gospel is wrong, well then, we become wrong eventually at every
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.680]   point. You can't select certain things. This is a whole, as Paul says, there is
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.160]   this intimate connection between foundation and superstructure. It is all
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.120]   one piece. It must all fit together. It's all going to be tried. If you begin to
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.680]   try to build on this foundation wood or hay or stubble, when the trial comes, and
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.880]   it's a trial by far, there'll be nothing left of your wood and hay and stubble.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.000]   There is only one kind of material that is appropriate to such a foundation, and
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.680]   that is gold, silver, precious stone, something that can test, can stand the
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:02.880]   test of fire and purification and come through. So you see, this is a really
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.400]   vital matter. Let me therefore put it to your consideration this evening in the
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:14.800]   form of some three principles. Here's the first. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:24.440]   complete contrast to everything else that man thinks and has been taught. Now
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.520]   there it is. I put it as a principle. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a complete
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.760]   contrast to everything we think by nature, everything that human wisdom and
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:43.400]   knowledge can bring to us. Now I'm emphasizing this. The gospel does not
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.120]   merely differ slightly in certain details. It's altogether different, and
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.880]   the altogether aspect is much more important than the details. You see, this
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.520]   is where so many have gone wrong. Books used to be written about this a great
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.760]   deal during the end of the last century. People used to point out how much of the
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.800]   teaching of the Sermon on the Mount could be found in Seneca and so on and
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.240]   in various other Greek philosophers. And of course that's perfectly true. What's
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.800]   the difference then? Ah, you see, the mistake there is to take certain details
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.400]   of the teaching and say, "Ah, well, you get parallels, you get things similar in
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.880]   Greek philosophy and teaching." Therefore, after all, the gospel isn't very much
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.720]   different. That was their whole attempt. They were trying to reconstruct Jesus,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.080]   the human Jesus, the Jesus of history, and to reduce the teaching of the gospel to
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.360]   the level of a glorified morality teaching and humanism. Ah, but you see
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:49.400]   where they were wrong. The vital point is not the details. It is the whole thing.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:55.680]   And here I am emphasizing that the gospel isn't merely different slightly
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.480]   here and there and in particular respects from other teachings. It is
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:07.080]   altogether different. It is entirely different. It is unique. Let me put that
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.920]   in a second way. The gospel, therefore, is not one of a series of teachings. We can't
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.800]   say this too often because the opposite is being said too often. Plato, Socrates,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:28.080]   Aristotle, Jesus, and so on. Now, the gospel is not one of a series. It is unique. It is
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.040]   entirely on its own. This is the whole point that is made by the Apostle. He
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.340]   contrasts the wisdom of God and the wisdom of this world, and he says that
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.640]   they're entirely different. Now, in what respects are they different? Well, I want
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.600]   to show you this first of all in general before we come to the particulars. These
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   are the very contrasts which are made by the Apostle. All other teachings
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:02.520]   confronting the human race tonight, at their best and at their highest, are all
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:10.120]   of men. It's no part of the preaching of the gospel in a sense to disparage the
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.480]   efforts of men only when they claim to be adequate and claim to be gospel. But
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.960]   the point about them all is even at their best and their highest that they're
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:26.580]   entirely and altogether of man. Take the most exalted teachings. It is a man or
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.680]   a group of men that have produced them and propounded them and propagated them.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:39.960]   Always of men. But here we have something entirely different. This is altogether
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.560]   of God. That is why I say you must never put it into series with anything else.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.960]   It's different. That's why the Christian faith is different from the so-called
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.680]   world religions. It doesn't belong to them. They've all been conjured up and
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.000]   produced by men. Great men, great thinkers, all right, but they're men. It's men
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.920]   trying to find God. Here it's the exact opposite. It is God seeking men in his
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.440]   lost and terrible condition. Or to put that in a slightly different form, all
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:21.200]   other teachings are the results of men's ability, men's reason, men's thinking,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:28.040]   men's searching, men's research, if you like. This is the great word of today,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   research, investigation, endeavor, searching, delving into the mystery, using your
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.240]   abilities and your powers. And we know that all knowledge that belongs to men
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.760]   has been discovered in that way. There was a time when men used to just sit
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.440]   down. That was the philosophical method. You sat down and you thought about life
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.400]   and you evolved your theories. And then you tried them by
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   experiments and by practice. Well now, that still goes on, but less and less has
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.760]   it been a matter of abstract thought, and more and more has it been a question of
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.840]   experimentation. And this is the great age of research. And we are proud of our
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.400]   knowledge, the knowledge we've garnered and the information we have, and the
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   advances that have been made. Now it doesn't matter what realm you're
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.320]   thinking of at all. Human knowledge and human wisdom all comes as the result of
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:35.040]   men's seeking and searching and endeavor. This is entirely and absolutely and
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:42.760]   altogether different. How? Well in this way, that this is entirely a matter of
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:49.840]   revelation. Now this is basic as you can see, and quite fundamental. That is why I
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.680]   say it is altogether different from everything that is known to men. This is
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.040]   God making things known. Not men arriving at the knowledge, but God making the
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.800]   knowledge plain and clear and manifest. Now it's not surprising that this
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.160]   Apostle Paul of all men should be emphasizing this particular point.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:17.200]   Because here was an unusually able and brilliant man. One of the great minds, one
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.160]   of the great brains of the ages. Brilliant scholar. Not only in his own
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.200]   particular realm, he was outstanding as a Pharisee. Unusually well trained,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   particularly erudite. But he had his knowledge of Greek philosophy also. He
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.240]   was a Roman citizen by birth. He was a very cultured man. And you remember how
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.600]   he tells us in his autobiography in Philippians 3, that he had trusted to
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   this, and he had done well in it, and he had excelled at it, and he was
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:53.600]   tremendously proud of himself. And then suddenly it was all shattered. Shattered
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.640]   by what? Shattered by what he saw. Shattered by what he was given to see. He
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.480]   was on his way to Damascus, you remember. Breathing out threatenings and slaughter,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   intent upon the destruction of the Christian Church. He did it in all good
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.920]   conscience, he says. He thought he was rendering God service. It was in accord
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.560]   with all his learning, and his law, and his studying, and all his brilliant
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:24.280]   understanding and logic. But suddenly something happens to him. A light shines
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.160]   in the heavens. The face appears. The mind speaks. And he's completely shattered.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:37.120]   He's changed right about. And he now becomes a preacher and an apostle of the
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.440]   Christian message. How did he ever come to that? Was it as the result of his
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.160]   thinking, and his reading, and his meditation, and his listening to lectures
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.320]   and discussions? Of course it wasn't. It was the opposite of that. It was God
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.680]   revealing it unto him. And that's the great point which he makes in these four
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.440]   great chapters. God, he says in chapter 2, has revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   For the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. This is revelation.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.160]   And it's the eternal opposite of everything that human wisdom depends
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:20.480]   upon. It's altogether different, you see, even in its method. And another way in
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.240]   which I can show you one of these general differences is this. Take human
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.440]   knowledge in any realm. Philosophy, science, any other study you like. Its
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:38.400]   great characteristic is that it changes, that it grows, that it develops with the
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.240]   passage of time. Needn't waste your time with this. I've often pointed it out to
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.440]   you. Take a textbook on medicine. They're always having to bring out new
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.680]   additions, and there are great changes. A textbook of 40 years ago, the kind of
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.840]   textbook I had to read, right out of date. It's no use reading that now. Knowledge
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.280]   advances, knowledge grows and develops, and it's the same in all these other
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:11.160]   realms. Constant change, development, and so on. That's the characteristic of all
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.200]   human wisdom, in a sense, isn't it? I know we can make too much even of that point.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.640]   I wonder how much further we've got as regards pure thought and
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.360]   understanding beyond the Greek philosophers. But we think we have. We
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   certainly know facts and certain details of knowledge of which they were ignorant.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.320]   This is the characteristic of man's wisdom, which he arrives at as the result
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.200]   of his own efforts and research. But when you come to this, my friend, it's
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.360]   altogether different. The great characteristic of this is that it's
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:53.240]   changeless, that it is eternal. It is called the everlasting gospel. Jude talks
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:59.840]   about the faith once and forever delivered to the saints. Now this, you see,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   is an absolute point. All of the knowledge in all of the realms, I say go
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.640]   in for the latest, get the latest textbook. Generally the latest is the
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:14.240]   best. But when you come here, there is no change, there is no development, there is
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:20.160]   no difference. It is the changeless, everlasting gospel. We are face to face
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:29.920]   with truth, unchanged, unchanging. I'll go further. This cannot even be modified. And
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.000]   that was, as I say, the particular point that the Apostle was making with respect
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   to the Church at Corinth. They were saying, "All right, we agree about the
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.040]   foundation, but you don't stop there." They were adding to it, trying to introduce a
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.240]   bit of philosophy. "Don't," says Paul, "don't, you're modifying it. You can't modify this
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:52.000]   gospel." Because it is of God, it is eternal, it is changeless. It doesn't change with
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.440]   the passing of the centuries. So that there is no greater denial of this
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:03.320]   gospel, than to say that because we are in the 20th century that we need a new
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   gospel. That's to go back to man and to philosophy, to human wisdom. It is the
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:17.800]   exact opposite of this. This is God's and it's once and forever. And lastly, on this
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.560]   general point, the great characteristic, of course, of human wisdom and of human
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.400]   learning is that it gives glory to men. So Paul ends off by saying here, "Therefore
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.480]   let no man glory in men." You see what they were doing at Corinth, behaving like
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:43.200]   children, he says. One says, "I'm a fool." Says, "No," says the other, "Apollos is better." "No, no, no, wait a minute," says the other, "Cephas is the man, you know." And here they were,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.760]   dividing up Christ and the church into factions, into rival groups, in terms of
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   men. I said at the beginning that the world doesn't change. And it doesn't. The
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.800]   modern world is doing exactly the same thing. I was thinking to myself as I was
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.960]   preparing this meditation, of the fashions that I have seen coming and
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:12.360]   going in the realm of religion during my lifetime, during my period in the
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.000]   ministry. You know, there were certain names 40 years ago, you never hear the
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.400]   mention of. The modern man probably has never heard of them at all. Certain names,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.320]   this is it, this is the man. And everybody runs after him, they all buy his books.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.500]   Quite forgotten by now, another one comes up, "Ah, this is the man." And so they do it,
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.200]   you see, these fashions come and go. Carlebart came along, it was all Carlebart, but he's on
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.760]   the way now. Thus they come, Brunner, largely forgotten, Nibur, forgotten, Tillich,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.080]   and so on. You see, these names, Paul, Apollo, Cephas, and so they claim to men,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.640]   and they glory in men. This is a marvelous teaching, this, and they run after this
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.720]   teaching and that. They're still doing it exactly as they did in the first century.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.680]   You see, it's human teachers that matter. So we're always waiting for a new book,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.520]   waiting for a new insight, waiting for some genius to appear who will speak the
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   magical word. And he comes and he goes, and another comes and we wait, and on and
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:18.000]   on we go. Oh, the difference when you come to this. There's no glory for men here.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.800]   The glory is entirely God. Do you notice how Paul ended that first chapter of his?
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.400]   "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.160]   righteousness and sanctification and redemption, that according as it is
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:45.020]   written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." The glory, the credit, the
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:52.760]   honor is here entirely God's and not men's at all. Now there you see some of the
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:59.560]   ways in which we see that the gospel is altogether and entirely different in its
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.600]   whole approach, in its very essence of genius from all the teachings of men. So
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.880]   I go to my second principle which is this one. Because all that is true, the
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:22.680]   gospel is consequently something that is beyond men's understanding. Now I'm
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:28.200]   dealing here with the very essence of the modern position. Men doesn't realize
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.080]   that it's different. Then you see here is the second point and this is a very
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.040]   vital one, but I lay it down as a proposition. Because the gospel is what
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:43.680]   it is, it follows a necessity that it is something beyond men's understanding
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.960]   entirely. Now then, here is a very crucial point. This is the reason why so many
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:56.040]   reject it. This is the great stumbling block. Man by nature is a philosopher.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.880]   It's a part of his pride. He wants to understand everything. He says I'm not
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.040]   gonna believe a thing if I don't understand it. Incidentally he believes a
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.240]   great deal without understanding it. I've often used the illustration of
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   electricity. We still don't know what it is but we use it don't we? But man says
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.880]   no I'm not gonna believe, I'm not gonna allow it to do anything to me unless I
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.440]   can understand it. And this is the great stumbling block. Men can't understand
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.720]   this. Because he can't understand it he rejects it. But it's a very vital point
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.280]   because it determines I say our whole approach to the gospel. We come with our
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.040]   natural understandings and we want to know, we want explanations, we want to
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:44.280]   understand them. And here it is absolutely fatal. Now let me demonstrate this. Why is
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.080]   it that men cannot understand this gospel? Well the first answer I've
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:28:00.640]   already been giving to you. Because it is the result of God's mind, God's thinking,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:08.360]   God's own understanding. That alone is a sufficient answer. This is the mind of
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:16.880]   the eternal, the everlasting God. And his way is a supernatural. It is a miraculous
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   way. Now let's be clear about this. The gospel of Jesus Christ is frankly
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:30.760]   miraculous and supernatural. If it were not it wouldn't save anybody. It is
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.680]   because it is supernatural and miraculous that it holds out any hope for
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.120]   us at all. Man as I showed you last Sunday night has completely failed. He
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.400]   cannot lay a foundation. God can. And God does it because he's God and it's
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.640]   supernatural. It is miraculous. And therefore by definition it is something
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.960]   that eludes our understanding. Men cannot understand the miraculous and the
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.680]   supernatural. That is why he doesn't believe in it because he can't
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.840]   understand it. But that's the height of his folly. Because he can't even
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.560]   understand the natural. Look at the mysteries in science. Look at the
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.000]   mysteries even in what we have discovered. Well then when you go into
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.480]   the realm of God himself acting directly, the whole thing becomes a sheer
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.240]   impossibility. So one reason why this gospel is altogether beyond human
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.680]   understanding is because of its supernatural character. Because of the
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:32.520]   miraculous element. And it's full of that. It's full of angels. It speaks of
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.960]   things like the virgin birth. It speaks of the working of miracles. It speaks of
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.040]   the men rising from the dead. These are the very terms of this gospel. And all
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:52.000]   along you see they are miraculous and they are supernatural. This is God's
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.740]   thinking. But then put to that the state and the condition of men's mind. This
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.840]   mind of which we are all so proud. And there's no need for me to detract from
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.040]   that or to derogate from it. But look at it as it is. And the great characteristics
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.960]   you find are these. Men's mind at its best is very finite. It's very limited.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   How difficult it is to learn. Look at all the books. You can't read them. You
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.960]   haven't got the time. You can't understand them. Men's mind is finite.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.120]   It's always coming up against limits and realms beyond which it can't go.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.160]   Question marks, queries. Indeed everything as I say today has become fluid and
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:40.360]   uncertain. But men's mind is not only finite. That's enough you know. How can a
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:48.840]   finite mind comprehend the infinite? Can a man encompass the mind of God or read
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.720]   your Bibles and you'll see men who've tried in various ways to do that
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.480]   admitting their utter inability, their utter defeat. But not only is men's mind
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:03.880]   finite, men's mind is sinful. And here is a much more serious thing. Our minds are
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:11.280]   biased. Biased against God. Darkened. According to this teaching our minds are
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.180]   not functioning as they should do and as they're meant to do and as they did in
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:20.720]   the original creation. Men's mind has fallen. His mind has become twisted. It's
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.280]   become perverted. We are full of prejudices. Now when we're honest of
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.880]   course we know that and we admit that. Look at the political prejudices. People
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.720]   try to say that they vote at elections in terms of principles. I wonder. I've
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.840]   seen so many men you know voting one way when they were young and poor, voting the
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.680]   exact opposite way when they get older and have made a bit of money. No no we
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   are creatures of prejudices and we've got our prejudices, racial prejudices, all
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.080]   these prejudices. Why they're causing the chaos and the confusion in the world at
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.040]   the present time. You see men's mind is not only finite it's a diseased mind.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:01.400]   It's a twisted, it's a perverted mind. So not only is it because of its smallness
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:07.760]   incapable of comprehending God and his ways or because it's dark and because
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.080]   it's ugly and because it's twisted and not straight. It cannot possibly do so.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.760]   And thus the mind of the eternal is altogether different as Isaiah puts it.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.360]   My ways are not your ways neither are your thoughts my thoughts says the Lord.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.600]   As the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways and your ways and your
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.840]   thoughts and my thoughts. Sinful, dark, and finite, incapable. That's another reason
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.000]   why we can't even try to understand it if we really have got sense. But you know
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.920]   there is another element here and that's why I read that portion from the first
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:50.120]   chapter. The Apostle teaches there that this is a part of men's punishment for
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   his sin. Men's ultimate sin is pride of intellect, pride of understanding. This is
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.720]   the thing with which he defies God. So a part of his punishment is to be humbled
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.120]   in that respect and the gospel humbles him. The wisdom of this world is
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:11.800]   foolishness with God. God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world. It is a
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.240]   part of men's very punishment. He can do what he likes. He can kick as he likes
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   against it. It won't avail him anything. No, no, this is a part I say of men's
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:31.680]   punishment. He's made foolish. But lastly, this gospel is incomprehensible to men
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:38.240]   and is natural wisdom and ability for this good reason. And this is something
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:45.840]   in which we all ought to glory. It is incomprehensible to men. It is not the
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.920]   result of men's understanding because if it were, salvation would be the
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.760]   prerogative of only a few exceptional people. Do you see what I mean by that? If
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:04.840]   this gospel were something that men can understand, something that is patent to
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.360]   human understanding and comprehension, well then you see the result would
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   inevitably be this. Those amongst us who happen to have been born with good
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:21.040]   brains, real ability, understanding, able to read, able to think, able to argue, able
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.920]   to be logical, able to follow the great demonstrations, why they would have a
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.200]   tremendous advantage over the others, wouldn't they? And of course they're
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.520]   always in a minority. The vast majority of us have not got good brains, not much
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.560]   understanding, and we can't read these great books on philosophy and so on. Now
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.800]   if the gospel were something that men can understand and that a man is saved
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.760]   as the result of his understanding, it would be the prerogative of just a few.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.360]   It would only hold out a hope for a mere handful of VIPs as they're called today.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:01.640]   But thank God it isn't that. If you are to have a gospel that can save anybody, it
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.600]   must not be dependent upon men's ability, but upon the power of God, and that is
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.160]   the truth about this gospel. Because nobody can understand it, the most
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.080]   ignorant and illiterate amongst us and the one most lacking in brain power and
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.720]   intellectuality stands as good a chance as anybody else. And that is where the
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.000]   clever gentlemen of the television don't begin to understand. Can you follow them?
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.160]   Can you understand what they're trying to say? Of course you can't. Thank God you
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.920]   can't, and it doesn't make any difference because they don't either in an ultimate
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.720]   sense. No, no, I say thank God for a gospel which does not depend upon my
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:47.220]   understanding, but is the power of God unto salvation, the revelation that the
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.800]   Spirit of God can make to all and sundry to any man. I have a gospel that gives
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.640]   the hope to the most illiterate sinner in London tonight. Thank God for it. No, no,
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:04.240]   it's altogether different, and it is entirely beyond human understanding. That
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.360]   brings me to my last big principle, which is this one. I want to show you now how
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:15.560]   in actual practice, with regard to the problems confronting us, this gospel does
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:23.680]   differ in every way from all men's ideas. Or if you like, I'm going to show you how
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:32.040]   God in his way of salvation has made man's wisdom look utterly ridiculous and
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:38.320]   foolish. This is what we are told, the wisdom of this world is foolishness with
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:45.080]   God. God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world by the gospel. How does he do
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   so? Well, you can see that by looking at the extraordinary contrast between the
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:58.240]   two things. And I say again that it is a complete contrast. I repeat that because
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.840]   if you don't grasp that, it's no use going on to consider details. Somewhere
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.380]   or another, if you don't grasp these fundamental principles, you'll be getting
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.960]   up at a certain point and saying, "No, I don't quite understand that. I want..." I say
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   you mustn't. The foundation and the superstructure are all one. You mustn't
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.480]   bring in your philosophy at any point. The moment you do, you make it all of no
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   value. It is all together and entirely different. Let me show it to you. Now look for a
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   moment at man's wisdom, by which we mean this. Man confronting the problem of the
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.960]   human race tonight, and man confronting his own personal problem. Now this is
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.400]   what we all should be doing. All honor to the men who are trying to do this. But I
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.280]   want to show you the utter folly of trusting to men's wisdom with regard to
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.720]   this great problem. Why is our world as it is? Why is there so much unhappiness
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:02.600]   in life? Why is there personal failure? You know what the question is. Now look at men's
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   wisdom facing this situation. These are the characteristics of men's wisdom. It
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:17.640]   always starts with men. Always. Always starts with men. Starts with men and the
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:24.000]   human scene, and begins its investigations from that point. I think
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.160]   you'll all agree with it. That's always its starting point. Sociology, humanism,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.480]   these are the terms they give themselves away. They show that they think men alone
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.800]   matters. Men is the center of the universe. Everything revolves around men.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.040]   So you start with men and you end with men. That is the great characteristic
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   always of human wisdom. It must be a necessity. If you know nothing beyond
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.040]   that, well you're bound to start with it, and it always does. The second thing that
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:00.800]   characterizes it is, that it always thinks that this problem is mainly an
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.720]   intellectual problem. Now I could give you many examples and illustrations of
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.960]   what I'm saying. Are they not celebrating this year the centenary of the birth of
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:18.640]   the late Mr. H.G. Wells? Now there is a typical representative of this worldly
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.120]   wisdom, this human wisdom. A man who ridiculed Christianity for the reasons
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:30.000]   I've been giving. Here he is, typical. And his books are very popular, kind of modern
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.560]   prophet, modern philosopher. And that was the essence of his teaching always, that
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:45.360]   the problems of mankind are intellectual. Primarily, essentially, intellectual
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.120]   problems. He always said this. He said that what men needed therefore was
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.040]   education and so on. And that is why you remember the last book that he wrote, in
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.160]   a spirit of great dejection, during the last war, bore this most significant
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:07.480]   title, "Mind at the End of its Tether." He couldn't understand why we'd had another
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.400]   world war. Why? Why didn't men learn? The problem's an intellectual problem of
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.600]   education. So he used to be editor, you remember, of certain encyclopedias of
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   science and of this and that, giving men knowledge and information. It was purely
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.240]   an intellectual problem. That is the essence of human wisdom. It was with the
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.160]   Greek philosophers, they sat down and thought about the problems, they drew up
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.200]   their utopias, they said, "Now, man needs to be instructed." This is what he... it's an
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   intellectual problem. But then come to a practical matter. What is the view taken
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.760]   by worldly human wisdom of man himself? This is the crux of the problem. What is
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:52.040]   its view of men? What is its view of the nature of men? Well, you're familiar with
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:59.880]   this. I needn't keep you. It is that men is essentially an animal. They say a
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.760]   reasoning animal. His cerebrum has developed a little bit more than that in
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:11.120]   the case of animals, but he's an animal with this developed cerebrum, so he's a
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.240]   reasoning animal. And he is developed. Now, but this is the crucial thing. You say,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:26.400]   "Well, now, why does men behave as he does? Is he bad? Is he evil? Is he wrong?" And the
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.080]   reply is, "Of course he's not." They say men is essentially good. You mustn't say men is
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:37.720]   bad. They say the Bible talks about sin, and it's an insult to human nature. It's
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.520]   the thing that's been the greatest drag upon the forward march and development of
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.200]   the human race. Mankind has been kept down by this notion, this doctrine of
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.160]   sin, that man is evil, that he's wrong, that you can't trust him. It's not true.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:57.400]   Man is essentially good. He's noble. There are excellences within him. He wants the
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.080]   best. The trouble is his environment. He doesn't get a chance. Men, they say, is
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:06.200]   essentially good. They reject and resent this doctrine of sin that you have in
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.080]   the Bible and in the message of Christianity, because their view of human
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.280]   nature is that it is essentially good. Well, then you ask, "What is man's need?"
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:24.000]   Well, they say this is quite clear. What man needs is a little bit of help. He's
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.880]   got that within him which is improving. He wants to get better. He's trying to
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.320]   get better. What man really needs, we are told, is to be improved. All he wants is
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.840]   more knowledge, more instruction, better examples. You see, they've sometimes put
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.280]   it like this, that what man needs is to get his mind and to rub that
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.960]   mind against the mind of these great thinkers and philosophers. If then man
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.680]   will improve, he'll begin to think properly. But man's fundamental need, we
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   are told, is to be improved, to be educated, to be made better. Indeed, there
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.240]   is a process that's already doing it, but this needs to be helped. So we multiply
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   our education and our cultural institutions, and thus we are going to
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:15.800]   improve man by a gradual process. And that lastly leads to this, you see, that
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:23.320]   confidence is being placed in man's ability to save himself. It is basic to
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.840]   man's wisdom with regard to the problems of men and the great problem of salvation.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.600]   Man has got it in him to save himself, his society, and his world. He's got the
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.200]   mind, and it needs training and instruction, but he's got the willpower.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.280]   Tell him what to do, and he'll rise up and do it. So you exhort him and you
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:50.160]   instruct him. You see, the essence of the position is this, in a sense, that man is
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.320]   regarded as a good being, full of love, but he hasn't got a chance. His
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.560]   environment is against him. You remember the emphasis that used to be placed
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.720]   upon poverty and slums as if they were the sole cause of sin, not realizing that
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.000]   those who lived in palaces and had more money than they could handle were guilty
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.920]   of exactly the same things, and by today, of course, we are being
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.880]   told that most of our problems are due to our affluence. Once upon a time it was
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.400]   men sinned because they were poor. Now we are told they sinned because they've got
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.440]   too much money. You see, it's all a matter of environment, and therefore you must
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   improve the environment. We're always being told this, and man is ready to
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.840]   respond. Give him a chance, and he'll save himself. This is the essence of man's
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:43.280]   wisdom. Humanism called it what he will. It believes that man has it in himself
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   by his own effort and moral striving and diligence and application to redeem
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:54.600]   himself, his own life, and that of society. There are the characteristics of human
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:04.560]   wisdom. What of God's wisdom? Can't you see that it's the exact opposite? Can't
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:10.320]   you see that it makes men's wisdom look utterly ridiculous and foolish? But my
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.080]   dear friends, even before I mention what this has got to say, doesn't contemporary
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.840]   history make men's wisdom look foolish? Why is the world as it is? If all that
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.960]   we've been told is true, why, it's not surprising that poor H.G. Wells died in
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   dejection and with a feeling of hopelessness. He was almost in despair.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.480]   What could he do? He wasn't the only one. There was another man who wrote his
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.520]   autobiography, the head of a college in Oxford during the last war. The
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.120]   Jerseyman's Journal, I think he called it, Merritt, Professor Merritt of Oxford. He
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.840]   said exactly the same thing. He couldn't understand the last war. Professor
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.360]   Gilbert Murray, another great classical humanist, he said exactly the same thing.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.080]   These men were really shaken and shattered by the Second World War. These
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.200]   were the men like Professor Gilbert Murray, who were the greatest advocate of the League
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.480]   of Nations, and he believed that by going around and holding meetings and telling
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.760]   people they'd banish war, all a matter of intellectuality and application, and they
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:19.600]   couldn't understand. The wisdom of this world is made foolish, even by
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.800]   contemporary history. But when you look at the Gospel, you see the folly of men's
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.600]   wisdom still more plainly and clearly. Look at the contrast. That starts with
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.960]   men. Where does this start? Well, as I've told you, it is with God. It is all from
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.120]   God. The Christian, as he looks at the modern world, he doesn't start with men.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:45.000]   He starts with God. Why? Well, he says, "Where does the world come from? What is
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.040]   man?" And he says, "You can't understand those questions except in the light of
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.280]   God." The Bible starts with the words in the beginning, "God created." That's the way to
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.040]   begin. If you start with men, you'll always go wrong, because you cannot
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:07.360]   understand men except in the light of God. Secondly, this message says God's
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.840]   wisdom teaches us that the problem of men is not merely an intellectual
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:21.320]   problem. It's not merely a problem of knowledge. It is much deeper. It's at the
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:26.880]   very center of personality. According to the Bible, the trouble with us is not
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.520]   that we are wrong in this respect or in that respect. It is that we are all wrong.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.280]   There is no health in him, says Isaiah, from the crown of his head to the soles
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.320]   of his feet. It is all rottenness. The Apostle Paul looks at himself and says,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:49.360]   "In me, that is to say in my flesh as I am by nature, dwelleth no good thing." My
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.220]   friends, have you ever tested yourself in the light of these two teachings? Which
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.760]   is true of you? Are you a wonderful person? Are you good and kind and generous?
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.640]   Is it just that you've never been given a chance? That your environment is against
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.560]   you? That circumstances haven't given you an opportunity or other people? Is it
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.680]   that? Or do you know that there's that within you which gets you down, that
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:16.200]   rotten, that you're your own greatest enemy? I've often quoted it. I quote it
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:23.940]   again. The false, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves that we
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:28.280]   are underlings. It's the message of this book from beginning to end, that man's
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.800]   problem is a deep one. It's a profound one. It isn't merely intellect and
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   understanding and teaching. It's something at the very center of man's
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:44.520]   being. He's become rotten in the gut. And this is, of course, a part of its view of
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:55.200]   man, that he's a fallen creature, that he's evil, that he's perverted, that he's
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:02.000]   got a mind that is at enmity against God, that he is as he is because he loves
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.040]   darkness. Our Lord used these words. This, he says, is the condemnation, that light
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:17.480]   has come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light because their
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:25.760]   deeds were evil. That's the trouble with men. He loves the darkness. He delights in
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:31.600]   evil. He prefers the wrong to the right. Now, you see, the two views are
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:37.520]   diametrically opposed. Man essentially good, says human wisdom. Man essentially
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.720]   bad, says the other. Which is the better explanation of the state of the world
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.040]   today? Which is more adequate to deal with the present position? Why does man
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.200]   go on as he's going? Why doesn't he learn from history? Why does he repeat the
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.960]   mistakes of the past? There's only one explanation. He loves the darkness. He
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:03.960]   hates the light. That is the condemnation. Or, as the Apostle Paul puts it in
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:10.840]   writing to Titus, he says, "Do you remember? There was once a time when all of us were
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:18.280]   hateful and hating one another." That, according to the Apostle, is the condition
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:23.520]   of mankind by nature as the result of sin. Not nice, good creatures waiting for
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.880]   an opportunity to do good. Oh, no, no. Hateful creatures hating one another. And
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.640]   how true it is. Look at your modern society. How many of these politicians
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.440]   trust one another? I'm not talking now about the different parties. How many of
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:44.520]   them trust one another in the same party? Hateful and hating one another. Selfish,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:50.440]   self-centered. This is God's wisdom with regard to men. It's the exact opposite of
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.120]   the other. The whole basis is different. Indeed, it tells us that we're all guilty
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:05.240]   and under the wrath of God. What is man's need, therefore? Is it instruction? Is it
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.640]   enlightenment? Is it education? Is it to have a good example which he can imitate?
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.400]   Is that going to deal with this problem? Is the problem only in man's mind? No, no.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:20.360]   We've seen it deeper. It's in the very warp and woof of man's evil nature. And
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:25.440]   all the education of philosophy and culture leaves man as he was. Indeed, he
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:32.400]   seems to be getting worse. What's his need? And here is the eternal answer. He
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:39.240]   needs God. He's in trouble because he's estranged from God, because he's lost the
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:45.080]   face of God, because he's no longer under the blessing of God. Man's first need is
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:50.840]   to be reconciled to God. To have his whole outlook different. Not to start
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:56.320]   with himself and end with himself. Start with God and continue with God. God the
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:03.000]   center. God the beginning and the end. To be reconciled unto God. To be forgiven. To
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.920]   be restored to communion and communication with God. What else does he
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:15.280]   need? And he needs it before even that can happen. Can't you see? Man doesn't need
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:23.200]   to be improved. Man's too vile and rotten to be improved. There's no point in
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:29.600]   painting a rotten apple or trying to polish it. No, no. Man cannot be improved.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:36.960]   Man is in such a state and a condition that he must be born again. He needs an
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:44.680]   entirely new start. He needs a new nature. He needs a new heart. You see, these men
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:49.440]   given insight by the Spirit of God have always seen it. You remember poor King
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.560]   David, after he'd committed adultery and then murder on top of it. When he comes
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.360]   to himself as the result of the speech of the Prophet to him, he writes the 51st
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:07.120]   Psalm and he says, "Create within me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.840]   within me." He realizes that the problem with him is not that he's done these
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.280]   things but that he ever wanted to do them. That he's got a nature that desires
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.880]   such things. He says, "I don't need to be improved. I need to be recreated. Create
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.800]   within me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." That's what man
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.880]   needs according to this wisdom. It's no use just teaching us. We've been taught.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.000]   It's no use giving us examples. It's no use exalting us. No, no. We need a new
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.120]   output. This is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and men
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:45.600]   love darkness rather than light. What do we need? We need a new nature that will
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:52.360]   love the light and hate the darkness. We need to be made new men and women and
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.880]   this is the very thing that is offered to us which brings me to the last point
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.640]   which is this, the way of salvation. Here is a message that tells us that man is
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.360]   completely hopeless, that he is completely helpless. He's proving it. He's
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.080]   showing it in the modern world. We all know it in our own personal lives. How
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.280]   many a time have we made resolutions? How many times have we intended to be better?
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.160]   To give up some wrong or evil? Always to fail. We can't do it. We are utter failures.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:31.400]   Every one of us, we've got a running sore in ourselves. Salvation is of God. Not the
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:38.600]   labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands. Could my zeal? No. Respite? No. Could
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:48.240]   my tears forever flow? Oh, for sin could not atone. Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.560]   And blessed be the name of God. That is what is done. I'm not ashamed of the
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:59.080]   gospel of Christ, says Paul to the Romans. Why not? His answer is, it is the power of
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:05.040]   God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first but also to
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.320]   the Greek. He says I'm ready to come and preach the gospel at Rome. I'm as ready
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.720]   to preach to the Emperor as I am to the servants and the slaves. Why? Because he
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   knows that Emperors and slaves are all one. They're all failures. They're all
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.400]   perverted. They're all vile. They're all helpless. They're all hopeless. Nothing
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:30.480]   can improve any of them. Here is a power from God, the almighty power of God that
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.680]   can give us forgiveness and pardon, that can give us a new nature, the God who
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.240]   created the cosmos at the beginning can recreate our souls and spirits and make
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:47.320]   new men and women of us and give us new and clean hearts. That's the message. You
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.480]   see, it's the opposite of everything men has ever thought. It's ridiculing men's
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:59.440]   wisdom. But you know, the supreme way in which this gospel shows the folly of
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:06.160]   men's wisdom is this, that men should ever reject such a gospel. That's the
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:13.640]   thing that exposes men's folly, that he doesn't recognize this. He doesn't
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.000]   recognize the Son of God when he stands before him. He can look at the cross and
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.240]   curse. He doesn't stand with Isaac Watson and say, "Love so amazing, so divine,
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:34.160]   demands my soul, my life, my all." He doesn't see. He's blind. His wisdom is
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:42.280]   folly. What is he to do? Well, the apostle tells him, "If any men willeth to be wise
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:48.800]   or seemeth to be wise in this world," what's he got to do? Let him become a fool.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.880]   Let him say, "I know nothing." Let him say, "My knowledge and learning doesn't help me.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.120]   It helps me in science. It helps me in industry. It helps me in politics. But
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.640]   when I come here to the matter of life and living, life and death, and myself and
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:11.120]   my soul and God, I'm nothing, I'm nobody. I'm a great ignoramus. I don't know." Let him
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:17.440]   become a fool. Let him become such that the world will laugh at him and ridicule
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:23.760]   him as it did his Lord before him. Let him, in other words, in his helplessness
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:30.280]   and his emptiness and woe, confess his sin and failure to God and in utter
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:36.920]   simplicity believe this glorious, wonderful message that Jesus of Nazareth
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:45.960]   was the only begotten Son of God, that apparent man is God incarnate, that one
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:51.920]   dying on the cross is the author of life. The miraculous intervention of God,
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.960]   sending his only Son, living a perfect life, working miracles, showing his Godhead,
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:03.080]   conquering even death and the grave, able to give through the Holy Spirit
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.800]   something of his own glorious nature to those who believe in him. If any man
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:15.440]   willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool. Let him believe this
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:24.080]   gospel as a little child in simplicity, and he will begin to partake of the
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:28.920]   wisdom of God and be able to claim with the Apostle in what he says at the end
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:39.680]   of the second chapter, "We have the mind of Christ." Let him become a fool and he
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:47.000]   will be made wise with the wisdom transcending man's at its highest, the
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:54.720]   wisdom of God himself. Have you become a fool? Have you asked him to have pity
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.280]   upon you? Have you asked him to work the miracle upon you, the miracle of the new
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:06.320]   birth, the understanding of the things of God? Amen.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
