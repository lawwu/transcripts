[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.680]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the third chapter, verses 7 and 8.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.080]   Verses 7 and 8 in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360]   "Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.240]   me by the effectual working of his power unto me, who am less than the least of all saints,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.400]   is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   of Christ."
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.800]   Now, you remember that the apostle has been telling these Ephesians that the great and
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.680]   wonderful thing, the mystery which had been revealed unto him in particular is that they
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:00.000]   as Gentiles should come into the Christian church on an absolute equality with the Jews,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   that they should be fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the great
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040]   promise that God had ever held out before his people.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.280]   In other words, they now, with the Jews, are this new nation that God has formed for himself
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.160]   and in whom and upon whom now all the great promises of God center and in whom they are
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.040]   to be fulfilled.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.480]   And he reminds them that it was he who had the great privilege of informing them of all
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.480]   that.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.040]   A very special dispensation of the grace of God had been given unto him in order that
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.240]   he might bring the message to them.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.320]   And he had done so by preaching to them the gospel, the good news, this very thing about
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.520]   which he is now anxious to tell them.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   And so he takes up that particular thing.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.540]   How he had been given this great privilege of preaching the gospel unto them.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.120]   And as he thinks of it, you notice how he is moved and how he is carried away by the
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   greatness and the glory of it all.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.160]   There is nothing more moving, surely, in all this man's writings than this particular
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   statement.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.800]   "Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   me by the effectual working of his power, unto me, who am less than the least of all
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   saints, is this grace given, that in order that I should preach among the Gentiles the
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.660]   unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.660]   Very well.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.100]   We must analyze this and look at it together and see its relevance to us at this present
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.460]   moment.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.460]   What does he say then?
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.860]   Well, let us put it like this.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.740]   His first statement is that he has been made a minister of the gospel.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.660]   A minister is one who serves in the interests and for the benefits of others.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.460]   That is the meaning of this word "minister."
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.700]   And what he is saying is this, that this mystery had been revealed to him by God in order that
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.380]   he might teach the Gentiles, that he might give them this great benefit.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.080]   There they were as aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.180]   of promise without hope and without God in the world in the darkness of paganism.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.580]   And he has been given this dispensation of the grace of God in order that he might bring
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.180]   to them this great benefit.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.260]   So he went and he preached to them.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.260]   He was called to do that and that was the thing that he was enabled to do.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.480]   But the thing that he is anxious that they should realize is this, that all these benefits
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.940]   which they are now enjoying as fellow heirs, etc., with the Jews, have come to them through
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.700]   the gospel, the gospel which he had preached and of which he is a minister.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.380]   Now we haven't got time to do this this morning, but here is a very wonderful picture of the
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.740]   ministry, the Christian minister and to what he is called.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.740]   And I do feel at times that perhaps this is the first thing that the Christian church
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.460]   needs to recapture at this present hour.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.540]   Paul says that he was called to exercise this ministry in the gospel.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.540]   That is his calling.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.820]   That is the thing that Christ laid his hand upon him for.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.860]   And oh how far we have departed from that.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.120]   I wonder whether the Christian church isn't as she is this morning and counts so little
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.740]   in this modern world because of that.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.540]   The whole idea of the ministry has become debased.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.700]   It has been regarded often as a profession.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.180]   The eldest son perhaps goes into the army or the navy and others go in for other things
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.420]   and then there is nothing left, as it were, for the remaining son but the Christian ministry.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.420]   How often has it been looked upon in that way?
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.780]   The minister, what is he?
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.820]   Well, he is a man who is to organize games and pleasant entertainments for young people.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   He is a man who is to visit and have a pleasant cup of tea with people.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.260]   That is the conception of the Christian ministry that has become much too current.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.140]   But my dear friends, it is a travesty.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.860]   A minister is a herald of the glad tidings.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.060]   He is a preacher of the gospel.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.500]   He is a minister of the gospel.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.780]   He is a prophet.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.060]   And it seems to me that very largely because this whole conception of the ministry has
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.340]   become debased that the ministry has lost its authority.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.780]   And as I say, it counts for so little at the present time.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.700]   Pray for the ministers, my friends.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.420]   Pray God that at a time like this, that men and women shall come back and have this old
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.060]   conception, this New Testament conception of the ministry.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.460]   The world needs a Savonarola or two.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.620]   Men and women need to be shaken out of their lethargy, out of their sinfulness, out of
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.260]   their indolence and slackness.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.100]   It is needed in this country.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.980]   And so I say that we are reminded thus hurriedly in passing of the Apostle's great conception
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.740]   of the Christian ministry.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.620]   He is a minister of the gospel.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.460]   We are called primarily to teach men and women concerning this great revelation of God, concerning
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.620]   himself, concerning men, concerning the only way of reconciliation, concerning the kind
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.860]   of life that mankind is meant to live.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.580]   But I pass on to a second thing.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.900]   The Apostle expresses his amazement that this should ever have happened to him.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:31.300]   You notice how he puts it unto me, "Who am less than the least of all saints?
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.500]   Was this grace given?"
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.460]   Now this isn't mock modesty.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.420]   This isn't a kind of affectation.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.660]   This isn't hypocrisy.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.300]   And indeed it is in no sense a contradiction of what he says elsewhere about himself, where
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.500]   he says that he is not behind the very chiefest apostles.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.900]   You remember how he says that in writing to the Corinthians.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.300]   Well how do we reconcile them like this?
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:08.180]   What he never got over was the fact that the blaspheming and injurious Saul of Tarsus had
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.940]   ever been called not only into the Christian life but made an apostle, and given this unique
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.500]   privilege of being in a very special manner the apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.800]   He never forgot it.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.660]   And it's a bad day in the life of any Christian when he forgets his origin, when he forgets
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.780]   the pit out of which he has been drawn.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.460]   It isn't that we should look perpetually backwards and become morbid and perpetually
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.700]   remind ourselves of our sins, but the essence of the Christian position is that we should
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:50.060]   always realize that it is by grace we are saved, that we are what we are solely and
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.740]   entirely by the grace of God.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.940]   And if we don't remember that we'll lose our thanksgiving and our praise.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.500]   We'll assume that all is well.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.620]   Now the apostle never got into that condition.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.780]   He never forgot that.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.380]   There he was, and here he is.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.180]   Oh, this privilege, oh, the grace of God that has brought about this tremendous transfer.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.500]   But I think there was another element in it.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.020]   Here was a man who lived so near to Christ that he was conscious of his deficiencies,
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.620]   conscious of his shortcomings.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.460]   Laboring as he did indefatigably, he was nevertheless conscious of how little he'd done, how much
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.060]   more he might have done.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.340]   He expresses that in many places.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.860]   So this is a true humility.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.780]   This is a typical Christian meekness.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.960]   I don't stay with this either, but let us note it as we pass.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.060]   If a man isn't conscious of the honor and the dignity of being a Christian at all, and
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:00.260]   especially of having the privilege of preaching the gospel, he's in a very false position.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.940]   The more we realize these things, the more I say shall we be amazed with the apostle
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:13.220]   Paul at this astounding grace and goodness and kindness of God.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.340]   But come to a third thing.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.180]   He explains to the Ephesians and to us how all this had come to him, how it had all happened
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.460]   to him.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.100]   And you notice that again his explanation is that it is all of the grace of God.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.860]   Do you notice how he keeps on repeating this word "given"?
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.460]   Whereof, he says in verse 7, "I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:43.260]   of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power, unto me who am less than the
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.500]   least of all saints."
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.540]   Is this grace given?
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.860]   This is the word that introduces the gospel and salvation.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.860]   Given.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.860]   It's all of grace.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.360]   It's all given.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.420]   The apostle didn't feel worthy of anything.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.580]   Everything had been given to him freely in God's love and mercy and compassion.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.020]   And if you and I, I say again, don't realize this, it's because our whole understanding
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.680]   of salvation is defective.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.920]   But he tells us that it was given in a particular manner.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:24.420]   It was given, he tells us, by the effectual working of his power.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.220]   Now unfortunately the Revised Standard Version which so many people are using today is very
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.660]   weak at this point.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.480]   It simply says, "by the working of his power."
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.540]   But the word is much stronger.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.540]   The Authorized Version is right.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.580]   It is the effectual working of his power.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:45.940]   Or if you like it, you might translate it, "the energetic working of his power."
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.180]   The word conveys that idea.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.740]   Now what is he saying?
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.340]   Well what he's saying is this.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:06.780]   What is it that turned that persecuting, blaspheming hater of Christ into one of the foremost preachers
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.540]   and apostles of Christ?
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.580]   Now there's the question.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.260]   What is it that can produce such a change?
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.240]   You see it's one of the fundamental questions confronting us as we ever look at the Gospel.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.780]   What is it that can turn any man from being a hater of God into one who seeks God?
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.060]   What is it that can turn the natural men to whom the things of God are foolishness into
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.940]   a man who delights in them and who enjoys them and who lives for them and whose highest
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.100]   ambition is to know them more and more?
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   What is it?
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.820]   Well according to the Apostle there's only one answer.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.460]   It is the effectual working of the power of God.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.120]   Nothing else.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.240]   And of course he was very conscious of it.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.280]   If he had been left to himself he would still have been the persecuting, blaspheming Pharisee.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.180]   He had heard about the preaching of Christ.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.620]   He may have heard some of the apostles preaching.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.720]   He knew all the claims, but he hated it all.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   He saw nothing in it.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.000]   He regarded it as blasphemy.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.840]   What happened to this man?
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.620]   Well there's only one answer.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.760]   The man was entirely made anew.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.840]   He was regenerated.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.560]   He was made a new man.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.320]   He says himself it's a new creation.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.640]   It's nothing less than that.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.040]   There is no other explanation and this is the result of the effectual working of the
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.560]   power of God.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.480]   No man I say again can ever be a Christian except that God makes him a Christian.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.760]   It is the effectual working of the power of God that makes everybody a Christian.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   That is the rebirth.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.740]   That is regeneration.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.740]   It isn't a decision.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.920]   It isn't something that you and I decide to do.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.080]   It is what is done to us.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.400]   The effectual working of his power.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.960]   He would never have been a Christian at all were it not for this.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.600]   But even having become a Christian he would have been ineffective apart from this.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.000]   It is this working, it is this power of God that not only transforms his whole outlook,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.120]   but it calls him into the ministry.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.500]   It gives him the gifts that are requisite to the ministry, the understanding of the
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.260]   ministry, the power to speak, the power to write, the power to teach.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.920]   It is all of God.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.600]   He works it out in great detail in the next chapter.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.120]   He says that when Christ rose he gave gifts unto men, some apostles, some prophets.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.580]   It's all given by God.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.940]   So ministers are given to the church by God.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.320]   And every gift and help in the church is given by God.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.240]   We are helpless in and of ourselves.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.600]   No man can truly preach the gospel in his own strength and in his own power.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.480]   He can talk perhaps, but it isn't preaching and it will lead to nothing.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.360]   Whenever there is an effectual ministry it's because of this working, this energetic working
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.240]   of the power of God through the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   The whole thing you see that the apostle again elaborates in 1 Corinthians 2, that his preaching
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.200]   was not with enticing words of man's wisdom.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.640]   He doesn't depend upon human organizations and abilities, but in demonstration of the
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.520]   spirit and of power.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   That's it.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.960]   And here again he brings it in.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   He's received all this.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.680]   He's been put into his position by the energetic working of his power.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.360]   My friends, do we know anything about this?
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.480]   Have you felt the hand of God upon you?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:41.040]   Do you know God's working in your own life and in your own soul?
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.960]   Do you know what it is to be dealt with and to be molded and to be fashioned?
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.200]   That's Christianity.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.960]   It's all the result of the energetic working of his power.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.360]   Indeed the apostle sums this up very perfectly in a great phrase in the first chapter of
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.240]   the epistle to the Colossians in verse 29.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.380]   He's been saying that he preaches warning every man, teaching every man, that he may
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.520]   present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto?
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:17.600]   I also labor, he is laboring, striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.360]   Now that's a wonderful picture of it all.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.040]   I am laboring, says Paul.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   I'm working.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.080]   I'm, as it were, agonizing in my labors.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.640]   Yes, but what is this?
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.400]   It's the result of what he's doing to me and working in me.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.540]   I'm working out what he's working in.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.540]   I'm laboring.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:40.900]   Yes, but according to this tremendous working of God which worketh in me mightily.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.500]   And so you get this perfect blending, if you like, of the divine and the human, the power
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:51.860]   of God energizing a man and enabling him to carry on his work in the ministry.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.900]   Well now then, here we are.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:02.500]   The apostle says that he has thus been prepared and equipped and called in every way in order
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:15.060]   that he might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060]   What a phrase.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:22.380]   What a profound, what a sublime statement.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.380]   What a moving statement.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:32.300]   Ah yes, but it's a statement that also comes and tests us and examines us.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   I don't hesitate to assert, therefore, that the test of all preaching is its conformity
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.980]   to this definition and to this standard.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.740]   Here is a man who's being called to be a minister of the gospel.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.860]   What's the business of a minister of the gospel?
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:53.420]   Well here is his answer, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.340]   Now let's note this and let's see, therefore, how he tests a great deal of probably what
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.380]   is happening this morning.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:06.460]   What is the business of the Christian minister, the preacher of the gospel, at any time?
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.220]   I say it is always to do this.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.780]   What is the business of the Christian preacher?
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.140]   Let's observe what it isn't.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:22.260]   It is not simply to preach about current events.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   Shall I test you?
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.500]   Were you a little bit surprised that I went on with this consideration of Ephesians 3
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.060]   this morning?
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.180]   Did you have a feeling within you for a second, "Ah, I thought you'd have interrupted that
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.820]   series in view of what's happening in the world at this moment"?
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.540]   I thought that there would have been some pronouncement on the international situation,
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.060]   did you?
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.340]   Is that the business of the Christian minister?
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.420]   Is it the business of the Christian minister to express his views as to what the government
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.300]   should have done last week or what it shouldn't have done?
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.020]   There are people who are doing that.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.100]   I have no doubt it's being done in thousands of pulpits this day in this and in other lands,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.620]   and there are men expressing opinions on the international situation who, it seems to me,
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.580]   are not in a position to do so.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.380]   I do not claim that I know any more about the international situation than any one of
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.460]   you.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.300]   I haven't all the facts before me, and for me to express an opinion would be an impertinence.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.940]   I have my views like you all have, but I am in no position to stand and address a company
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.220]   like this in a Christian pulpit and say whether I think the government has done the right
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.260]   thing or the wrong thing.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.700]   I haven't all the facts before me.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.060]   And in any case, I say it is not the business of the Christian minister.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.700]   And I have a feeling that it is because the Church has so often done that kind of thing,
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.380]   that not only is the Church as she is, but the world is as she is.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.740]   I think there's very powerful evidence to prove that it was the action of the Church
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.220]   and certain people in the Church in particular in the 1930s that almost directly produced
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.100]   the last war.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.220]   An impression was given to Hitler and others in Germany that this country had gone completely
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.140]   pacifist and wouldn't fight for anything.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.220]   And I think it's a very dangerous thing for men, whatever their position in the Church,
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.620]   however exalted, to express their opinions.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:25.140]   The Christian minister is called to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.020]   Let me make this quite plain.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.540]   It isn't the business of the Christian minister to express his opinions, his criticisms, his
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.320]   agreement or disagreement.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.180]   It is not the business of the Christian Church to preach patriotism either.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.500]   It's often done so.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.100]   The Church has often been nothing but a recruiting sergeant and a recruiting station, and it's
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.060]   a travesty of the Christian ministry.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.620]   The business of the Christian minister is not any one of these things.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.060]   It's this other thing that the Apostle is talking about.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.140]   My friends, the world was in trouble when Paul wrote these things.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.620]   The world has always been in trouble, but the peculiar business and task of the Church
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.740]   is to do what the Apostle tells us here.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.720]   Far too often the Christian Church and the Christian minister has been nothing but some
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.500]   kind of court chaplain, indulging in vague generalities.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.860]   "No, no," I say, "that's not the business of preaching."
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.780]   Neither is it the business of preaching just to preach and to inculcate a general morality
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.340]   or some general ethic.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.900]   There has been a great deal of this during the last hundred years, and the ministry has
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.580]   become less and less prophetic, and Christianity has become more and more diluted.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.940]   The business of Christianity is not to produce the perfect little gentleman.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.260]   No, no, that isn't its business.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.980]   The world can preach morality and ethics and has always done so in some shape or form.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.660]   The philosophers can do that.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.660]   That isn't the business.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.620]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.380]   The Jews were teaching morality.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.460]   The pagan philosophers had been preaching a morality before Paul was ever called into
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460]   the ministry.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.100]   He isn't doing any of those things.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.860]   This is his test.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.700]   Let me go further.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.380]   The business of the preaching of the gospel is not merely to preach religion, I hope,
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.340]   not even religion, not even godliness in general.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.020]   Because you see, Judaism had been doing that.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.040]   Judaism had been preaching the importance of religion, the vital importance of godliness.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040]   Let me go further.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.580]   It is not the primary business of the preacher of the gospel even to tell people to pray
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:41.460]   and to conform to certain standards and to discipline themselves.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.460]   Mohammedanism does that very effectively indeed.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.740]   It preaches a very stern discipline.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.740]   It preaches a very rigid kind of diversion.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.700]   It preaches a worship of God.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.540]   That's not Christianity.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.900]   You can have godliness in a sense without Christianity.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.300]   It's a false godliness, I know, but it is a kind of godliness and you can have religion
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.100]   and you can have all these things.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.900]   That isn't what Paul has been called to preach.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.700]   He'd been doing all that as a Pharisee.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.100]   I go one step further.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:19.220]   It is not the business of Christian preaching even to teach and to preach the teaching of
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.860]   Christ with regard to certain specific matters.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.980]   Now I have no doubt that in thousands of pulpits today there will be only one message and that
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.940]   is the message of pacifism, a particular teaching.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:36.300]   And there are men who seem to reduce the unsearchable riches of Christ to just pacifism.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.500]   They're preaching on it every Sunday, "War is the absolute sin and if we only behaved
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.380]   in a nice way to other people and didn't fight about anything we'd be much happier."
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.700]   That's the whole of Christianity.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.420]   Is that the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:24:00.060]   You see my friends, all these things fall hopelessly short of this great and wondrous
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:06.180]   definition of the gospel which is given us by the apostle in this great word that we
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.420]   are looking at together this morning.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.220]   Think of all these pompous pronouncements upon the international situation.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.660]   Where does the unsearchable riches of Christ come in?
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.500]   And all the ethical, moral appeals and appeals in the name of the country and all these things.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.820]   Where does Christ and his eternal riches come into it all?
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.140]   It's a travesty.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.880]   It's a waste of time.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.300]   It's an abnegation of the duty which devolves upon us.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.780]   Very well then, what does he preach?
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.180]   Well none of those things I say but this.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:53.780]   Primary and essentially, the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:00.500]   You see it's the riches, the unsearchable riches of Christ which obviously means this,
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:06.740]   that the essence of the gospel is what Christ gives to us.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.860]   Not what we do, not what he even asks us to do.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.300]   That comes later.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.140]   But the obvious beginning and essence of the gospel is what he gives us, what we receive
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.140]   from him.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.940]   Paul is thrilling at the very thought of it.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.580]   He says I was given this great privilege of coming to you and I've given you the good
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.260]   news, the marvellous, the thrilling good news of what?
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.380]   Well of the riches of Christ, what Christ has given to you and what he can and what
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.620]   he will give to you.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.220]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.460]   What he gives, it's the gift of God before it's any call to anything at all.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.820]   Well now then what does this mean?
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.340]   Well let me try to analyse it.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.460]   And as I do so I almost feel I'm being ridiculous.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.500]   You can't analyse this and yet I know that there is such a tendency in us all just to
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   repeat these resounding phrases without knowing what they mean that we must analyse them.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:06.420]   And the apostle fortunately himself goes on to analyse them in the remainder of the chapter.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.860]   What are the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:17.740]   Well the first thing we must emphasise is this.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.260]   It is Christ himself.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.020]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.660]   Not first of all the unsearchable riches that he has to give us but the unsearchable riches
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.540]   that is Christ, Christ himself.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.380]   Now this includes of course what we were dealing with last Sunday, the mystery, what he calls
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.580]   the mystery of Christ.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.780]   And the riches are in him because of the mystery of his incarnation and his taking unto himself
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.540]   human nature and becoming truly man.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.700]   Yes but we've dealt with that so we go on.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.580]   The message of Christianity is Christ himself.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.500]   As has often been pointed out, Christianity is Christ.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.100]   Everything is in him and there is nothing apart from him.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:14.380]   God has put everything into his son and everything that you and I ever derive in the Christian
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.540]   life is derived from him directly.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.660]   Without contact with him we have nothing.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.820]   Apart from me he said he can do nothing.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.340]   John puts it in the first chapter of his Gospel in this way.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:33.380]   Of his fullness have all we received and grace upon grace of his fullness we are united to
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.100]   him and we draw from him.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.580]   He is the fountainhead.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.380]   So that we have to pay particular attention to this.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:53.220]   The message of the Gospel is Christ himself before even what Christ gives.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.260]   Then I look at his second word which is the word unsearchable.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.220]   Oh this is the whole of Christianity.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.740]   If we could but see what is in Christ.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.540]   It's unsearchable if you like, untraceable.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.540]   It's again of course like our definition of the mystery.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:21.460]   It's there and it is revealed but thank God that it has been revealed otherwise we'd know
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.060]   nothing at all about it.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.940]   It's unsearchable, it's untraceable.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.940]   What's he mean?
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.940]   He means this.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.300]   No man can ever find those riches in and of himself.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.860]   Many a man has tried to do so.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.180]   Many a man has approached Christianity philosophically, he's tried to understand it from the outside.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.860]   He might as well have given up at the beginning.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.620]   It can never be done.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.060]   They're untraceable, they're unsearchable.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.980]   Man is inadequate to get at them.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.020]   They're so carefully preserved, they're in such a unique position.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:57.060]   Man can never arrive at them by his own unaided understanding.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.340]   But I want to say another thing about them.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.420]   These riches that are in Christ are unsearchable in this respect.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:10.860]   That no man, not even the Christian, can ever fully comprehend them.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.020]   Paul as he went on was more and more amazed at them.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.380]   He thought at last, "I've got it," but he hadn't got it.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.260]   He thought he'd been to every room in this great treasury and then he found another.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.380]   There's always an inner room and an inner and an inner and you know we'll spend eternity
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:33.820]   in just discovering further reaches of the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.340]   Unsearchable.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.980]   Untraceable.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.220]   So I say another thing that it means is this.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.140]   They can never be fully described.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.140]   Even Paul couldn't.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.220]   That's why you see he has to pile his superlative on top of a superlative.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.740]   Language fails him.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.460]   The unsearchable riches, the exceeding riches of his grace, he says.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.820]   He talks about superabundant here and there.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.460]   He's able to do exceeding abundant above all that we can ask or think.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.660]   Those are his terms.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.940]   It just means that they're unsearchable.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   They cannot be described simply because they're so glorious and so endless.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.260]   And that's the next thing that it means.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.740]   The riches of Christ are unsearchable.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.980]   Thank God for this.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.540]   It means that they're inexhaustible.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.420]   It means that they are endless.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.260]   It means that they can never fail.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.620]   It means that though men and women for all the centuries have been drawing from them
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.140]   and taking of them, there is still as much as there was at the beginning.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.740]   And it can never become less.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:43.060]   It's a never-ebbing sea, as one of the writers of the hymns puts it.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.580]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.780]   Beloved people, do we know anything about this?
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.580]   Are we thrilled at the very term?
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.780]   Does it mean something concrete to us?
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.220]   What are these unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.500]   Well, as I say, they can't be described, but they're facts, so let me try to mention
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   some of them.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.660]   Look at it like this, if you like.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.220]   What is there in Christ for any one of us this morning?
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.100]   Well I'm told there are unsearchable riches.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.940]   Well let me look at it in this way.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.940]   I am poor.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:19.940]   I am empty-handed.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.140]   I am a pauper.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.140]   What do I need?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.060]   Well, he's got everything that I need.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   What are the things I need?
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.020]   Let me take up a phrase of Paul out of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.980]   He says, "Who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.540]   There are the riches, the unsearchable riches.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.060]   But look at it from the standpoint of our need.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.740]   What do we need?
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:48.660]   The first thing we need is wisdom, knowledge, understanding.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:54.020]   Here we are in this great mad world, perplexing in its fury.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.460]   The first thing we want to know is this, what is it all about?
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.220]   Why is man as he is?
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   Is there God?
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.500]   Where is God doing something?
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.240]   How can I know God if the world is collapsing round and about me?
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.020]   Is there no place of steadiness and of steadfastness?
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.020]   It's in God.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.380]   How can I know God?
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.740]   That's our fundamental and primary need.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.180]   And that is our need, my friends.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.820]   And that's why I'm not preaching about the international situation.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.940]   I wouldn't help you if I preached about that.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.460]   But this is my way of helping you.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.700]   If you and I know God, well then what we've read in Psalm 112 is true of us.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.860]   He shall not fear our evil tidings.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.900]   His heart is fixed, resting upon his God.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.380]   Now then, how can I arrive at this knowledge and this wisdom?
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.580]   There's only one answer.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.380]   It is in Christ.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.700]   He of God is made unto us wisdom.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.040]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   What else do I need?
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.720]   Well now then, he teaches me about God, but that makes me conscious of my sinfulness.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.820]   And I say, how can I dare to approach such a God?
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.820]   I'm in agony.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   I'm in a crisis.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.540]   Think of a Christian in Budapest this morning.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.620]   Think of a man, any man in Budapest, who sees everything going and he wants to know God
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.020]   and to be right with God.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.620]   He may be dead before tonight.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.620]   What can he do?
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.380]   How can he stand before God?
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.500]   He's a sinner vile.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.980]   Christ is made unto us righteousness.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.300]   Though you've lived a life of sin and of hell until you came into this service, you
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.180]   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.620]   Your sins are forgiven and you will be clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ at
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.660]   this very moment.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.220]   And you can stand in the presence of God.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.020]   Righteousness.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.620]   The unsearchable riches.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.700]   Yes, but it doesn't finish there.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.900]   You say, I want to go on.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.940]   How can I continue with God?
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.860]   Though I know I'm forgiven and given the righteousness of Christ, I know that sin is
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.780]   still within me and I know the devil is still outside.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.060]   How can I stand up in this fight against evil and sin?
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.900]   Oh, the riches of Christ are unsearchable.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.900]   They're endless.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:10.180]   He's made unto us not only wisdom and righteousness, but also sanctification.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:16.100]   If you and I are to die the next minute, we can be sure of this, that in Christ we will
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.500]   stand before God faultless and blameless.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.540]   His sanctification.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.500]   He is our sanctification.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.780]   In addition to working it out within us.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.820]   And indeed, he is redemption.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.620]   Which means this, that he will raise the body and glorify it and change it.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.100]   The redemption is complete and entire.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100]   There'll be nothing lacking.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.100]   Well, there you are.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.860]   Look at it like that.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   In your poverty, in your need.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:49.620]   There you're confronted by the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.660]   He has everything you need.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:56.100]   Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.620]   Who, like me, his praise should sing.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.780]   Or take it like this.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.780]   What do we really need?
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.780]   What's our greatest need?
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.860]   Well, in a sense, our greatest need is life, isn't it?
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.460]   At a time like this, we tend to see, don't we, that men and women are just existing.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.980]   They haven't got life.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.700]   And you see, when their pleasures are shut off, when because of war the cinemas and theatres
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.620]   and public houses and dance halls have to be shut, they've got nothing.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   They haven't got life.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.660]   They're existing and dependent upon things.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.700]   They need life.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.780]   Where can you get life?
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.700]   And it's he again who has said it, "I have come that they might have life and that they
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.420]   might have it more abundantly."
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.600]   Life which means spiritual life.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.060]   Life which means a relationship to God and an enjoyment of his fellowship.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.060]   That's life.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.500]   And he has it in all its fullness.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:56.740]   And he says, "He that cometh unto me shall never hunger and never thirst.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.780]   The water that I give you," says he to the woman of Samaria, "shall be in you a well
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.420]   of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.700]   So let the world take everything from you.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.900]   Though you may be naked and bereft of all things, life will still go on bubbling up
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.020]   eternally within you."
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.900]   But let me say just a word about this.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.540]   The apostle works it out in detail at the end of this great chapter, but I must mention
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.540]   it here.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.780]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.740]   There's the beginning, reconciling us to God.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.180]   But you know this is still more wonderful.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:41.100]   Christ himself, he is the riches.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:47.020]   And you see it is as I know him and possess him that I am a participator in the riches.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.620]   And this is the thing that Paul goes on saying.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.620]   He had a personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's the richest thing in the
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.620]   world.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.620]   We've all heard that saying, haven't we?
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.460]   And it's perfectly true.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:10.460]   That the greatest blessing we have in this world, in and of itself, is to have a husband
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.180]   or a wife or a friend.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.740]   We say that's the most priceless possession.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.340]   And it's true.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.780]   Under God it is the greatest gift of all.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.740]   Ah, but you see in the gospel you are offered this knowledge and this friendship of Christ.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.540]   The apostle puts it like this in writing to the Philippians.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.620]   To me to live, he says, is Christ.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.900]   That is life to me.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.140]   To know Christ, that's his life.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.580]   Then he says his greatest ambition is this, that I might know him.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.220]   Now he doesn't mean to know about him.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.480]   He means to know him so that he can go and talk to him and listen to him.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.860]   That is how Paul lived.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.540]   He was in this state of communion with Christ.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   He knows him.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:00.140]   He's nearer to him and dearer to him and more real to him than anything in the world.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.780]   That's what he has and he wants it more and more.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:09.840]   And then he prays, of course, for others that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.940]   You see, there's the riches of Christ.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.340]   He comes into your heart and he dwells there.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.180]   He says it himself, doesn't he?
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.420]   Behold, he says, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.780]   If any man shall open unto me, I will enter in.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.700]   And I will take up my abode with him and I will sleep with him and he with me.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.940]   Now there is it, you see.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.240]   The whole riches and treasures of God are in Christ and he comes into your life and
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.420]   into your heart and he dwells in us.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.380]   Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.560]   Here is the unsearchable riches.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.460]   But let me elaborate that in one word.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:53.820]   The thing that the apostle goes on to pray for these Ephesians is this, that they being
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.820]   strengthened with all might by the Spirit in the inner men, that Christ may dwell in
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.500]   their hearts by faith.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   What for?
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.520]   Well, that they may know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth and to
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:12.260]   know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.300]   There is nothing more wonderful in the whole world than that.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.660]   Than to be loved by Christ and to feel it and to know it.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.580]   Oh, what are the riches of the Indies and the whole universe in comparison with this?
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.200]   To be loved by the Son of God.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.140]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.180]   And then go on.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.380]   What does he give us when he comes thus to us?
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:40.260]   Well, the first thing he gives is his own Holy Spirit.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.940]   I indeed baptize you with water, says John the Baptist.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.300]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.700]   The baptism of the Holy Ghost, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, resident within us and
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.980]   our knowing that and his power activating us.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   And what does he give us?
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.380]   Well, no, these are the things that are needed by the world this morning, are they not?
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.220]   First he gives us rest.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:13.820]   Come unto me all ye that labour under heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.860]   Have you got it?
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.900]   He's got it there super abundantly.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   What else?
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.900]   Peace.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   Listen to him.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:27.460]   Peace I give unto you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.460]   you.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.340]   Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let they be afraid.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.340]   Thank God I decided to preach the gospel and not about the Suez Canal.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.100]   How would I have helped you by preaching about the international situation?
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.220]   But here is the message.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.020]   Peace I give unto you, whatever may be happening to you.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.300]   Young men, you may be called to fight, you may be called to the army, I don't know.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.260]   We may enter war, I don't know.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.120]   But I know that what we need is this, peace within.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:02.380]   Whatever may happen outside, and he gives it, his peace.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.300]   In nothing be anxious, therefore says Paul.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.780]   In nothing be anxious, or be crushed by anxious care.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.260]   Whether your husband's going to be called up, what's going to happen to your children,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.920]   don't be anxious.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.540]   But in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:28.060]   known unto God, and then the peace of God that passeth all understanding shall keep
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.500]   your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.860]   That's the riches.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.340]   And then think of the joy.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:44.420]   Hitherto he says, ye have asked nothing in my name, ask and you shall receive, that your
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.020]   joy may be full.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.940]   And the context is in the world ye shall have tribulation.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.540]   But fear not, I have overcome the world.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.780]   Or do you need wisdom?
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:02.540]   If any man lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth liberally and upbraideth not.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.580]   Giveth liberally, you notice, the riches of his wisdom.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.580]   He'll give it you.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:13.380]   Guidance, understanding, all you need in Christ.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:20.420]   And then perhaps the most wonderful thing of all, the ability to be content whatever
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.220]   may take place.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.700]   And Paul says he's enjoying it.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.380]   I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.900]   I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.940]   I can do all things, no limit to it.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:43.860]   I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.300]   What a way to face the future.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:52.340]   Dark and troublesome as it is, whatever may happen, you can face it quietly and steadily.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.740]   I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.660]   This is the message of the Gospel.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.260]   And then of course you will find that he'll transfigure death.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.420]   To me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.100]   Oh, the riches of his grace.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:14.100]   The blessed hope that he holds out before us, that we are children of God and if children
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:19.900]   then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.580]   Though the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb be used and our world be blasted to nothing,
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:32.620]   there remaineth an inheritance, a blessed hope that nothing can ever touch, that nothing
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.940]   can ever rob us of.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:40.260]   Well I haven't started telling you about the riches, but there are some of the things that
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.020]   you find thus in the treasure house of his grace.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:50.300]   My dear friends, are you enjoying these riches?
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.980]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   Are you unhappy?
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   Are you miserable?
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   Are you troubled?
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.980]   Are you perplexed?
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.700]   Do you feel you're bereft of everything?
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.300]   Oh, I say God have mercy upon you.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.180]   With all the treasures they're freely given, we have no right to be and we're a disgrace
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.220]   to Christ if we are like that.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:14.940]   Are you enjoying Christ himself?
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.420]   He stands at the door and knocks.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.080]   That's not a text for the unconverted, it's a text to the converted.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.380]   It's a message to the church of Laodicea.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.660]   He's standing at your door and knocking.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.820]   He wants to come in and fill you with peace and joy and all you need.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.280]   Let him in.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.020]   Do we contemplate these riches?
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.860]   Do we dwell upon them?
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.620]   Are we thrilled as we think of them?
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.380]   Are we receiving them more and more?
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:47.100]   Is your desire for them greater and greater and greater?
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.500]   Do you live for these things?
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.980]   How are you going to spend the rest of this day in this critical hour?
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.900]   How are you going to spend the rest of the day?
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.460]   Is it in terms of the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.060]   Or are you going to fall back on the newspapers or on some novel or on some biography?
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:11.660]   For it all is and infinitely more and endless.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.660]   And are you going to pray and intercede for our fellow Christians in Hungary and in other
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.140]   lands?
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.340]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.980]   Is your desire greater and greater?
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.700]   Well my dear friends, if it isn't, I'm afraid it's because we are like the Laodiceans who
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.700]   thought you remember that they'd got everything and were very rich and this is the message
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.900]   of the Son of God to them.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.940]   Because thou sayest, "I am rich and increased with goods."
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.900]   Because you tend to say, "I'm converted, I'm not like those unbelievers.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.980]   I'm a fundamentalist and not a modernist.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.940]   I'm all right and I can sit down and relax and spend a quiet Sunday."
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:54.500]   If you think so, it's because you think you have need of nothing and knowest not that
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:02.900]   thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.940]   Are you rich in Christ?
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.820]   Or are you very doubtful where you are and what you have?
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.700]   Well if so, this is his counsel.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:19.460]   I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and clothing
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:27.700]   and a garment that shall cover thy nakedness and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:40.460]   thou mightest see, beloved people, there for all who believe in him are the unsearchable
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.500]   riches of Christ.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.420]   God forbid that any of us should live like paupers.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:54.660]   God forbid that any of us should be in penury and need and want and trouble and alarm and
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.260]   unsteadiness and excitement.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:03.060]   I feel that the world is presenting us with a unique opportunity of telling them about
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.020]   the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:11.260]   We are being watched, we are being observed, and men and women are wondering whether after
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:18.780]   all the answer isn't in Christ, but it will judge him by what it sees in us.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.300]   If we give the impression that Christ doesn't help very much after all when there's a crisis,
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.900]   they won't look at him.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:32.540]   But if they find that we are absolutely different from them and maintaining this calm and balance
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:40.300]   and peace and poise and even joy in the midst of the hurricane, under God it may be the
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.860]   means of opening their eyes and leading them to repentance and bringing them to the Lord
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.700]   Jesus Christ.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:58.420]   The unsearchable riches of Christ, let us take of them and go on and tell others about
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.980]   them.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.500]   Amen.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:06.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
