[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   Well, occasionally on this podcast,
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.920]   we talk about podcasting.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.160]   And particularly, we have talked about how dangerous
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.760]   this podcast can be to you if you use it unwisely.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.880]   A pair of episodes comes to mind on this point,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.780]   Seven Ways This Podcast Will Kill Your Joy.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.240]   That's ABJ 1277.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   And we followed that with an episode titled,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.400]   When to Stop Listening to This Podcast.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800]   That was ABJ 1382.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.880]   But today we talk about podcasting more generally
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.320]   in a question that comes to us from a listener named Joel.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.240]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   It seems that podcasting is more and more prevalent
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.840]   these days, specifically as a Christian.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.240]   I see podcasts hosted by other professing Christians.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.280]   The same information is often rehashed
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.820]   and recycled over and over again.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.620]   And much of the information focuses on the demise
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.260]   of another Christian personality or denomination
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.880]   or school.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.000]   This grieves me and I am concerned.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.980]   What dangers do you see in Christians pursuing
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.480]   Christian podcasts for information, learning,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.440]   quote unquote discernment, or simply for entertainment?
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.040]   I see dangers everywhere.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   But that's not unique to podcasting.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.200]   I see dangers everywhere, everywhere,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.880]   because sin is everywhere.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.200]   The devil is everywhere.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   The spirit of this world is everywhere.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.500]   So when I point out the dangers of podcasting,
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.380]   it's not because I'm blind to dangers elsewhere
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.360]   or to the potential good in podcasting.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.660]   After all, as Pastor John is a podcast,
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.060]   so, well, to me, if I presume to be hypocritical
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380]   in throwing stones, I think the list of dangers
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.500]   could go on for pages, because really,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.480]   all you have to do is read the New Testament
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.380]   and realize that wherever human beings are speaking,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.540]   there is a great potential for good and for evil.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.080]   And we do well from time to time to ponder
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.660]   what some of those potential evils are.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.300]   So of my many pages that we could list of dangers,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.260]   let me just mention six in response to Joel's question.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.860]   Number one, the danger of factionalism.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.860]   1 Corinthians 1.12, "I follow Paul.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.260]   I follow Apollos.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.740]   I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ," to which Paul says,
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.260]   "Is Christ divided?
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.580]   Was Paul crucified for you?"
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.660]   What an amazing question.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.380]   Was Paul crucified for you?
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.220]   Where'd that come from?
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.060]   In other words, it is possible to think and speak
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.460]   of human teachers, podcasters, in such a way
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.220]   that you actually give the impression
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.220]   they hold a place for you, a place in your heart or mind
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.580]   or mouth comparable to the one who was crucified for you.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.100]   Crucified.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.340]   Podcasts offer a voice, a teacher, a commentator,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.500]   a critic, an analyst, a scholar, a satirist, a comic,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.540]   a curmudgeon.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.820]   And so the danger exists that we will be so fascinated by what
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.700]   they say or how they say it that their voice is elevated
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.260]   in our consciousness, our affections, our focus,
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.780]   our conversation to the level where Jesus Christ himself
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.820]   is subtly backgrounded.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.340]   And we wake up realizing Jesus has been displaced
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.500]   as the supreme teacher, the pace setter, the opinion shaper,
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.100]   and the thought controller, and value creator,
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.300]   and joy giver in my life.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.980]   And when Jesus slips into the background of our conversation
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.380]   and our thinking and our feeling,
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.980]   and podcasters form the foreground,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.660]   we will almost certainly give way to factionalism
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.780]   by staking out our favorite over against your favorite
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.620]   while Jesus is marginalized.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.260]   Number two, the danger of deprioritizing the Bible.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.540]   I don't just have in mind podcasts
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.100]   which make no claim to speak under the authority
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.060]   of scripture.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.260]   I also have in mind Christian podcasts
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.340]   that amazingly pay scant attention
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.260]   to specific biblical texts.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.140]   I have heard entire half hour podcasts on biblical doctrine
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.060]   that never quote a single verse from the Bible, which
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.220]   means that you can saturate your mind
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.460]   with ethical, theological, cultural, political discussions
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.020]   which never refer to the Bible while claiming to be biblical,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.500]   and thus form the habit of deprioritizing
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.380]   the Bible in your life.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.920]   This is one of my biggest concerns
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.040]   with contemporary Christianity, both in the pulpit
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.380]   and in podcasting, giving lip service to biblical authority
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.540]   while rarely citing actual specific texts
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.180]   and showing that what you believe is really
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.540]   rooted in those specific texts.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.220]   The longer this goes on, the less practical authority
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.320]   the Bible will have, and the easier
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.980]   it will be for the next generation.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.140]   Just wave it off.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.300]   So ask yourself how your podcasting habits
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.900]   are affecting the seriousness and care with which you
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.540]   deal with biblical passages.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.780]   Three, the danger of succumbing to the tyranny of the urgent.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.820]   One survey that I read said that 3/4
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.860]   of those who regularly listen to podcasts
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.140]   do so in order to quote, "learn new things."
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.300]   Now, that might not be a bad thing
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.020]   if it means gaining new insight into ancient truth.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.180]   But if it means a sense of restless desire
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.220]   not to miss out on the latest news or the latest fashion
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.540]   or the latest gossip, then it signifies
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.860]   that we are succumbing to the tyranny of the urgent.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.540]   Of course, there are podcasts devoted
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.860]   to careful, thoughtful, patient treatment
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.860]   of historically rooted, time-proven, perennially
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.660]   relevant truth.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.620]   But they are few and far between.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.700]   The danger I have in mind is a kind of mental disquiet
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.420]   that craves something new, some new stimulation,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.940]   some new awareness of what's happening now,
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.340]   some new juicy tidbit of gossip or opinion or controversy
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.540]   or some new wave of discussion that's passing through
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.020]   that you don't want to miss out on.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.700]   All this restless mental need for something new
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.580]   is a sign that the soul is losing its center
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.820]   and becoming fragmented and thus ever more vulnerable
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.740]   to being tyrannized by the new and the urgent.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.020]   Number four, the danger of being infected
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.900]   with a lopsided tone of life.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.060]   By tone of life, I mean that your mind and attitude
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.980]   and mouth can take on a certain spirit or mood or style
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.980]   or emotional quality that may have a foothold in the Bible
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.260]   but is out of proportion when compared
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.420]   with other attitudes and moods and tones in the Bible.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.580]   This happens most often when we have a favorite voice
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.940]   or authority or entertainer who is lopsided
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.100]   in his or her demeanor and thus represents, for example,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:40.660]   a pervasively cynical or crass or satirical or sarcastic
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.300]   or cocky or flippant tone.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   Or it may be lopsided in the other direction of tenderness
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.060]   and delicateness and cautiousness and ambiguity
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.780]   and noncommittal nuance and squishy middle-of-the-road
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.100]   open-endedness.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.340]   The point is that we can lock in on a certain kind
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:09.300]   of disproportionate tone or mood or dealing with the world
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.580]   and fail to realize that the vast array of emotional depth
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.580]   and diversity represented in biblical maturity
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.940]   and biblical wisdom has been lost.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.820]   It's gone.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.060]   So test your podcast voices.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.500]   Are your favorites glaringly narrow?
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.380]   Are they missing the kinds of biblical moods and tones
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.500]   and feelings and emotions that make
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.020]   for a mature and healthy soul?
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.940]   Number five, the danger of elevating public issues
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   above personal holiness.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.340]   There is, of course, no doubt that the implications
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.180]   of biblical teaching have a bearing on public life
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.140]   and political issues.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.500]   But when you read the New Testament, what you find
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.940]   is an overwhelming emphasis on personal holiness.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.940]   Be holy, for I am holy.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.460]   Says the Lord.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.220]   That is, how we use our tongues toward each other,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.420]   how we handle personal relations in love, how we endure sorrows,
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.660]   how we make war on sexual temptation,
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.740]   how we remain faithful and loving in our marriages
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.180]   and other commitments, how we deal in integrity
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.960]   and keep our word and do everything
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.020]   in the name of Jesus and for the glory of Jesus
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.740]   at the most practical levels of life.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.620]   That's the overwhelming focus of the New Testament.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.900]   I've seen over my 50 years of adult life
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.820]   how presumed public virtue and public position stating
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.260]   can conceal much private corruption and unholiness.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.100]   People like to think that they have seized the moral high
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.260]   ground in public.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.980]   But in fact, the foundations are crumbling.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.860]   So beware that in your use of podcasts,
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.460]   you don't find yourself endlessly pondering
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.260]   public issues while losing battle
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.660]   after battle at the level of personal holiness
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.280]   and integrity.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.100]   And finally, number six, I'll just
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.220]   mention briefly in closing the danger of replacing
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.380]   face-to-face discussions with digital input.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.460]   It is easy to slip into a world of digital information
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.980]   and fascination that is so compelling.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.380]   We wake up and realize we're not making any effort
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.460]   to get together with any real people
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.300]   for face-to-face discussions and real intellectual and emotional
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.620]   give and take.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.580]   It's gone.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.820]   And that's a great loss.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.860]   So thank you, Joel, for the question.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.700]   Those are six of my front burner concerns.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.060]   There are many more.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.660]   May the Lord give you discernment.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.100]   It may be that even this podcast, Ask Pastor John,
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.460]   should be replaced in your life with some face-to-face meeting
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.300]   of the minds with flesh and blood people around the Bible.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.380]   Yeah, all very helpful.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.820]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.900]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.780]   search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.100]   Do all that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   Well, next up, we have a wonderful Bible question.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.380]   That's on Monday.
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.780]   I hope you'll join us for it.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.980]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.220]   And Pastor John and I will see you back here
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.900]   on the other side of the weekend.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.660]   See you then.
