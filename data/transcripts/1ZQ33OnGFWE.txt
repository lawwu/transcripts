[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   What did you think about that reservation article thing?
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.200]   Oh, that's crazy. Well, this is a great topic. There is a guy,
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800]   a pretty industrious kid, it turns out what this kid's been doing is he's been getting
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880]   carbon reservations, other top tier reservations. And by the way, everybody's had this as an app
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960]   idea. Nobody's really executed it that well. I don't want to give any plugs for any apps right
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.040]   now. But he has been selling $70,000 has been flipping restaurant reservations for upwards
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.720]   of a thousand bucks. Chamath, you're very industrious and you're an absurd tipper,
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.280]   100% tipper minimum. I know this because when I paid for dinner one time at Carbone,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.400]   you took me and Phil Hellman's cards and you said, "You guys pay and I'm going to put the tip in."
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.560]   And then I had to sell Uber shares to cover it. That was gross. That was gross.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.920]   I've never had a problem getting a reservation at any restaurant in New York.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.320]   Yeah, they see you coming. You know what they say? 10 dimes worth of wine. I have taught many
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.000]   of my friends how to get reservations. I have a series of tips that I could give,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.520]   but I don't want to give too many of them away. But nobody gives tips to maitre d's anymore.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.280]   Saks, you tip the maitre d with cash?
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960]   All the time. Yeah, sure.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.720]   Of course, right? See, this is why Saks and I get along. Saks is a legit old school guy.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.360]   Yeah, Saks is elite. He's got the $100 bill pressed into his palm, shakes the guy's hand.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.160]   I'll tip the bartender to keep the ice cubes cold.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.960]   The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.680]   There you go. Oh.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.280]   C-note for you, C-note for you.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.320]   This is my tip. It has worked. I'm going to give it out here. And the reason I'm giving this out
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.040]   is because y'all are cheap f***s. Not you, but just a lot of y'all out there. And you don't
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.760]   know the art. In Brooklyn, everybody gets tipped. We tip the phone guy when he comes to fix your
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   phone at your house. Everybody gets tipped. So, here's what I would do. And you can do this with
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.400]   a 20. You can do it with a 50. You know, if you're going to some great place, you can do it with a
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.520]   hundy. You fold it twice, as Chamath says. You put it in your palm. You walk up to the maitre d stand.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.120]   If there's anybody in line, you just cut it. And you go to the side of the table.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.560]   You put your hand on the maitre d stand. You push the hand over slightly. Here's the maitre d stand.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   You just slide your hand over and you reveal the 50. And you say, "I am so sorry. I was supposed
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   to make a reservation. I don't know if my assistant did it or not. She probably didn't.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.680]   However, I'm a huge fan of the restaurant. If there's anything you could do for me,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   I made a stupid mistake to not make a reservation. If somebody cancels, I'll be at the bar. If
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.280]   there's any way you could accommodate me, I truly appreciate only in town for one night."
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.760]   When I say 99 times out of 100, it works. The one time it didn't work...
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520]   How much are you tipping? A hundred?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.200]   It used to be 20 when I lived in New York. Now, I regularly do 50.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.840]   And the reason I do it is I don't like giving money to charity. I feel like these charities
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.240]   are all a giant scam. And I like to give it to service people.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   Like, is it awkward when you tip $50 in ones like that? Like, doesn't it become really thick?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.120]   It's a little harder to hold in your hand. I used to use a roll of quarters, actually. That
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.520]   was awkward. The roll of quarters was a little bit hard. The 50 is easy.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.960]   I'm just asking everybody here, if you hear my voice, please go tip your maitre d 20 or 50
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.040]   and report back if my technique works. Because what you're doing in the framing is you're saying
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.680]   you made a mistake, and then you make it so the person doesn't feel like you're bribing them or
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.480]   paying them off. They're helping you solve a problem. So, anyway, it's kind of like when
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.480]   I troll David and I'm like, "Hey, Freeberg, with the sum and whatever." And he's like,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.600]   "I'll do all the work. Forget about it." You just got to reframe it. All right,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.400]   let's get started here.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.360]   But it is a bribe.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.960]   That is a bribe, yeah.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.920]   It is, in fact, a bribe.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.880]   Yeah. I consider it... It's interesting to bring this up.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.760]   You're creating plausible deniability, but it's still a bribe.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.240]   I consider it a tip in advance of services.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.480]   No, you're not tipping him for good service. You're tipping him to basically break in line.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.520]   You didn't make a reservation, and you're taking away somebody else's spot.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.360]   And you're paying him to break the rules.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.760]   You know what? Your shift to man of the people, it's the most brilliant move you've ever made.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.800]   No, but it's a bribe.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.320]   You're a populist.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.440]   You're not even really doing him a favor. You're doing yourself a favor.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   All right, let's unpack that.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.640]   You're such a populist. That's so brilliant. I hate you.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   He just figures out a way to get those populist votes.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.800]   No, here's what it is. Because I had this argument with my...
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   You gave him the 50 just for doing a good job, even if you had the reservation is what you're saying.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.520]   I am so confident in how good the service is going to be. I'm giving a pre-tip.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.880]   I consider it a pre-tip.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.080]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.920]   A pre-tip if he gives you a reservation when you don't have one.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.200]   I am happy to not get the money back if they can't accommodate me.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.680]   One time it happened, the woman at Asia to Cuba in New York in the 90s said,
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.560]   "Here's your 20 back."
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   And she said, "I'm really sorry. There's nothing I can do. I would love...
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.360]   It's very lovely of you to give me the tip."
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.640]   And she handed it back to me.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.440]   And I said, "Keep it."
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.920]   And she said, "No, but the bartender is going to take care of you at the bar."
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   So that ends well.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.000]   All right, let's get started, everybody.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480]   We have a full docket for you today.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.240]   And story of the week as voted by besties.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.120]   We have a new system here.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.600]   Instead of me sorting the docket, the besties give a thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.960]   This one, I think, had two of three people voted for it.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.640]   One person didn't vote this week.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.440]   And that is Zuck's Scorched Earth AI Strategy.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.920]   As you probably know, if you're in tech,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.280]   Meta was the first big tech company to fully embrace open source AI.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.040]   Llama leaked last year.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.840]   Folks said that it wasn't leaked.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   It was released covertly or on the slide, DL, by the folks at Meta.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.040]   But they just released Llama 3.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   And I talked to Sandeep about this a whole bunch last week.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.160]   It just came out a few days ago.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.360]   And it's already in the top two models on HuggingFace's leaderboard.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.960]   You can take a look at HuggingFace's leaderboard.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.760]   It's basically where it's the most trusted place, I think,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   where people benchmark these things.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.760]   Developers are saying it's faster.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   It's less preachy, was an observation in chat.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   GPT-4, despite being slightly lower quality.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.720]   They also have some small models that are performing really well.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.840]   They also announced, very interestingly,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.800]   open sourcing the Quest operating system called MetaHorizons OS.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.720]   The OS powers the mixed reality headsets, VR, all that kind of stuff, AR.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.320]   But here's the big news.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.680]   This one is amazing.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.720]   Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp are integrating a search box
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.760]   or their AI assistant chat box into all their apps.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.400]   Worth noting, Meta came out with their results just the other day.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.520]   And we're taping this on Thursday.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.880]   As you know, it comes out Friday.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.560]   Their stock is down as much as 16% after reporting its Q1 earnings.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.400]   They beat estimates.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.360]   But Zuck is saying he's going to spend a bucket load of cash on infrastructure.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.440]   Chamath, it's your alma mater.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.520]   He worked side-by-side with Zuck,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.280]   growing Facebook from, what, 10, 20 million to 400 million mouse.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.240]   What do you think of his strategy?
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.920]   800 million when I left.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.480]   Okay.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.120]   What are your thoughts on Gold Chain Zuck and his new strategy to pivot away from VR to AR,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   AI, and going full all-in, so to speak, on open source?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   They're taking a play that we talked about, which makes a ton of sense,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.600]   which is it's not a core market, but it's very important.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.400]   The core money-making market for them is monetizing their family of apps.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.760]   And so they're scorching the earth for these new markets so that the economics are not viable,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.560]   which will, I think, allow a more robust ecosystem where they'll have more of a say.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   Because I think up until this point,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   you could have said that they and Google were sort of lagging behind open AI,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.000]   but I don't think that's the case.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.800]   And by the way, this is the strategy that we talked about 16 months ago
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   that these big companies should take.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.880]   I just think it's worth listening to what we said,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.720]   and then basically what Zuck said just right now.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.280]   Here we go.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.800]   This is a black and white flashback.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.560]   Chamath in a turtleneck.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.280]   Go.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   I think that Google will open source their models because
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   the most important thing that Google can do is reinforce the value of search.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.320]   And the best way to do that is to scorch the earth with these models,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   which is to make them widely available and as free as possible.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.480]   That will cause Microsoft to have to catch up,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.560]   and that will cause Facebook to have to really look in the mirror and decide
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.360]   whether they're going to cap the betting that they've made on AR/VR
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.600]   and reallocate very aggressively to AI.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.360]   That should be what Facebook does.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.880]   And the reason is, if Facebook and Google and Microsoft
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.600]   have roughly the same capability and the same model,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.280]   there's an element of machine learning called reinforcement learning.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.320]   And specifically, it's reinforcement learning from human feedback.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.960]   Facebook has an enormous amount of reinforcement learning inside of Facebook.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.520]   Every click, every comment, every like, every share,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   the huge companies will create the substrates.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.360]   And I think they'll be forced to scorch the earth and give it away for free.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.840]   Now you can see what Zuck said last week.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   Look at this little victory lap here.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.280]   It's probably also pretty bad for one institution
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   to have an AI that is way more powerful than everyone else's AI.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.520]   And I kind of think that a world where AI is very widely deployed
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.160]   in a way where it's gotten hardened progressively over time
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.400]   and is one where all the different systems will be in check
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.080]   in a way that seems like it is fundamentally more healthy to me
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.920]   than one where this is more concentrated.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.880]   - That is, I think, the definition of scorched earth.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.600]   So, and he's running a really perfect place so far.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.960]   He's open-sourced the headset OS.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   He's opening-sourced these models.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.360]   He stopped training, I think, for LLAMA 3.5, was it?
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.760]   And now he's moved directly to LLAMA 4
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.240]   just to try to head off GPT-5 at the pass.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   Well, so what are we seeing?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.880]   We're seeing the economic value getting disintegrated.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.840]   There is no value in foundational models economically.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.360]   So then the question is, who can build on top of them the fastest?
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.520]   And Jason, to your point, LLAMA was announced last Thursday.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.960]   14 hours later, Grok actually had that model deployed
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.080]   in the Grok cloud so that 100,000-plus developers
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.280]   could start building on it.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.760]   That's why that model is so popular.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.280]   So it puts the closed models on their heels
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.680]   because if you can't both train and deploy iteratively
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.440]   and quickly enough, these open-source alternatives will win.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.280]   And as a result, the economic potential
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.080]   that you have to monetize those models will not be there.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.240]   And what that does is reinforce the existing economic moat
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.480]   that Facebook already has in monetizing their apps.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   Now, why the stock went down,
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   I'd like to talk in contrast to Tesla a little bit later
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.200]   because this has nothing to do with that
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.280]   and it's more about squares versus sharps in the stock market.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.240]   Freeberg, your thoughts on meta-embracing going all in on AI.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.600]   You were at Google, your alma mater,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.440]   and you watched them be proprietary and close
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.080]   when it came to search and the search algorithm,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.240]   but open-source when they were behind.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.120]   And that's, I guess, the phrase we use here in Silicon Valley.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.440]   When you're behind, you use open-source to catch up.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.720]   And when you're ahead, you close everything down.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   Facebook famously shut down all access to their APIs.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.880]   You can't get into the social graph,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.200]   but they're going open here.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.640]   Why? Because they're behind.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.440]   Your thoughts on this from, say, a Google perspective,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.360]   and then maybe how Google might react,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.920]   and then just broadly, do you think open-source wins the day,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.600]   getting to AGI?
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.000]   I would say the analogy for Google is Android,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.760]   where Google open-sourced the Android operating system
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.800]   because the handset manufacturers
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.160]   and some of the big software companies,
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.360]   so Nokia and Microsoft in particular,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.320]   BlackBerry, had these closed proprietary operating systems.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.880]   And then the telcos put their apps on and made money
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.800]   and basically had control over whether or not
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.280]   people could access Google and Google services
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.320]   through their phone.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.640]   So the intention with open-sourcing Android
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.200]   was to make sure that Google was not disadvantaged
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   in their core business over time.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.440]   I think that there's a similar analogy here
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.520]   that by open-sourcing these models,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.720]   they limit competition because VCs are no longer gonna plow
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.200]   half a billion dollars into a foundational
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.480]   model development company.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.480]   So you limit the commercial interest
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.520]   and the commercial value of foundational models.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.800]   Now, the CapEx question is a really hard one to diagnose
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.960]   because we don't know how they're spending the money,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.920]   where they're spending the money,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.360]   what they're doing in there.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.520]   I think that it's a really important sign
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.320]   that founder-led companies with these voting rights
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   have the ability to make these sorts of hard decisions
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.640]   that it might be very difficult
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   for a management by committee group to make.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   - Got it.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.080]   - Look at how Mark is making these decisions
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.880]   and Elon is making big, tough decisions
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.440]   that it would very likely be pushed back on
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.720]   if they didn't have the voting rights,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.840]   if they didn't have the control
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.880]   over the company that they had.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   - It's a great point about founder authority.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.680]   I think that's a really salient point.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.880]   Shout out to Zach.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.200]   Would really be great to get him at the All in Summit.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.720]   Sax, we have some breaking news here.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.760]   It turns out Lama 3, they just tested it in the benchmarks.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.920]   It says here you can make the founding fathers
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.960]   any race you like.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.160]   It's a really interesting feature.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.000]   Any thoughts on Facebook's strategy here?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.720]   You are a master strategist, David Sax.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.880]   Give us your master strategy here,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.760]   1700 chess rating, Sax.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.880]   - Well, we kind of glossed over what the real news was,
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.400]   which was that Meta released Lama 3,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.800]   which they had spent billions of dollars creating
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.720]   in a completely open source way.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.880]   And the testing on Lama 3 is that it's comparable to GPT-4.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.080]   And I think this is what Chamath means by scorched earth
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.560]   is that we now have a free model
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.320]   that's as good as GPT-4. - Best in class.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.640]   - Best in class, or at least tied for best in class.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.520]   There are some slight differences
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.960]   and we've been playing around with it.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:39.520]   It is faster and cheaper than using Chad GPT-4,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.600]   but the context window is smaller.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.880]   I think it has only an 8,000 token context window.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   So that's something that the open source community
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.320]   is gonna need to work on is rolling out foundation models
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.080]   of a bigger context window.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.280]   Nonetheless, the point is that at least for now,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.680]   until open AI comes out with GPT-5,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.480]   which is supposed to happen soon,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.400]   the open source community has kind of caught up
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.800]   with the top closed source model, which is open AI.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.400]   - Will they blow past the closed source model, Sax?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   - Well, I still think that open AI is ahead
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   because the scuttlebutt about Chad GPT-5
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   is that it's amazing and it's a big improvement
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.880]   over GPT-4 and supposedly it's gonna come out
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.720]   any day, week, or month.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   So if GPT-5 comes out and knocks our socks off
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.240]   in a few weeks, then we're gonna see that,
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.080]   oh, they're actually a cycle ahead
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.840]   of the open source community.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.520]   But as of this moment,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.760]   in terms of what's been publicly released,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.520]   I think it's fair to say that open source
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.800]   is largely caught up with open AI.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.400]   And this is why, bring up this tweet by Naveen Rao,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.440]   who is a founder who created the company Mosaic ML,
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.560]   which is sold to Databricks or Unicorn Outcome.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   And he says, "I don't think everyone has comprehended
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.880]   "the massive disruption and distortion
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.040]   "that's gonna happen in the gen AI market
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.080]   "due to LLAMA-3.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.880]   "Boats will be destroyed and investments will go to zero.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   "Just like everything in gen AI,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.160]   "this will all happen fast."
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.040]   So it's a similar reaction to what Chamath is saying,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.760]   which is we have a open source model now
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.280]   that erases billions of dollars of private investment.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:21.920]   - And by the way,
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.320]   you just said something really interesting before,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   which is, okay, there's a limitation, right?
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.960]   You mentioned the context window, which was a problem.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.760]   I just found this thing today.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.440]   They solved it.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.680]   Now they're at 96K context.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.800]   - Oh, that's amazing.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.840]   - So to your point, Sax, this market is moving so fast
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.080]   because you cannot compete with open source.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   So all these closed models,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.480]   which means open AI and a bunch of these other folks,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.160]   especially the ones that are sitting inside
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.320]   of these smaller companies, right?
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.080]   Snowflake has a model.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.520]   I think Databricks has a model.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.720]   There's an important question that has to be asked
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   around the economic viability of these models
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.000]   in a world where open source is not only better
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.280]   and better funded, but they're iterating faster
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.600]   and the feature set is catching up to your needs.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.040]   So the minute that Sax says he needs a longer context window,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.160]   within a week, it's there.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.840]   That's pretty intense.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.360]   - Yeah, I think this is like one of the--
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.480]   - What do you think, J. Cole?
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.800]   - Well, I've got a totally different take on this.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.040]   Obviously, I agree with all you've said here
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.680]   in terms of the open source and the dramatic effect
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.960]   it's gonna have on pricing,
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.560]   but there's something people are missing.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.720]   If you go to meta.ai for a second, Nick,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.560]   and you pull it up,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.280]   what you'll see is they've dedicated the meta.ai URL
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.800]   to a search-like experience.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.400]   And then they've put a search box at the top
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.560]   of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.680]   And so they are going to put search engine,
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.520]   essentially, their modern search engine,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.800]   which is starting from zero,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.960]   in front of 3 billion people
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.000]   using Meta's collection of services.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.920]   And so just like Apple and Firefox
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.400]   were able to intercept search traffic,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   I think, and let's make a prediction here,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.800]   that Meta's gonna get 10 points of the search market.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.400]   Now, each point of the search market is worth,
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.680]   you know, what is Google's worth?
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.560]   About 2 trillion.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.400]   If you take out 500 billion
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.760]   for YouTube and their other services,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.960]   you get 1.5 trillion,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.240]   which means 10 points is worth 150 billion in market cap.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.120]   Now, as you well know, Chamath,
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   and you well know, David,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.800]   these two ad networks,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.360]   Meta started with psychographic data,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.800]   the person who they know.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.320]   And then, of course,
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.880]   Google had the greatest advertising product ever,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.440]   intent.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.760]   You type in Volvo, you type in Tesla,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.280]   type in Tesla Santa Monica,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.000]   used, you know,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.880]   you don't have to guess what the person is interested in
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.680]   at that moment.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.920]   Well, for the first time,
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.280]   you know, one of these ad networks
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.600]   has content data and psychographic,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.520]   and they're gonna be able to put it together.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.200]   And I think they take 10 points of search,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.240]   but more importantly,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.720]   they're gonna have data on individuals
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.480]   that will be unrivaled in the advertising space.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.120]   Now, Google tried to do this themselves.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   They did something called Google+.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.000]   I don't know if you were there,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   Freeberg during the Google+ era,
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.760]   they spent billions of dollars on a social network.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.120]   It failed, they shut it down
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.720]   because they wanted to get that.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.080]   So looking at this,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.120]   I think, man, there's so much going on on open source,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.440]   but now Google,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   we haven't talked about Google's role in all of this
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   and Sundar being a hired gun,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.760]   not having founder authority to your point, Freeberg.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.040]   You know, I think they're going after Google search business,
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.280]   as well as, you know,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.800]   taking away and commoditizing all of the open source.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.200]   So we might be sitting here in three or four years
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.240]   watching Meta have, I don't know, 10?
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.480]   Nobody has to learn search,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.560]   it's just that Google can't afford to lose anything.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.360]   Everybody takes a point here and a point there,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.080]   and all of a sudden,
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.560]   Google could be in the high 70s of search,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.520]   and that would be economically disastrous for their stock.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.280]   Yeah, you're gonna have to make cuts.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   Why do you guys think the stock is down?
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.720]   Why is the stock down 16%?
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.480]   I have a theory as to why.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.200]   Yeah, tell us your theory, go for it.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.000]   I think that there's a few times a quarter
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.880]   where you can really see the dispersion in the stock market
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.440]   between what I would call the smart money and everybody else.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.360]   So, you know, using betting language,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.240]   the sharps and the squares.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   And I think Meta was an example of the sharps
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.280]   taking a line, which I think is very accurate.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.240]   And Tesla was the other great example this quarter.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.840]   And so if you look inside of Meta,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.600]   and this, Freiburg mentioned this earlier,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.120]   I think, Freiburg, what people really reacted negatively to
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.080]   was the total quantum of spending
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   and the idea that it's misallocated,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   not to AI, but specifically to NVIDIA.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.320]   And the reason is that,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.080]   and we've mentioned this before,
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   I've tried to talk a lot about this
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.200]   with Jonathan Ross from Grok,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.320]   but AI is really two markets, training and inference.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.440]   And inference is going to be 100 times bigger than training.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.560]   And NVIDIA is really good at training
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.640]   and very miscast at inference.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.120]   The problem is that right now,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.360]   we need to see a CapEx build cycle for inference.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.480]   And there are so many cheap and effective solutions,
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.520]   Grok being one of them, but there are many others.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.440]   And I think why the market reacted very negatively was
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.000]   it did not seem that Facebook understood that distinction,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.280]   that they were way overspending
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.760]   and trying to allocate a bunch of GPU capacity
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.000]   towards inference that didn't make sense.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.160]   And so I think what people were saying is,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.760]   hold on a second, so far, your plays are perfect.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.040]   It's everything we want you to do.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.320]   We want you to scorch the earth.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.040]   We want you to open source the headset,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.200]   but we also want you to understand the difference
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.320]   between training and inference
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.840]   in a little bit more of a nuanced way.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.840]   Build up the inference capacity,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.960]   but spend a lot less money
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.560]   because you don't need to spend it on NVIDIA.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.200]   And the reason is the sharps know
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   that NVIDIA cannot do inference.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.840]   And so I think that's why the stock is down this much.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.720]   And I think it's important for people who care about AI,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.040]   but also may traffic in NVIDIA
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.200]   to understand why the sharps think that.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.400]   And I think several of us have tried to explain it now
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.720]   for the last couple of weeks, but it is miscast.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.560]   And so you're overspending.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.080]   Up next, Tesla earnings.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   Elon's master plan part two is going well as planned.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.800]   Again, this was voted up by our panel here
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.000]   in our group chat.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.720]   Last time we covered Tesla was episode 164,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.120]   early February after a Delaware judge
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.640]   voided Elon's pay package.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.040]   Since then, Tesla has made some giant moves.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.480]   They launched FSD-12.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.280]   I've been using it.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.640]   It's pretty great.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.600]   Also, they cut the price of FSD by one third
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.040]   from 12K to 8K.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   I think you can also get it for a hundred bucks a month.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.600]   And they announced a 10% riff,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   going to cut 14,000 employees.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   Always painful to do that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.160]   They're looking to reincorporate in Texas,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.000]   leaving Delaware for obvious reasons.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.400]   Earlier this week, Tesla shares were down
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.760]   more than 40% year to date,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.040]   mostly due to a decrease in demand for EVs.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.880]   Market caps dropped from 750 billion to 460 billion.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.520]   Shares shrunk 12%
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.280]   when they reported Q1 earnings on Tuesday.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.520]   Investors got excited after Elon announced
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.720]   that Tesla's new line of models
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.560]   could start production at the end of the year,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.080]   or maybe even early 2025.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.960]   He shared some thoughts on the robo taxi or cyber cab,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.600]   which he talked about maybe five or six years ago.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.240]   He has had in the master plan for a long time.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.080]   Chamath, you made some great calls on Tesla
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.240]   and made some great trades there back in the day.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.920]   Your thoughts on Tesla in 2024.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.000]   Sharps love it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.960]   This is another one.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.240]   Sharps versus the squares.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.360]   Why did the sharps love it?
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.520]   Why did it go up and everybody was so confused?
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.720]   And I think the answer is that
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.160]   he's actually executing exactly to plan.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.920]   And so if you're investing in a stock,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.600]   what you really want is a CEO
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.720]   to kind of stick to a plan that is well known.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.320]   So we don't have to actually guess what the plan is
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.760]   because he puts it out on the website.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.440]   Look at the master plan part do.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.880]   And if you start reading down everything
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.440]   that he said he's going to do starting in 2016
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.480]   is basically what it is.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.240]   So let's take the first part, right?
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.440]   What did he say in the first part?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.160]   He said, hey, listen, guys, this is 2016.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   We're going to build a Model 3.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.880]   We're going to build a compact SUV, the Model Y.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.560]   We're going to build a new kind of pickup truck.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.000]   Okay, check, check and check.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.440]   Then he said, oh, by the way,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   we're also probably going to have to do a heavy duty truck
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.200]   and a high passenger density urban transport vehicle.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   So that's the robo taxi thing
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.760]   that he's going to announce in August.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.200]   Okay, check and check.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.040]   And then he talks about the software
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.560]   and the investment in FSD
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.800]   and trying to get to a place where, you know,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.440]   you can just have a much higher probability
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   that it will save you from an accident
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.440]   and it'll keep you safe when you're driving your car,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.720]   which will be a large driver
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.760]   of why people want to buy the cars themselves.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.360]   And you can see like these FSD miles.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.640]   So if you're a smart capital allocator,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.240]   what you actually saw was a dislocated stock price.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.920]   What you saw was a plan that by and large,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.720]   he's been executing on at a strategic level.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.160]   Underneath, there's the vicissitudes.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.120]   What are the vicissitudes?
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.760]   Sometimes you overhire, you need to trim some fat.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.640]   Sometimes you overspend on CapEx.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.160]   Now he spent about a billion of CapEx this quarter
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.520]   on AI infrastructure, so H100s for training.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.800]   But the market saw through it
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.040]   because that was a reasonable amount of money
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.080]   to spend on training for FSD, right?
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.280]   So you can start to see the tale of these two reactions.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.480]   The sharps looked at the capital allocation and said,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.960]   okay, you missed by two and a half billion this quarter,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.600]   but that's going to create a buying opportunity
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.280]   because we think it's roughly mispriced.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.880]   And we think it's mispriced
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.040]   because going back to this plan for 2016,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.120]   this is all the things that we've been underwriting
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.720]   from $40 billion of market cap to 750.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   And now we're getting a 40% discount to buy back in.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.040]   So I think it's a really interesting moment
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.920]   to just contrast and compare what sharps look at
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.920]   and then what the media breathlessly exaggerates.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.080]   And I think what they wanted was to lionize
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.240]   the meta earning story, but the sharps rejected it
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.000]   and they wanted to dump on Elon
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.600]   and the sharps rejected that in size in both cases.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.440]   And it's just a reminder to all of us,
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.960]   be very careful what you're reading
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.200]   because if you just took the headlines,
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.880]   you would have expected the two reactions
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.080]   to be exactly opposite.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.480]   But when you vote with money,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.160]   it's very clear and unambiguous
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.280]   because you actually move in the direction of accuracy.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.880]   And that's what the stock market allows you to see.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.960]   And I think this is a really interesting contrast
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.560]   to compare sharps versus squares here.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.280]   - Yeah, just well recapped.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.120]   For those who don't know sharps in gambling
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   are people like Haralda, friend of the pod,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.680]   who are just the sharpest bettors in gambling.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.320]   Facistitude, that's an unpleasant change in circumstances
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.000]   for those of you who don't know the word.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.280]   Sachs, I don't know if you want to comment.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.040]   I mean, you and I are biased in this,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.200]   with the relationship with Elon.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   Any thoughts on Chamath's take?
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.400]   - Well, I'm not going to comment on the stock per se.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.680]   I mean, Tesla's products are amazing.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.920]   They seem to be really executing well there.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.480]   And I think that Elon foreshadowed
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.560]   on that earnings call what's coming in the future.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.720]   I'm personally really curious about the Optimus robot.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.680]   I mean, that has the potential
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.240]   to create an entirely new market
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   and bring about something
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.840]   that we've only seen in science fiction.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   So to me, that's very interesting.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.640]   I think in terms of the company's problems,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.720]   I think they're mostly dealing with some macro forces.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.680]   So first of all, the GDP growth rate
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.400]   has slowed to 1.6% in Q1, so this just came out.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.280]   And that was a notable slowdown relative to expectations.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.160]   So first of all, you're dealing
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.840]   with a slowing economy, it seems like.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   Second, high interest rates mean
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.760]   that car payments are higher.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.840]   If you want to finance the purchase of a car,
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.720]   your car payments is going to be a lot higher
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.920]   when interest rates are above 5%.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.800]   And I think that has been a pretty big headwind
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.080]   for Tesla and really all the car companies
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.920]   over the last year or so.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.200]   But I would say that I think both
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   of those things are ultimately cyclical
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.480]   and what matters is Tesla's products.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.880]   I would say the only issue they have
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.960]   that's a real long-term issue
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.880]   is just the Chinese competition.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.360]   Companies like BDY are ramping up production
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.400]   of knockoff products at low prices.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.200]   And so managing the competition
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   with China is probably the only one of these issues
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.000]   that's I think probably a long-term issue
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.800]   for them to deal with.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.320]   - Let me ask a question here.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.480]   How do you rank these businesses?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   Energy, Optimus, trucking, ride sharing.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.720]   Energy, Optimus, the robot, trucking, ride hailing.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.000]   Rank those, your number one or two
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.640]   in terms of potential for Tesla, Chima.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   Round the horn.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.080]   - That's a good question.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.160]   - Ride sharing.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.280]   - Is number one.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.800]   - And the absolute probably by an order of magnitude.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.840]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.560]   - And the reason I say that is in order for ride sharing
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.000]   and ride hailing to really work
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.760]   the way that they envision it,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.200]   you will have level five autonomy
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.440]   supported in jurisdictions
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.080]   where, again, if you just look at Pardue,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.200]   the whole point is you can summon a car from your app.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.760]   And if you don't have access to a mobile phone,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.600]   you can go to these bus stop equivalents
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   and just press a button and the car comes to you.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.920]   And so in that world, there's just so much value add
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.360]   in terms of passenger safety and sustainability
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.680]   for the environment and less traffic.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.640]   It's a gargantuan game changer.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.200]   Meanwhile, what you see--
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   - What's your number two?
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.600]   - Sorry, just to contrast, Uber and Lyft
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.840]   seemingly are profitable
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.640]   because they find pricing power to raise prices.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.680]   So if Tesla enters in as a third player in that field
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   and just guts pricing,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.480]   which I think would make sense for them to do,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.680]   I think this thing is just gangbusters nuclear.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.240]   - That's a really interesting point.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.520]   - What do you got, Sax?
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.240]   You wanna run the horn here?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.440]   - Well, I already said optimist,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.960]   but that's based on a long-term view.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   - Yeah, this is a long-term question.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.240]   Based on the long-term, one and two.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.760]   - In the long-term, in terms of option value,
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.560]   I'm the most intrigued by the robot play.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.000]   And Elon has pointed out that once you have robots
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.320]   that are capable of doing lots of different jobs,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.080]   pretty much any job you point them at,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.160]   that we can have more robots on earth than humans.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.400]   So it's a big future market.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.720]   - So you got optimist number one, and who's number two?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.320]   - I agree with Tomas in the short term
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.960]   that ride-sharing could really reach
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   its logical conclusion with robo-taxis.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.880]   Remember when Uber first gained steam
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240]   and people were speculating about
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.280]   how big the market could be,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.520]   there was a lot of giddy talk
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.400]   about how car ownership would change
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.360]   and you wouldn't need to buy a car anymore
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.920]   because you would just use Uber all the time.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.840]   - We called it going full Uber.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.240]   - Yeah, and actually I went full Uber
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   or I shouldn't say full, I went mostly Uber
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.640]   like within a couple of years of discovering that product.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.040]   - Yeah, you were one of the first.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.200]   - Yeah, so I thought the potential was there
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   but the problem is it was just too expensive.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.840]   I mean, Uber is still quite expensive
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.440]   and the most expensive piece of it
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440]   is the human driving the car.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.800]   It's all that labor cost.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.600]   So if you're able to charge for the ride
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.000]   purely based on fractionalizing the CapEx
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.480]   and that CapEx isn't even that high
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   because they're making these robo-taxis
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.440]   pretty cheaply now
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.320]   and you're able to get so much more
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.760]   utilization out of a car.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.640]   - Exactly.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.320]   - Because I mean, how many hours a day
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.440]   do you drive your own car?
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.480]   Like an hour, maybe?
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.120]   - Less.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.920]   - But a robo-taxi--
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.640]   - 90% I think is the number on average
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.840]   that they're not used.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.280]   Freeberg, who's your one and two?
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.720]   - I think the Optimus has the highest alpha
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.920]   but the highest beta.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.760]   So more upside than anything else,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.440]   just unclear how you get there,
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.320]   what the path is
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.760]   and the capital requirements.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.840]   And I think there's going to be
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.760]   a lot of commoditization in this space.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   But the ride sharing is built in.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.000]   It's low beta and significant alpha, so.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.640]   - So you're one and two Optimus ride share?
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.320]   - Yeah, Optimus ride share.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.840]   - Chamath, what was your number two again?
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.720]   Just so I can recap here.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.400]   - I would actually probably pick energy.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.520]   - And why would you pick energy
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.960]   as your number two after ride hailing?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.080]   - I think it's a pretty obvious disruption
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.320]   if, so today in America,
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.240]   if you look at the energy infrastructure,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.720]   the utilities keep raising rates.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.160]   And they keep raising rates independent
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.400]   of what it costs to generate energy.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.480]   There are 1,700 utilities in America.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   They are by law obligated to spend,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   I think in the next 10 years,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.560]   about $2 trillion on CapEx.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.760]   They will pass all of those costs
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.600]   plus a margin to consumers.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.240]   Even though in these next 10 years,
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.560]   the cost of generating an incremental unit of energy
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.000]   will be essentially free.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.800]   So I think the very disruptive play
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   is to take 100 million homes
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.080]   and make them mini utilities.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.600]   - Hmm, say more.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.240]   - And.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.680]   - What does it mean, make them utilities?
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.400]   - Yeah, you go to a website.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.160]   Again, the biggest investment I've made
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.600]   is in a company called Palmetto.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   They are close to now the largest
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.600]   residential solar business in the United States,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.880]   if not the largest already.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.000]   Now, what do they do?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.040]   You're a consumer, you can go and lease or buy,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.840]   it doesn't really matter.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   And we give you a super cheap system
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.120]   that goes on top of your roof,
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.720]   plus a battery system.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.880]   And all of a sudden you're totally resilient
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   and independent of the utilities.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.680]   And we help change the laws
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   so that every time you have excess energy,
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.200]   you can put it back into the grid and get paid,
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.720]   which is called net metering.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.760]   So if you have 100 million of these mini utilities
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.400]   competing against 1700 incumbents
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.320]   that are forced to make huge investments
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.560]   and are mispriced,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.120]   that's an upheaval of an enormous amount of market cap,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.880]   but also an enormous amount of debt.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.640]   There's like trillions of dollars of debt.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.560]   So I've always thought a ginormous directional bet to make
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.240]   would be to go along the disruptor.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.120]   The person that helps arm the rebels in this case
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.760]   would be the person that arms 100 million homes.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.040]   And then eventually at some point,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   just short the debt of these utilities,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.480]   because they won't be able to service them.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.280]   If enough people quit and don't need PG&E and everybody else,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.960]   it'll be just massively, massively disruptive.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.400]   So that's why I think that that market could be big.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.680]   I like the optimist market.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.440]   The only thing that I'll say is in my experience,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.720]   when I've looked at these generalized robots,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.920]   the conclusion that I came to,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.960]   and I could be totally wrong,
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.040]   is I suspect instead of having a generalized robot,
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.880]   you have very specific use case robots that look differently.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.400]   So for example, there's an example, Nick,
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.280]   you can throw a picture,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.600]   but there's something called intuitive surgical,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.840]   which is essentially a robot that operates on you.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.520]   And if you look at that,
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.160]   it doesn't look anything like what you would think
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.080]   a robot would look like.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.880]   It just looks like a ginormous machine.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.080]   And so I suspect that there will be people
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.320]   that become experts in these vertical use cases.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.960]   And that will limit the TAM for a generalized approach.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.720]   I could be totally wrong,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   but that's sort of why I ranked them the way I ranked them.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.360]   But I'm pretty convinced that robot taxis are number one.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.000]   And then this energy thing that upends
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.480]   the 1700 utilities in America is number two.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.320]   - All right, Jay Cal, you are the third investor in Uber.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.400]   Are you worried about your investment?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.240]   As I understand that you still haven't sold, have you?
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.960]   - I've sold slightly more than the majority of my holdings
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.280]   over the years to private transactions.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.440]   And then I held everything post going public.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.760]   And I'm still long Uber.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.240]   I give number one to Optimus by far and away,
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   because I think the build of materials on Optimus
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.440]   could be 10K or less.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.880]   I looked at some of these other startups
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.680]   that are in the space,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   and I've been studying it a little bit
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.240]   just out of curiosity.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.880]   And so at a 10K bomb,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.640]   I think they could rent you one of these
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.520]   for $300 a month or something like that,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.320]   a subscription.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.360]   I think every human on planet Earth
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.600]   eventually will have a robot.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.560]   So I know that's crazy,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.240]   but I think Optimus will dwarf the entirety
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.560]   of Tesla's other businesses.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.400]   Number two is energy, clearly,
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.240]   I think, and number three is ride hailing.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.040]   Number two, energy, fairly obvious what's happening here.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.240]   If you look at what's happening with data centers,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.440]   it's spiked, I think, from like three or 4% of energy now
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.280]   to like, is it 15% Chamath?
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.320]   I think we had a discussion-
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.200]   - Yeah, it's almost, I think it's 18%,
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.040]   it's almost 20%, it's a huge number now.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.080]   - Okay, so we don't tell the two stories together.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.600]   These H100s are beasts, cooling beasts.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   This is like, you can't even,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.760]   Phil Deutsch was telling us in the group chat,
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.080]   like you can't even cool some of these places.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.840]   And what that means is
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.240]   there's gonna be demand for energy,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.520]   to Chamath's point,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.000]   if each home becomes a little provider,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.280]   you know, it's gonna create some regulation change.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.960]   I believe, I'm no expert on the regulations,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.480]   we should definitely have Deutsch on the pod
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.920]   at some point to talk about this.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.960]   But imagine these, like in Texas,
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.400]   they keep having the grids go down.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.880]   And in Australia, they have the grids go down.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.080]   It's gonna be so annoying for consumers
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.200]   to have the grids go down,
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.680]   while demand spikes for data centers,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.640]   all the regulations are gonna get opened up
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.120]   to put batteries and solar everywhere.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.640]   - It's also dangerous.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.720]   I mean, people die when these blackouts
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.600]   and outages occur.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.720]   And also, like we saw in San Carlos,
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.400]   here in the Bay Area,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.240]   Nat gas lines explode,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.640]   PG&E is responsible for forest fires.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.120]   I mean, if you can do your part
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.040]   to basically get off these grids,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.960]   use somebody like Palmetto or somebody else
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.440]   and just get solar, Tesla, and be done with it.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.120]   And at least you're not contributing
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.640]   to some of these downstream errors.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.400]   - Yeah, and so I agree 100%.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.280]   And by the way, if you can make money
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.080]   from your solar and your batteries
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.800]   and somebody else picks up the cost of installation,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.440]   I think there's some arbitrage here, Chamath, to be had.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.120]   And I think that's like what you discovered
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.440]   when you did your first principle approach to this.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.080]   So I think those two businesses will be far bigger
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.760]   than anything else they're doing.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.800]   Now on ride hailing, I'm using FSD-12.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.640]   I have been using Autopilot.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.800]   I was one of the first users of Autopilot
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.320]   from the beginning, like literally.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.520]   And FSD-12 is a significant improvement.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.600]   That being said, all of these systems work really well
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.120]   in a controlled grid,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.680]   like we've seen with Waymo in Arizona
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.720]   and in limited parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.000]   I think that vision is five, six, seven years out
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.840]   from having low single digit percentages.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.280]   And you may have seen Uber has incorporated Waymo
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.360]   and the taxis in London into their system.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.480]   I think Uber is ultimately going to be the place people go
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.880]   to call up one of 20 different self-driving.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.240]   I think a lot of people are going to get there
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.800]   at the same time.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.880]   Wouldn't be surprised if Elon gets there first,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.280]   but I think that's five or 10 years out,
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.480]   if I'm being totally honest,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   you know, in terms of getting to scale.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.840]   So I would never, ever bet against Elon
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.080]   seeing what he's done, watching-
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.680]   - Wait a second, when are you saying
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.000]   that self-driving will be good enough
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.080]   to power just one robo-taxi?
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.520]   Let's just forget about the scale.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.600]   Just like, when will it be good enough
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.680]   to have like a steering wheel free car?
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.240]   - Yeah, so if you can just look at cruise and Waymo
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.160]   and you can have your answer,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.120]   which is today in a contained environment
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.360]   with remote drivers intervening
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.440]   on some regular basis, it works.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   So people are taking Waymo, San Francisco, LA
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.840]   on a pretty regular basis cruise.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.520]   I think I kicked out of San Francisco
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.800]   but in the cruise data,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.480]   there was a lot of interventions going on.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.400]   I suspect Waymo's doing a lot of interventions.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   So I think-
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.640]   - I don't want to be a proponent of this by the way,
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.680]   but bleep out his name,
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.880]   was saying that Jason with FSD,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   they're very strict that you have to be holding
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.480]   the steering wheel and stuff.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:52.800]   - Yes.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.560]   - But you can go to Alibaba
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.400]   and buy something that hacks that, right?
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.600]   - It's a weight.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.720]   A lot of people are doing that.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:58.800]   - I'm not promoting this.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.320]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.200]   - I'm not promoting this.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:01.920]   I'm just saying that it doesn't exist.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.600]   - So anyways, to answer your question, Saks,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.320]   I think today,
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.440]   or let's just say by the end of this year,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.560]   an FSD-12 could be operating in a constrained space
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.440]   just like Waymo is.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.280]   Now to get it to all regions,
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.720]   back roads,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.560]   you know, weather,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.160]   there's a lot of edge cases here.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.800]   So I think the more important question is
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.960]   when can automated be 5% of rides
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.920]   or 10% of rides?
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.680]   And I think that's five or 10 years from now.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.800]   I do think a couple of people
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.320]   will reach that moment at the same time.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.000]   - Well, let me show you a video.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.720]   This is one of my coworkers at Kraft took this.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.680]   This wasn't me,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.280]   but he was riding in the back
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.880]   of one of these robo taxis.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.280]   I think this is San Francisco or New York.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.240]   I'm not sure which one.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.760]   But there is no one in the driver's seat.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.160]   - Yeah, but there's a safety driver
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.520]   watching this remote, I believe,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   which is what Cruz was doing.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.880]   And then when they get to a point
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.160]   where they can't figure it out,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.280]   the human comes in, intervenes.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.320]   - I don't see a safety driver.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.280]   Where's the safety driver?
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.960]   - No, no, a remote safety driver.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.320]   - Remote, remote.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.960]   But I have to say watching this video,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.560]   that is the coolest bloody thing.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.880]   I mean, this is amazing.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.520]   I'll be honest.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.200]   - I think it's underrated
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.960]   in terms of how significant this is going to be.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.280]   - Me too.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.360]   - And look, if this is a Jaguar,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.800]   look at that, it's a Jaguar.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   So you're telling me that Tesla
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.720]   is not going to have something
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.840]   at least as good as this?
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.480]   - Better.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.440]   - Soon?
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.720]   - Yeah, no, I think they have it already.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.400]   If you drive this FSD-12,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.760]   I believe FSD-12 probably could be working today
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.800]   in San Francisco under a controlled grid
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.720]   with the remote drivers like the other people have.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   If somebody knows about this, by the way,
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.080]   can they send us information?
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.840]   I'm Jason at calicanus.com for life.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.360]   Just send me a picture.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.600]   I'll keep it on the DL.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.800]   I will reveal sources of who these remote drivers are,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.160]   what their setup looks like.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.080]   I'm very curious to understand
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   how the remote drivers work for Waymo and Cruz.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.360]   - Can they park the car?
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.200]   - They can take the car with a joystick,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.160]   is my understanding,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.520]   and move it around a garbage can
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.480]   in the middle of the street, Jamal.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.120]   - Wow.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.040]   - And that might be the future of this.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.240]   Like, let's say 10 or 15%.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.480]   Let's say 10% of the time it needs an intervention.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.120]   One an hour, two an hour.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.760]   Having some remote person in Manila, wherever,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.960]   watching 10 videos concurrently
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.280]   and looking for moments to do this.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   - It's incredible.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.960]   - Cruz workers intervened to help the company's cars
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.520]   every 2.5 to five miles,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.680]   according to a New York Times article.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.000]   All right.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.480]   And just if we score everybody's rating here,
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.680]   I give two points for first place,
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.960]   one point for second place.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.560]   Optimus got six points.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.520]   Ridehailing, four.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.080]   Energy, two.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.520]   Trucking, zero.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.160]   There you have it, folks.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   There's your scores from the besties.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.360]   - What is Waymo?
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:43.840]   What is that?
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.400]   Is that like Uber?
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.520]   - That's Google self-driving.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.240]   They spun it out.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.640]   - But what is it?
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.600]   Is it like a service like--
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.320]   - LiDAR, $150,000 cars.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.520]   - Uh-huh.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.760]   But it competes with Cruz?
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.040]   - Yeah.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.160]   They're doing what Cruz did.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.240]   - It was the original self-driving car company
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.280]   that Google set up.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   And then they set up Google X around it.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.360]   - Just explain to me the market, guys.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.000]   I'm not sure I get it.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.280]   So there's Waymo and Cruz.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:07.840]   - It's Uber.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.760]   - But there's Waymo and Cruz,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.280]   which are like, there's no drivers.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   And then there's Uber and Lyft,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.600]   where there are drivers.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.320]   - Yeah.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   - That's the basic, right?
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:16.880]   - Yeah.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.360]   - That's right?
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:17.680]   - Yeah.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.320]   - Yeah.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.520]   - And there's also Aurora.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.280]   I don't know if Uber owns a percentage of that
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.200]   or not, but I think you know about Aurora.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.520]   - Aurora was set up by Chris Urmson.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.240]   He was the original engineering lead on Waymo
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.200]   inside of Google.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.720]   When they did a management changeover,
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.680]   there was a big falling out.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.080]   A lot of people ended up leaving the Waymo program.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.400]   Chris left, took a bunch of people with him
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.200]   and started Aurora,
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.560]   which was basically software to do autonomous driving
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.520]   that they were then gonna license into OEMs.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.920]   So that company got backed by a bunch of VCs
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.000]   and ended up going public via SPAC.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.440]   And it's publicly traded today.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.240]   - Ah, I see.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.640]   - Uber owns 26% of Aurora.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.240]   Or actually now it's down to 20%.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.040]   There's also Zoox.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.880]   - They made an investment in it, yeah.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.440]   - Yeah.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.080]   There's also Zoox, which is part of Amazon.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.240]   So I think there's about 10 people
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.840]   who are gonna get to the finish line at the same time.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.040]   I think it's gonna be a very crowded space.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.240]   - But again, some of these guys
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.320]   are trying to make software for OEMs
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.920]   so that the OEMs don't have to build
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.360]   their own autonomous platform.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.680]   And some of them are trying to make
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.240]   a driving service like Waymo.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.000]   And then some of them are, like Tesla has a driving car.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   They actually sell cars, so different models.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.240]   - Yeah.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.840]   - So they're all gonna converge, yeah.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.080]   - I actually disagree that there's gonna be
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.800]   20 or 30 of these, because I actually think
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.560]   that self-driving is really, really hard.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.800]   And we know that Tesla has been spending years
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.280]   getting to this point.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.640]   And then Google as well.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.320]   So I'm not sure why there'd be more
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.880]   than two or three companies that can do self-driving.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.160]   - Well, there are 10 or more pursuing it.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.880]   I do agree it goes down to four or five.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.240]   And then it's a question of does any,
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   is it a winner-take-all, winner-take-most?
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.320]   And that's what remains to be seen.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.280]   - But I mean, you need a ton of data to make it work.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.760]   - And you need a lot of data around edge cases.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.160]   And so the advantage Tesla has is,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.200]   they actually have real--
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.480]   - They have so many cars on the road.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.000]   - They have real cars on the road
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.440]   with real driver minutes,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.640]   and with drivers using the previous version
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.400]   of FSD and making interventions.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.560]   So they're constantly getting better.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.320]   I think Google seems to be putting enough resources
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   into this to get somewhere.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.160]   But I don't think a lot of companies
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.120]   are gonna figure this out.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   I think it's gonna be somewhere between
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.880]   one and three companies figure this out.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.280]   - Well, Waymo has the most on the road right now.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.080]   I think Cruze is second to them in terms of in-market.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.200]   So the question is, how quickly can Elon get this out?
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.640]   Have you guys, any of you guys
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.240]   taken one of these robo-taxis?
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   - I haven't taken one.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.760]   - No, that's one of my coworkers.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.200]   - Yeah, we've gotta do that.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.080]   - Freeberg, have you taken one?
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.800]   - Yeah, they're cool.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.920]   They just move around.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.880]   - You did take one.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.040]   - Yeah, they're all over the city.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.400]   You can take them in San Francisco now.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:54.720]   - Yeah.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.640]   - You have to download the Waymo app.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.320]   - Yeah, and there's like a wait list,
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.120]   and then you get on it,
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   and they're letting people on,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.880]   and then you just get on it and go for a ride.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.920]   Pretty cool.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.160]   - By the way, someone tweeted something kind of funny.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.520]   They said, "I took Uber years and years
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.720]   "and like a trillion dollars
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.240]   "to finally get to profitability,
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.800]   "and now they're about to get disrupted by robo-taxis."
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.600]   This is brutal.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.480]   - Unlikely, I think unlikely.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.960]   I think it's gonna be a very slow rollout,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.360]   you know, 1% or 2% a year, so.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.600]   But you know, it compounds, and so we'll see.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.240]   All right, everybody, is this a big win for LenaCon?
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.720]   The FTC just banned non-competes.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.160]   Three of three people voted this up
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.280]   of the three besties who decided to vote on the docket.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.240]   Federal Trade Commission this week voted
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   by a three to two margin to ban non-competes
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.080]   to give you a sense of the impact here.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.560]   Estimated of 18% of the total US workforce
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.480]   are covered in some way by non-competes.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.240]   30 million people.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.920]   The ruling bans agreements entirely
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.760]   and requires companies to let their staff know
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.600]   that non-competes are non-enforceable.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.920]   There are a few exceptions like existing non-competes
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.200]   for senior level executives.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.680]   I'm guessing when you buy a company,
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.680]   you can get somebody to non-compete
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.880]   for buying their company.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.080]   The Democratic FTC Commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter,
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.360]   called non-competes unfree and unfair.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.200]   One of the dissenting commissioners,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.960]   Republican Andrew Ferguson,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.600]   said the FTC lacked authority from Congress
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.680]   to make this ruling without specifying
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.800]   whether or not he agreed with it.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.520]   Theoretically, the new rule takes effect in 120 days.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.120]   Wow, we're on a fast timeline.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.840]   After which the vast majority of existing non-competes
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.600]   will be unenforceable.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.680]   Here in California, they're non-enforceable as we know,
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.760]   except under certain circumstances.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.200]   So this is really an East Coast thing.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.360]   People in Boston, New York,
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.640]   they're really affected by this
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.520]   and people will actually enforce these
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.920]   for things as silly as hairdressers.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.520]   It was a big lawsuit by hairdressers
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.160]   who had to sign like 50-mile non-competes
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.520]   with their beauty salons.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.560]   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.000]   it plans to file a suit over the ruling.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.320]   FTC says the rule will create 8,500 new startups a year
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.640]   because people can leave and compete.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.320]   Friedberg, your thoughts.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.280]   In California, non-competes are not enforceable,
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   but outside of California, they are.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.440]   And they're often used like in the agriculture industry,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.720]   in the ag inputs industry,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.960]   where folks are developing new technology,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.640]   mostly at companies based in the Midwest and the East Coast.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.360]   As you guys know, in financial services as well,
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.560]   they're often used that if you work for one company
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.920]   because you have a lot of trade secrets,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.120]   you can't carry them over to others.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.440]   But in Silicon Valley, we're very used to engineers,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.880]   product managers, executives,
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.440]   taking all of the knowledge and capabilities
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.720]   that they've developed at one business
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.200]   and leveraging that into a new role.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.960]   It creates a dynamically competitive marketplace.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.120]   It also inflates, obviously, costs
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.040]   because you're willing to pay more for someone
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.560]   who's worked directly at a competitor
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.520]   and has deep knowledge.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.680]   But they are bringing IP often,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.240]   and there is a real risk that they take something
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.680]   from your company that you've invested in them to understand,
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.520]   and they take it to your competitor.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.440]   So I see both sides of this.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.160]   I think non-competes give companies the ability
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.440]   to invest in employees and feel confident
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.760]   that the knowledge and information and support
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.960]   they're providing to those employees
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.360]   doesn't ultimately find its way over to a competitor.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.920]   And it gives you a rationale for paying more
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.640]   to your employees.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   It actually inflates salaries.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.880]   If I'm fearful that someone might leave
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.240]   and take knowledge with them,
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.840]   I'm going to share less with the employee.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.360]   I'm going to pay them less.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.120]   So I could see this going both ways.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.200]   I'm really fairly torn on this issue, to be honest.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   I don't know what the right answer is,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.960]   or if there really is a strong kind of ethical case
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.760]   one way or the other.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.680]   I think that non-competes can both benefit
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.320]   and hurt employees and benefit and hurt companies.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.640]   Yes, there are unintended consequences.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.760]   Chamath, where do you stand on this?
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.280]   Is this a huge win for Alina Khan, neutral, or a loss?
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.640]   I don't see non-competes having any value in any market
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.240]   except East Coast financial markets.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.400]   I've heard of folks getting something called beach leave,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.320]   typically in finance.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.160]   These are Wall Street jobs, hedge fund jobs.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.280]   So I know it exists there.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.400]   What does it mean, beach leave?
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.080]   If you leave hedge fund A and you're going to go to hedge fund B,
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.600]   they make you sit on ice for six months or nine months,
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.520]   garden leave, I think maybe they call it.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.840]   And the whole idea is that you don't take any
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.680]   active market thoughts to your next job.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.600]   For what Freeberg said,
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.520]   I just think the whole thing doesn't make much sense.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:39.440]   Intellectual property is the least valuable it's ever been.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:40.640]   Right?
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.680]   More people develop things now via trade secret than patents.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.800]   The whole patent system has become a little bit of a game.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.880]   We just talked about open source, right?
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.400]   They have less and less value.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.040]   So innovation is happening in plain sight.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.200]   And so I don't think companies are actually thinking about this issue at all anymore.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.920]   They're paying people because they need to pay more to get the best and brightest.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:11.600]   So I think if you're hoping to rely on one of these agreements, if you're an employer,
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.240]   I think that you should just forget about them and just hire the best people,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.400]   pay them the best and if they suck, fire them.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.480]   Did you ever see that movie, Spanish Prisoner, starring Steve Martin?
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.400]   Great film.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.760]   God, that's a deep pull.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.000]   Steve Martin plays the con man that goes to this guy.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.160]   And the guy is like a chemical engineer.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.080]   Campbell Scott is the guy's name, the actor.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:40.080]   And he has like a process for making a chemical and it's worth so much money.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.720]   And the whole movie is Steve Martin conning him into telling him the chemical process.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.840]   And eventually he took it, he was going to give him all this money, hire him.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.360]   And then he disappeared once he got the knowledge.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.000]   And that was the end of it.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.360]   It's a great, great film.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.720]   Shout out David Mamet.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.760]   David Mamet, exactly.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:53:01.440]   But I think there's a lot of investment that goes into intellectual property businesses that
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.680]   include things like chemical engineering, obviously financial services, trading companies,
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   algos in hedge funds, and a lot in software that if you can access that intellectual property
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.320]   without stealing it, but actually hiring an employee that has it in their head,
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.960]   you gain quite a lot.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.000]   But you can do that now.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   I don't see it actually doing anything bad.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.560]   So I have had a lot of folks that I know in other industries outside of tech or software,
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.960]   where California non-competes are not enforceable,
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.480]   that aren't allowed to go work at a competitor for one year, two years, three years.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.560]   No, no, no, I'm not disputing that it doesn't exist.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.560]   I'm saying where do you see it actually having negative repercussions in California?
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.680]   The point of the fact that it doesn't exist here is also seemingly that it doesn't mean anything.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.320]   Yeah, but the rate of change here is crazy.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:54.400]   Like, the rate at which software changes, I think is quite distinct from the rate at which,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.440]   for example, a chemical engineering process might change.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.880]   Where you learn that process, you spend $200 million building a system,
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.440]   and then that that employee can go and tell it to someone else
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.840]   and suddenly changes everything about that other business.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.360]   So I don't know, I feel like there's something about California software
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.800]   that gives us this, this point of view that maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.160]   But in other industries, it might.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.160]   In that example, you'd still need to have come up
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.200]   with hundreds of millions of capex to implement it, whatever, you know.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.560]   So Saks, any thoughts?
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.400]   I just don't think these things mean anything.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.560]   Yeah. Do you care about non-compete Saks?
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.720]   I think one of the reasons why the tech industry moves so fast
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.400]   and innovates so well is because of the happy coincidence
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.520]   that California doesn't allow non-competes.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.120]   And so the industry's never had them.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.000]   And as a result of that, like you're saying,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.960]   the talent just flows freely to wherever the opportunity is.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:47.760]   And you have this dynamic in tech where the VCs and the talent
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.520]   all swarm the biggest and best opportunities
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.880]   and the newest platforms in a completely decentralized way.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.840]   And there's little or no friction in doing that.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.320]   If you were to impose non-competes on all of the talent,
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.800]   there's going to be enormous delays and friction
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.440]   in them moving around to pursue opportunities.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.880]   And so I think it's been very beneficial to the industry as a whole
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.840]   that we don't have that.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.400]   Now, it's hard for me to speak to other industries,
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.160]   but I think that if you're looking to maximize the pace of innovation,
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.800]   you wouldn't have these employee non-compete.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   So on that level, I kind of agree with what Lena Khan's done.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   That being said, I do think the Republicans' point was well taken
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.080]   in the sense that this was very aggressive rulemaking.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.440]   I mean, I think you could legitimately argue
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.640]   that a change this big should be made by Congress,
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.480]   but I tend to think this is probably a positive change.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.960]   - I think this is great, what Lena Khan's doing.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.920]   And this is two for two.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.840]   I think her Apple action was great.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.960]   I think this is great.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.160]   Love to have her at the summit.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.920]   That would be an amazing fireside chat.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.560]   So if anybody knows her, invite her to the summit.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.560]   There really is three way.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.840]   Oh, and by the way, Chamath,
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.520]   media business on the East Coast also does this.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:07.280]   And that's why friend of the pod, Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon,
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.920]   both of them started shows on the internet, not other networks
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.040]   because they have very tight non-competes and it's pay to play.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.000]   They got paid out their full contracts according to reports.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.480]   And so there is something I think in the middle ground here, Chamath,
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.000]   where if you do want somebody to not compete,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.040]   you got to pay to play.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.400]   In other words, they're getting paid.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.120]   - This is what I'm saying.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.720]   It just tends to be examples, Jason, over and over of markets
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.320]   that don't really matter that much relying on these things
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.200]   and markets that are dynamic and add value in humanity,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.280]   just moving past them.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.560]   So it probably makes sense for all of us to just go move past them.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.760]   - Absolutely, 100%.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.040]   That's going to be great for the economy.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.000]   Sach, you were going to say something?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.160]   - Well, just because these agreements are no longer enforceable
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.800]   doesn't mean that businesses don't have moats.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.960]   It just means you have to look in other places.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.520]   I mean, you have to find network effects.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.960]   You have to find data scale effects.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:06.320]   There's other ways of building a moat besides just trade secrets
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:11.440]   or patents is another category where in the tech industry,
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.960]   patents have never really mattered that much.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.040]   And the only people who are seeking to litigate patents
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.800]   are basically patent trolls.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.600]   - Losers.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:21.680]   - So you want to find real durable moats,
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.720]   not these like legal arrangements that try to protect your business
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.520]   through these types of contracts.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.120]   - That's really well said.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.320]   That's exactly what I was trying to say.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:30.880]   That's well said.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.760]   - Well said.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.480]   Team, product, brand.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.800]   These are the ways to build a great business,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.600]   not legal shenanigans.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.080]   - And by the way, one of the reasons why the industry moves so fast
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.440]   is because best practices get shared very quickly.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   And one of the ways that happens is that
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.720]   everybody is moving around to different companies.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.720]   I mean, what's the average term of employment?
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.800]   - 18 to 36 months.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.120]   - Right.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.800]   And you don't have to worry that
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.960]   if you've got some knowledge in your head,
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.840]   that you don't have to worry that if you use it at some new company,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.920]   you're going to violate some trade secret.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.400]   But the one thing everyone knows not to do is take anything with them
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.640]   in terms of, you know, IP.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.360]   - Not everybody.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:11.840]   Not everyone.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.200]   Lewandowski, was that his name?
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.760]   Lewandowski.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.880]   - Well, that's why it's really stupid.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.600]   - What an idiot.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.160]   Oh my God.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:16.320]   - Yeah.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.080]   I mean, sometimes people do break the rules.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.000]   I mean, the rule is you don't take any work product with you.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.360]   You don't take any documents.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.360]   - No thumb drives, dipshits.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.720]   - Don't bring your old computer to the new job.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.320]   Don't bring any old code.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.040]   - No docs.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.120]   - And there are people who violate those rules,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.440]   and that is definitely breaking the rules.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.160]   But you're allowed to take with you anything in your head.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.520]   And it is one of the ways that best practices sort of become more common.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.960]   - You guys know the story, right?
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   Like Steve Chen, before he started YouTube, was an engineer at Facebook.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:54.400]   And there was like, at one point, I remember being in some meeting where I was like,
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.920]   "Oh, I think we found an early version of the YouTube code on an old laptop."
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.000]   That was a Facebook laptop that Steve owned.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.240]   So I remember like the GC was like, "I think we technically own YouTube."
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.440]   - That's a good general counsel.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.480]   - "I think we own YouTube."
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.000]   Could you imagine if Facebook sued Google to get YouTube?
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.760]   - Speaking of startups, this is critically important for founders listening.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.400]   If you're working at a company, the best practice is,
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.520]   if you're going to do a side hustle, is to get permission and a waiver
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.760]   from your boss that you're working on that.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.280]   - And get a clean machine.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   - And you got to go on a clean machine.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.720]   Your machine is being monitored.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.080]   - Cannot use your work computer.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.320]   - Your work machine, I'm telling you right now,
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.480]   is being monitored every step of the way.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.960]   - Well, it's not just monitoring.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.800]   - It's their property.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.760]   It's their property.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.280]   And if you type on it, especially in this work from home era,
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.640]   and you know, anyway, I had a situation, I wouldn't say at which company,
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   where a sales executive left the company,
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.800]   went into the CRM system, downloaded it, and he was so dumb.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.240]   He had written plans for his next employer on his computer.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.720]   And then in his corporate email, emailed the database
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.600]   and his plans for the new employer to his Yahoo or Outlook email.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.880]   - Oh, my God.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.160]   - They busted him.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.880]   - Of course.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   - They dropped a legal letter on him.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.800]   They put a legal letter on the person who's hiring him.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.280]   The person who hires him rescinds the offer.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.200]   Obviously, they don't want some toxic nonsense.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.360]   And yeah, the person, you know, I have no idea what happened.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.280]   - You know, there's that very famous email that Steve Jobs sent to Bruce Chisholm,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.080]   which goes something along the lines of,
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:45.280]   "Dear Bruce, it's come to my attention that Apple never recruits from Adobe,
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   but it seems like Adobe is actively recruiting Apple employees.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.680]   One of our practices have to change."
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.280]   - That Steve Jobs is a gangster.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.680]   - You know, "Please let me know who," or something like that.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.200]   It's just a phenomenal email.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.680]   - Yeah, and this actually resulted in a bunch of legal action, a settlement,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.200]   because I think Eric Schmidt and Steve Jobs,
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.400]   correct me if I'm wrong, producers,
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.560]   or there was something between Google and Apple,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.160]   where they agreed, and I think Sergey or somebody was--
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:14.960]   - This is true, right?
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.160]   - Yeah, Sergey got in on it and says, "I don't know if this is legal,
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.040]   but they didn't want to piss Steve off
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.600]   because it's not the kind of guy you want to piss off
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.360]   because he can execute."
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.120]   And Eric Schmidt was on the board of Apple at the time.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.680]   There's a very famous picture of them at the Sand Hill Road,
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   or Stanford Mall, having coffee, and Steve is lit.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.960]   He's not happy about this.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.920]   And I think they agreed to not poach a certain level,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.560]   or something like that.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.480]   Oh, there's the famous picture where they were breaking bread,
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.800]   and then Eric Schmidt did Android.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.400]   Steve felt very betrayed by this,
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.720]   and Eric Schmidt left the board of Apple shortly thereafter,
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.440]   because Steve reportedly felt like he was double-crossed.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.440]   But, you know, all that is speculation,
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.560]   so check your own facts.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.760]   - Do you have any other details on that, Freeberg?
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.120]   Do you remember that case?
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.240]   It was after your time, right?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   - I'll tell you a funny story.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.920]   We had a meeting with the exec team from Apple
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.880]   when I was at Google,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   and Marissa Mayer, and Sergey, and myself,
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.560]   and one other person went to the meeting,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.720]   and Marissa's idea was, "Why don't we pitch Apple
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.480]   that we could put a cache of the internet in 200 megabytes,
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.360]   like the most important 200 megabytes of the internet,
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.720]   cache it, and put it on the iPod,
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   so you could access the internet on the iPod?"
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.440]   - Surf the web.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:37.760]   - Right.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.080]   - Wow!
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.680]   - So basically, search a cached version of the web.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.560]   And that was the pitch.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.000]   And they kind of were like radio silent,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.200]   they didn't respond to the pitch,
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.600]   and then they kind of blank-faced stared at us.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.320]   Two years later, the iPhone came out.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.040]   - Hmm.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.200]   I have three amazing Steve Jobs stories.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.400]   I'll tell you one of them right now.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.000]   I was the co-founder of a website called Engadget,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.520]   which was a large blog in the world.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.720]   We wound up selling the collection of those blogs to AOL.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.960]   And I was at a conference, Steve Jobs was there,
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.440]   he sees my badge, says, "Engadget."
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.000]   He goes, "Oh, Jason, Engadget,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.040]   my favorite tech blog in the world,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.400]   I read it every day, yada, yada."
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.800]   And I said, "Oh, that's great."
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.520]   And you know, dah, dah, dah.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.040]   And they said, "Hey, can I ask you a question?"
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.000]   I said, "Yeah, sure, anything."
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.200]   And we're out there, beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.520]   And I said, "You know, Steve, I have the iPod."
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.160]   I pulled it out of my pocket, and it had a color screen.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.760]   And I said to him, I said, "You know, it seems to me
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.800]   that I could download short video clips,
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.680]   like of the Chappelle Show."
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.800]   And I use that as an example.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.600]   And they could sell them to me, like you're selling MP3s,
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.800]   and you could just buy like a Chappelle Show episode,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.000]   it's a pretty obvious idea.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.400]   And then I could play it when I'm on the subway or something,
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.720]   or got some downtime in a cafe,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.240]   I could watch the Chappelle Show clips.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.880]   But could you make a video version of this,
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.360]   since it's already got the storage in the screen?"
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   And he looked at me, he said, "Jason,
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.600]   do you want to watch a thumbnail size video?"
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.920]   I said, "Yeah, totally fine."
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.080]   He said, "All of our research says
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.640]   nobody wants to watch a tiny video like that.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.160]   It's the worst idea ever."
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.280]   And I had this moment of like self-doubt,
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.520]   'cause he had that reality distortion field.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.200]   I go back, I tell my guys what he said,
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.800]   and, "Hey, should we write a story about it?"
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.600]   And 30 days later, he releases the video version,
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.480]   and the ability to watch videos on it.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.640]   He had the greatest poker face ever.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.800]   It was just an incredible moment.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.480]   Man, I really miss that guy.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.080]   What an incredible, what an incredible--
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.120]   Are we doing a walk down memory lane of our Steve Jobs stories?
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.680]   Did you have one?
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   I have two, but I--
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.240]   Give us one.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.280]   Come on, these are great.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.360]   People loved, by the way, the segment when we went on--
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.040]   When I worked at Winam, my boss,
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:55.280]   when it was merged into AOL to create AOL Music,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.360]   was this guy, Kevin Conroy, great guy.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.080]   I remember Kevin.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.760]   And Kevin basically got us runway
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.360]   to launch a 99-cent music download store.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:13.040]   And we were able to use AOL's cards on file,
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.280]   so there was like 25 or 30 million credit cards.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.920]   And we were able to use Warner Brothers' music library,
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.240]   because AOL had merged with Time Warner.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.600]   And so we launched this 99-cent music store,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.720]   and it performed phenomenally.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.680]   And I went and I did demos for Walt Mossberg, Takara.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.520]   I went to Apple.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.600]   I showed James Higa, Eddie Cue, Steve Jobs, all these guys.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.360]   And AOL just couldn't do anything with the data.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.160]   We kept pushing.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.440]   Kevin kept pushing.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.120]   But they were just so tied up in their own political nonsense,
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.920]   they wouldn't greenlight it becoming more than a beta.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.120]   And then nine months later,
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.040]   the 99-cent download store launched on iTunes.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.000]   And I was just like, "Oh my God, this is execution."
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.280]   And they had all the labels,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.800]   and it was a thousand times better experience than we created.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.320]   But it was the first time where I stumbled
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.920]   into something relatively accidentally
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.200]   and just got, frankly, owned by an organization
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.480]   that was just a thousand times better.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.880]   - Zak, did you ever meet Steve Jobs in person?
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.720]   - No. - Freeberg?
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.560]   - Yeah, I met him at Macworld in 2003.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.800]   He was walking the floor.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.840]   It was at Moscone.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.000]   I remember it because I've been a Mac user since 1984.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.880]   First Mac original.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.920]   I still have it in my office.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.000]   Diehard, diehard Mac fan.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.320]   I read every edition of Macworld, Macuser, Macweek.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.120]   And so to meet him on the floor, walking around,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.000]   I was just like a 22-year-old kid.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.040]   I was freaking out.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:47.920]   It was awesome.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.720]   Only time I met him.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.480]   - He was the greatest.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.240]   He was the absolute greatest.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.320]   - I have one other story, but I'm not going to share it.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.680]   - You know what segment people loved last week?
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.440]   - I interviewed with him for a job.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:06:59.920]   - What?
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.480]   Oh, come on.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.680]   You can't not tell that story.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.560]   - Right when I left Facebook.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.320]   - People loved the story last week
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.400]   when we did our childhood businesses.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.680]   - I want to hear the story, Chamath.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.200]   - Come on, Chamath.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.080]   You give us one more.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.760]   I'll give you one that's recorded on video.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.320]   - It's like so littered with my failures
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.520]   and my insecurities, but okay.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.480]   - Good, that's what we want to hear.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.360]   - Yeah, that's what we want to hear.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.320]   - Get it out, get it out.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.680]   - Be self-deprecating.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.640]   - Share with your brothers.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.960]   - There was basically somebody
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.880]   at a well-known recruiting firm
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.680]   who pinged me and said,
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.600]   "Hey, there could be a consult."
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.280]   This is right when I was leaving Facebook.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.080]   And I had a pretty large project
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.200]   that never saw the light of day,
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.640]   which was this Facebook phone.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.240]   Although people in the ecosystem
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.520]   knew that we were working on it.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.000]   So, you know, Samsung and Intel were our partners,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.520]   AT&T and all this stuff.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.880]   Anyways, long story short,
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.920]   there was a rumor that they wanted
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.360]   to consolidate iPhone into one business unit, right?
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.640]   And at the time it was kind of like
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.800]   very balkanized or whatever.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.520]   And I got approached by a recruiter saying,
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.520]   "They're thinking of creating a role,
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.360]   "which is kind of like head of iPhone."
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.640]   And at that point I was like,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.480]   "This is in 2011."
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   And I was adamant that I would never work for anybody
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.920]   until I heard it was Steve Jobs.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.240]   And I was like, "I will do whatever he says."
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:12.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.000]   Whatever, Jobs.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:14.960]   - Wow.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.160]   - I feel that he's asking me.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.600]   - You're ready to bend the knee.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.280]   - Dude, I would have driven his car.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.400]   I would have, "Yes, sir."
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.920]   I would have driven that car.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.720]   (laughs)
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.200]   I was like-
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.800]   - You'd be driving Miss Stacy?
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   "Oh, Steve Jobs, you're my best friend."
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.520]   (laughs)
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.520]   - And I went through a couple of interviews.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.880]   I'm not gonna get into those details.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.040]   And at the end of it, it was like,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.960]   "Well, he's not gonna become,
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.160]   "he's not gonna be the CEO.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.560]   "You know, he's gonna become executive chairman.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.000]   "And so you'll be reporting to Tim Cook."
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.920]   And that's where that process died.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.280]   (laughs)
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.440]   They said I wasn't a good cultural fit for Apple
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.400]   in the new era.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.440]   Now, and then it turned out.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:49.920]   What happened?
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.400]   - Yeah, you would-
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.520]   - Scott Forstall laughed.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.400]   I was not a good culture.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.760]   I would not have been a good cultural fit for that.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.200]   - No, he wanted radicals
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.840]   and Tim Cook wanted, you know, optimizers.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.000]   Yes.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.680]   - So then I went and I started Social Capital.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   But that was my only job interview that I had
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.720]   when I was leaving Facebook.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720]   And it was, for me,
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.360]   I had the same reaction as Freeberg.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.200]   I was like a kid meeting his,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.120]   I don't even want to call it idol.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.520]   Like, I think I was like a believer meeting Jesus.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.320]   - Hmm.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.680]   - That's how it felt.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.160]   - I will save my, just to get this,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.760]   we got to get through two more stories in the doc
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.440]   and I'm gonna leave my other Steve Jobs stories
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.880]   for another time.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.760]   We got time.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.840]   - Well, you have that famous clip of you asking him
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.000]   that question where he basically was looking at you like,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.120]   "That's a very famous one."
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.200]   Because that, you really got the better of him,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.080]   I thought, which is pretty good.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:40.640]   - All right, all right.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.080]   - Will you help companies like ours sell podcasts,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.120]   you know, be an audible?
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.600]   So if we wanted to sell a podcast through your service,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.920]   would you help us do the fulfillment?
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.040]   - You know, we're planning on having all the podcasts
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:53.840]   be free at first,
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.560]   but zing me an email with what you've got in mind
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.760]   and we're open to anything.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.960]   - Same email I always send it to you?
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.360]   - Yep.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:09:59.800]   - Okay, you got it.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.480]   (laughing)
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.680]   - That's so strong.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.040]   I mean, I got to give it to you, Jake,
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.240]   all you have is (beep) balls.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.040]   - The truth is I traded emails with Steve many times.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.520]   With the press, he was full contact, as you know.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.400]   All right, it's time.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:16.960]   - Full contact.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.280]   - It's time for Saks Red Meat
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.200]   and we've got a double serving for Saks.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.440]   Saks stands are going to be really happy right now.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.400]   TikTok's divestor ban bill has been signed into law.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.160]   Senate passed the bill '79 to '18.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.440]   We've talked about this here over and over and over again.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.360]   President signed it, this thing's on the fast track.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.920]   Divest or shut down.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.800]   TikTok bill was packaged, bundled,
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.080]   with $95 billion in foreign aid.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.920]   61 billion for the Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   26.4 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.120]   for civilians in Gaza.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.960]   And about 8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region,
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.920]   AKA Taiwan.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.160]   House added a provision to the bill
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.920]   that would require the president to seek
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.080]   a $10 billion repayment from Ukraine's government.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.720]   Finally, they're talking about the lease back.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.400]   We'll see if that ever happens.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.160]   I'm curious what Saks thinks there.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.560]   Last year, CNBC reported that ByteDance
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.160]   was buying back 5 billion worth of stock.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.880]   And early Thursday morning, it was reported
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.080]   that ByteDance is exploring selling a majority stake
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.360]   in TikTok's U.S. business.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.920]   Looks like gun to the head is working
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.640]   to a non-tech company without the algorithm.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.440]   In other words, maybe they sell it to a Walmart,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.920]   somebody who they don't consider super competitive.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.760]   I'm not sure who the non-tech company is here.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.000]   Could be Disney would come to mind as well.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.080]   And remember, Disney did look at buying Twitter,
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.400]   but they didn't want the toxicity of an open platform.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.760]   TikTok is obviously heavily scrubbed
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.440]   of anything that is aggressive.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.200]   You can't show a movie clip
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.600]   with somebody getting attacked violently.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.880]   It's very PG-13.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.160]   But this is the key part, Saks.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.920]   No algorithm in the package deal.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.800]   Your thoughts on this,
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.560]   and you can take it either way you like,
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.040]   because I know your fans want to hear about everything.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.760]   Do you want to talk the budget bundling
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.640]   or the TikTok ban and the divestiture,
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.760]   which seems to be happening?
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.120]   Well, the overall theme is just
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.320]   that the national security state got everything it wanted.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.480]   It got 100 billion to support forever wars.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480]   It got a TikTok ban.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.200]   And this divestiture thing is a total fig leaf
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.360]   because it's not clear that China's going to allow
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.440]   TikTok to divest because it would set a horrible precedent
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.880]   where the U.S. could just pass a law
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.640]   and then essentially steal the value of a Chinese company.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.160]   So I don't think they're going to be able to divest.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.840]   I think they're just going to get shut down.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.160]   So the security state's getting its wish there.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.000]   And then another bill that you didn't mention,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.960]   which they just passed,
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   is they approved the warrantless spying on Americans.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.280]   So the federal government can now spy on you
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.080]   and your communications without even getting a warrant.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.160]   - Ridiculous, disgusting.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.120]   - The national security state just seems to get whatever it wants.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.840]   And there was large bipartisan majorities follow this.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.920]   And the way they do it is they conjure all these fears
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.160]   to try and fear us into,
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.240]   well, if we don't agree to warrantless spying,
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.760]   then you can get a terrorist attack.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.960]   Well, when has a warrant requirement ever gotten in the way
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.160]   of actually doing what we need to do to stop terrorism?
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:26.720]   Never.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.120]   But that fear was enough to get Congress to authorize that legislation.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.960]   They're keeping us involved in this forever war in Ukraine
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.000]   by this fear that Putin's somehow going to conquer all of Europe,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.840]   which I think is total threat inflation.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   And this TikTok fear that somehow what videos we like
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.800]   is like precious data that's being shared with the CCP.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.040]   Look, I'm willing to believe it's possible,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.320]   but they never proved that.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.480]   - Oh, no, they proved that data.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.200]   It's been proved that they spied on us.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.240]   - No, you only showed us, we debated this, we debated this.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:58.480]   - Yeah.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.440]   - You showed one article from the New York Times about how,
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.920]   yeah, that's not proof, Jekyll.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.680]   Those were two rogue employees who shared some data with certain New York Times reporters.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.640]   - I spoke to multiple TikTok employees myself personally,
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.200]   and they told me that the Chinese representatives
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.520]   are all over the company and inside of it.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.120]   Freeberg, are your thoughts?
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.040]   - But what was the judicial process or legislative process to prove that?
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.120]   Did they have hearings, did they prove that?
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.640]   I understand that, you know, your hearsay and your view is good enough to ban it,
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.840]   but I'd actually like to see some proof.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.000]   - No, my position on banning, thanks for asking,
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.520]   is based on reciprocity and the potential damage it could do,
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.480]   and based on how influential and powerful the product is,
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.440]   and how they could change sentiment and censorship.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.560]   And the Chinese government is fantastic at censorship,
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.140]   and they're doing massive censorship inside the app, yeah.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.800]   - Handle it in a trade bill then, because handle it in a trade bill,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.920]   because what we've authorized here is not a TikTok ban,
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:03.600]   it is a sweeping new federal power to ban foreign adversary-controlled applications.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.360]   That's the new category.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.040]   So we have a new category of foreign-controlled apps, whatever that means,
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.880]   and the government can now use it to shut down apps they don't like.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.760]   And I guarantee you, I think here's where this goes next.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.680]   I think Telegram is next on the hit list.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.280]   You have a Russian founder, okay?
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.200]   You have rumors for years, I'd say unproven,
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.000]   that somehow Telegram's been backdoored by the Russian government.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.320]   You know, we've all heard those rumors.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.160]   It's kind of like the CCP.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.240]   - Where is his base, though?
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.760]   Isn't he out of there?
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.880]   He's in Monaco or something?
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.680]   He doesn't live there.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.640]   - Who cares?
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.120]   - No, he lives in Dubai.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.400]   - He lives in Dubai, yeah.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.160]   - Here's what you're gonna see.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.720]   You're gonna see, at some point, you'll see a media campaign
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.200]   that'll be promoting the idea that Telegram is used by Hamas,
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.240]   by terrorists, by groups that the U.S. doesn't like,
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.280]   and that it's backdoored by Russia,
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.680]   and that it's got some shady investors on its cap table.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.360]   And no politician's gonna want to stand up and defend Telegram.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.920]   And all the industry money that flows into Washington
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.000]   will be promoting this idea that we have to ban it,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.640]   because think about the market share gains
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.640]   that all of Telegram's competitors will make,
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.320]   and they're the ones wired into D.C.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.000]   So this is a foregone conclusion, I think.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.120]   - But you also said on Twitter,
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.840]   you thought this would come to X and to Rumble.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.400]   You actually think they'll take this to American companies?
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.440]   - I think that--
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.400]   - That seems like a stretch.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.920]   - Not really.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.800]   I think that the first step is you go get Telegram,
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.400]   because that's easy, you know?
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.640]   This guy is an agent of Putin, obviously.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.320]   And anyone who says differently
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.840]   is themselves an agent of the Kremlin.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.800]   - How does it jump to X and Rumble?
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.640]   - That's how this rhetoric works.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.680]   So first of all, they'll whack Telegram.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.800]   And by the way, we all know
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.720]   that companies are gonna benefit enormously
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.160]   by slurping up that market share.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.960]   And then if Biden wins a second term,
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.240]   they will eventually set their gun sights on X.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.680]   But look, that's a battle,
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.280]   because in X, you have a billionaire who has resources,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.880]   who's willing to stand on his hind legs and fight.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.520]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.520]   - And so they're not gonna do that before the election.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.600]   But look, if we continue to see
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.360]   more weaponization and more censorship,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.600]   I believe that eventually what they will do
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.080]   is try and push Elon to divest X.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.120]   And look, all they gotta do, listen, J-Cal,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.760]   this act empowers the Attorney General
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.520]   to open an investigation.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.160]   So I think that in a second Biden term,
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.920]   they will open an investigation
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.040]   and just start ratcheting up the pressure on Elon
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   to get rid of X, because that's clearly what they want.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.280]   - Yeah, and the TikTok guy's bought off Trump already,
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.120]   so he's gonna fight for it.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.720]   Freeberg, your thoughts?
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.600]   - I don't agree that the Chinese government
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.280]   will shut it down.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.360]   I certainly don't have any insight
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.360]   into what the Chinese government is discussing
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.400]   or thinking about doing,
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.040]   but there's a lot of money to be made here.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.360]   So if I'm ByteDance, I'm very likely gonna hire
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.680]   a bunch of bankers, run an auction process,
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.600]   and sell this thing, and I have a year to do it.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.760]   This is a business that did $14 billion in revenue last year,
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.440]   according to a published report.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.240]   170 million Americans are active users of TikTok.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.960]   Our revenue grew 40% plus last year.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.720]   So I don't know how they would just say,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.360]   "Hey, let's write this thing off and shut it down,"
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.840]   when we could probably generate--
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.440]   - I'm basing that statement on published reports
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.160]   that China has said they're opposed
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.720]   to the forced sale of TikTok in the US.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.120]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.240]   - And look, I agree with you that it might change,
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.240]   but think about it, if you're the Chinese government,
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.840]   you're adamantly opposed to this,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.280]   you don't like the precedent,
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.520]   and you don't really care about tech entrepreneurs
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.000]   getting rich.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:46.960]   - So let's assume--
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.480]   - I mean, the founder/CEO of TikTok lives in Singapore.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.120]   - Right.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.800]   - So why would they give a shit?
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.120]   - But now let's assume that they let it go through.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.520]   Think about the implications.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs get hired
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.800]   to run a joint process to auction this thing off, right?
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.360]   They're gonna run this process for a period of months.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.720]   There's only a certain number of folks
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.880]   that could actually make a bid to buy this thing.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.360]   Maybe some of the big guys in private equity,
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.240]   Silver Lake and others,
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.920]   try and pull some capital together to buy it,
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.640]   but I think it's more likely a big company tries to buy it.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Cepheus and Antitrust will probably not be
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.080]   as relevant here as it normally would be.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.120]   Certainly Cepheus wouldn't be
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.560]   'cause it's being completely divested.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.600]   Antitrust, there's a real question
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.360]   on whether they're gonna be given some leeway.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.640]   But even if Antitrust does apply,
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.880]   who could buy TikTok in the US?
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.920]   There's only a handful of companies that could or would.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.680]   Oracle, maybe Microsoft?
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.320]   They said it's not a tech, is the report.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.400]   That it's not a what?
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.680]   Not a tech company.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.360]   So that would be Walmart, Disney,
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.480]   you start to get to over--
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.920]   Maybe a media company, right?
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.320]   Yeah, so--
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.040]   Absolutely.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.440]   I do think that there's a really interesting--
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.000]   Netflix.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.920]   Maybe Netflix.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.160]   So I think that there's a really interesting rewrite
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.080]   of the landscape a little bit here,
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.200]   where some of the traditional big tech companies,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.960]   Meta, Google, have really had total control
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.200]   over the consumer media consumption on the internet
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.640]   that there's gonna be a real difference here
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.160]   that might be triggered
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.000]   in how the industry kind of is sorted
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.680]   based on the TikTok auction,
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.720]   if it does happen.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.760]   And I think it's probably--
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.640]   Look, we could argue all day
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.160]   about what the Chinese are gonna do.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.440]   But if it does go through,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.960]   the next story you're gonna see
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.760]   in the Wall Street Journal
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.120]   is how much money the bankers are gonna make
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.400]   on fees running the auction here.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.360]   And then the next story you'll see after that
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.160]   is gonna be about how the tech and media landscape
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.760]   has been reshuffled and rewritten
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.720]   by the TikTok deal.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.120]   Chamath Palihapitiya, our Chairman Dictator,
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.800]   can't wait to see you at poker tonight.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.400]   What are your thoughts on this, if any?
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.840]   I think the thing to keep in mind
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.160]   is that the reason why the government
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.120]   is banning TikTok,
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.360]   and I'm totally speculating and guessing,
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.680]   has nothing to do with these silly little videos.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.720]   But it is that the overwhelming majority
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.480]   of the people that download TikTok
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.600]   keep the microphone on,
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.360]   and it is an ambient passive surveillance device.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.520]   And I think to the extent that
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.160]   a foreign government has access
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.120]   to whatever you hear ambiently and randomly
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.800]   while the app is not even being used
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.640]   is the real problem here.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.840]   And so I think that that's effectively
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.840]   what this is, is a listening device
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.440]   into enough Americans.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.280]   And I think that that's pretty scary to folks.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.200]   The second thing is with respect
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.040]   to the actual product itself,
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.280]   in the absence of that algorithm,
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.960]   which I think is just incredible,
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.000]   as somebody who was a voracious user of that app
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.960]   until I deleted it,
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.600]   I don't think the product is much of anything.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.760]   It's probably no better or no worse
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.880]   than shorts or reels
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.640]   or some of these other alternatives.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.480]   So I don't see the economic justification
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.720]   for anybody who already has one of these assets
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.440]   to buy these things
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.000]   because the content is roughly the same now.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.800]   It is the thing that makes that app is the alga.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.280]   But the videos are everywhere.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.240]   They're on YouTube.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.160]   They're on Instagram.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.000]   They're everywhere.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.800]   They're everywhere.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.440]   So I don't see why anybody
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.720]   would pay a lot of money for this,
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.040]   especially in the absence of the algorithm.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.240]   This is my honest thought.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.280]   What do you think, Jake?
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.400]   I think this is a security risk.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.080]   I've made that clear here before.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.920]   And I don't think we would ever allow Iran,
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.320]   North Korea, Russia
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.520]   to run any of these companies inside of America,
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.760]   nor would they allow us to run Facebook,
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   X, et cetera, in their countries.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.920]   So I think reciprocity is the key.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.560]   But I am running a little test right now.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.440]   I posted this video to my TikTok today.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.840]   And it's under review.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.120]   They won't let it publish.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.440]   And the video is very simple.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.000]   It quotes a study from Reuters.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.720]   You don't have to play it.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.040]   I'll explain what I said in it.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.160]   But I just took a video of the Reuters study.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.440]   What this Reuters study shows you,
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.640]   pull up the chart there, Nick,
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.400]   is that in this Reuters study,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.840]   the CCP is censoring sensitive topics related to China.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.200]   And so if you want to understand why the CEO,
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.120]   who I think you may have worked with before,
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.880]   Chamath, at Facebook,
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.440]   the CEO is saying it's a ban
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.880]   when in fact it's a divestiture.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.560]   If you want to understand why they care about this,
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.200]   it's because they want to be able
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.800]   to influence things in America.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   They want to have data on Americans.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.760]   It's spyware.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.720]   That's my position.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.760]   And it's the most censored platform,
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.440]   I think, in America,
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.760]   which I know you feel passionately about, Sax.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.080]   So I did this video,
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.200]   and just like COVID-19 was blocked on X,
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.040]   here in America, in the US,
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.160]   if you talked about Wuhan,
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.920]   if you talked about any of these topics,
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.920]   our government banned it.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.760]   Well, if you talk about Hong Kong,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.040]   if you talk about Uyghurs,
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.920]   if you talk about Tiananmen Square,
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.240]   your video will not be posted.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.480]   In fact, my video is held right now.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.640]   So, if you're hearing my voice right now,
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.400]   I'm doing a little experiment.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.680]   I want everybody to post that chart
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.280]   and just read the Wikipedia page,
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.360]   maybe talk about Tank Man,
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.800]   talk about the Hong Kong riots,
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.280]   and then use the hashtag #DontBanTikTok
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.920]   as a little bit of a cheeky way
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.760]   for us all to track each other's.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.400]   And I want to see if 100 or 1,000 all-in fans
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.320]   post one of these,
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.200]   if they all get banned,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.080]   or if we can see any of them
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.240]   so we can do a live censorship test.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.040]   Here in America,
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.560]   are Americans allowed to talk
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.520]   about Tiananmen Square,
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.720]   the Hong Kong riots,
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.240]   Uyghurs, or any of those things?
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.800]   And you can also,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.720]   if you want,
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.080]   hat mention me.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.080]   I'm @JasonCalacanis on TikTok.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.600]   So, that's my position on it.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.680]   I want to see this thing banned immediately
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.240]   or divested.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.280]   I would prefer it be divested,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.600]   because I think people love it.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.720]   One quick thing.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.480]   I think what Zak said is really interesting
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.400]   about them then going after Telegram.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.480]   The big issue that I think Telegram
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.440]   has always had
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.480]   is that it is encrypted,
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.520]   but it has its own form of encryption
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.120]   that they rolled themselves, right?
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.640]   Like, typically, I think WhatsApp
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.080]   and a lot of these other folks
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.440]   just use pretty standard signal.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.760]   I think as well use SHA-256 encryption,
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.800]   which is like pretty standard.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.920]   But there is always a fear
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.880]   that the US government
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.640]   actually can unencrypt that
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.080]   and has some kind of a backdoor.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.240]   That was always the fear of that SHA-256.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.080]   And so, Pavel Durov and his team
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.680]   basically rolled his own,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.080]   which is also 256-bit symmetric encryption,
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.600]   but different standard altogether.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.760]   And what people would say is,
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.200]   "Hold on, he has the backdoor,
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:35.920]   disaccess point."
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.200]   So that was always the claim,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.240]   counterclaim between
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.200]   these things of why Telegram
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.720]   was always painted
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.080]   in more of a sketchy corner.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.040]   I'm not saying that it's true.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.400]   And I think that if they go after it,
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.280]   I think it's because
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.880]   this underlying encryption model
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.800]   is something that we can't get access to.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.240]   And so they'd rather just eliminate it
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.280]   to your disaccess point.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.800]   All right.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.640]   I think Telegram can stick its
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.320]   head between his legs
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.520]   and kiss his ass goodbye,
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.240]   because they're next on the hit list.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.160]   All right, we're going to see.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:06.960]   What do you think of my
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.520]   "Don't ban TikTok" challenge?
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.080]   The national security state has used fears,
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.480]   like the one that Jake helped explain,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.880]   to get a new power.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.800]   And it's not a power to ban TikTok.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.200]   It's a power to ban any foreign-controlled app.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   So goodbye, Telegram.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.640]   What do you think of my
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.560]   "Don't ban TikTok" challenge, Saks?
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.240]   The censorship challenge.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.560]   Yeah, I mean, fine, whatever.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.160]   Wow.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.080]   You're so passionate about censorship.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.000]   It's done. It's over. It's over.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.600]   Look, the national security state
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.560]   gets whatever it wants.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.520]   It's pretty clear.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.800]   Not if we stay vigilant.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.000]   I mean, if we keep talking about this.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:40.560]   Well, how did this
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.760]   warrantless spying thing happen?
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.160]   I mean, look,
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.280]   I think the warrantless spying
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.040]   is actually worse than the TikTok ban.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.280]   Me too. A hundred times worse.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.320]   How are they not required
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.080]   to go to court to get a warrant?
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.440]   That's so easy, by the way.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.800]   Have we eliminated
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.840]   the physical courts entirely?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.440]   We don't need those anymore either?
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.640]   They can just do whatever they want?
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.400]   Well, I think we still have FISA,
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:58.960]   but you don't have to go
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.080]   to the court to get a warrant.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.360]   They can just do whatever they want.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.320]   We need to —
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.600]   let's take a deep dive on that
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.720]   in a future episode,
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.520]   because we're running out of time.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:05.840]   We really should.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.880]   One more story to get to.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.160]   Yeah, let's deep dive it.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.360]   Listen, there's a lot of topics
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.640]   people want us to talk about,
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.440]   and this one, I think,
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.480]   people are talking about a whole bunch.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.440]   It's kind of breaking.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.400]   I haven't —
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.000]   couldn't find a Wall Street Journal
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.520]   or a Washington Post covering this,
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.640]   but a lot of people were
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.080]   talking about it on X.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.240]   Biden's 2025 budget
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.880]   includes some serious capital gains hikes.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.040]   There are three proposals
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.720]   in the 2025 budget —
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.800]   we'll put all the links in the show notes —
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.320]   to increase cap gains rates
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.640]   as opposed to income cap gains.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.440]   If all three are passed, big if,
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.480]   it would more than double
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.080]   the long-term capital gains tax
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.040]   to almost 45 percent.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:45.680]   Important to note,
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.360]   this only covers those making
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.880]   one million or more a year,
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.920]   which is like,
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.600]   you know, less than 1% of the country,
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.320]   way less.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320]   And so this is definitely
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.760]   a tax-the-rich idea here.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.160]   Currently, the highest
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.400]   long-term capital gains rate is 20%,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.840]   which is really about 24%
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.520]   if you earn more than 200k per year,
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.120]   because you have to pay an extra small tax.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.880]   If these proposals become law, big if,
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.240]   it would create the highest cap gains rate
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.000]   in 100 years.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:14.720]   Here's the chart.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.760]   This comes from Americans for Tax Reform,
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.440]   which was done by a Reagan-era,
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.880]   an NGO, I think,
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   that was formed by a former
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.320]   Reagan administration.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   They basically make politicians sign
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.520]   that they won't increase taxes.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.520]   The budget also proposes
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.000]   a 25% unrealized cap gain tax.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.520]   This would be a tax on total income,
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.720]   including unrealized cap gains
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.640]   for all taxpayers worth over $100 million.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.080]   Okay, Sachs,
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.400]   I know this is your red meat.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.440]   There's a lot of pieces here,
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.520]   but gosh, this is crushing
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.960]   for those folks
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.240]   who want to vote for Biden
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.120]   but are moderates,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.640]   because this is like
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.840]   the number one thing you can do
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.520]   to stop innovation
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.640]   and investment in the country,
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.600]   which we desperately need.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.560]   This is a head scratcher.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.480]   - Biden is playing a game of chicken
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.840]   with the tech industry
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.720]   and with, I'd say,
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.720]   suburban voters in general.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.320]   I mean, is this what you want?
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.440]   At some point, you're going to have to
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.840]   say that this is not okay.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.080]   I mean, first of all,
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.520]   you've got this 25% unrealized gains tax,
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.280]   which is a wealth tax.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.000]   If you're somebody
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.680]   who's created a small business
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.040]   or a family farm,
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.560]   or you're a tech founder,
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.240]   if you get to qualify for the amount,
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.760]   then you've got to pay 25%.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.320]   And in order to raise the money
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.040]   for that 25%,
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.760]   you're going to get taxed on,
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.800]   let's say you try to sell
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.920]   25% of the company,
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.760]   you're now going to get taxed
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.240]   45% of that,
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.560]   plus 13.3% California.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.680]   So really, you're going to have to sell
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.160]   more like 40% of the company
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.320]   just to pay off this unrealized gains tax.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.040]   And by the way,
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.320]   you haven't made a dime yet.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.360]   You haven't put a dollar
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.160]   in your bank account.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.160]   And that's your one confiscation.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.120]   That's your one.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.000]   What about what happens
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:52.800]   the following year?
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.120]   It's the actual same thing.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.400]   This is this is ridiculous.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.520]   These things will never pass.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.480]   I mean, let me tell you,
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.040]   I mean, so,
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.200]   so this is in Biden's budget
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:01.920]   for next year.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.280]   And this idea,
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.080]   this is not the first time
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:04.880]   we've seen this.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.160]   It was in his original
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.920]   build back better proposal.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.360]   And the only reason that failed
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.280]   is because mansion and cinema
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.160]   voted against it.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.080]   So mansion and cinema
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:14.640]   are not going to be
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.480]   in the Senate next year.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.600]   Okay, they're not running
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.240]   for reelection.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.440]   So if the Democrats
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.040]   have the trifecta,
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.720]   if Biden wins reelection
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.160]   and holds on to the Senate
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:24.800]   and House,
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.560]   but without mansion and cinema,
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.240]   I think you have to price in
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.840]   the strong possibility
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.640]   that this passes.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.600]   I don't think
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.720]   you can just shrug it off.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.800]   - Freeberg, your thoughts?
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.680]   Well, we're talking about it here.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.560]   We're not shrugging it off.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.200]   This is like five along fire here on X.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.160]   Everybody's talking about it.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.520]   Freeberg, your thoughts?
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.360]   - There was a poll published yesterday.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.200]   Bloomberg News morning consult
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.000]   surveyed 4,900 registered voters
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.280]   in seven swing states.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.160]   And the poll showed
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.600]   that 77% of registered voters
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.480]   in those states
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.920]   support basically an asset tax
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.640]   on ultra high net worth people,
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:06.000]   people worth over $100 million
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.440]   to keep social security intact.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.040]   So I think that's a strong indication
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.280]   of where things are headed generally.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.800]   We can debate the tactics
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.560]   and the nuance of this election cycle,
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560]   but as we all have talked about and know,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.040]   social security becomes de facto bankrupt
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.760]   by 2033, perhaps earlier.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.320]   So we have a few years to figure out
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.240]   whether we cut social security benefits
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.440]   in this country
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.760]   or find alternative ways to fund it.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.000]   And it's pretty evident from this poll
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.920]   that Americans are not in support
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.280]   of raising the minimum age from 67 to 69,
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.880]   which was one of the questions in here.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.240]   Only 25% of Americans
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.800]   support raising the minimum age
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.840]   for social security from 67 to 69.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:56.880]   Meanwhile, 77% strongly support
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.280]   a tax on ultra high net worth
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.600]   to fund the gap and the funding need.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.640]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's a loaded question
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.120]   because you're basically positioning this tax,
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.400]   which is really complicated in the details
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.000]   and the person getting asked the question
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.440]   doesn't understand it,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.760]   compared to the most popular program
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.520]   that the federal government has,
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.880]   which is social security.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.200]   So obviously it's gonna pull that way.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.600]   I mean, look, you can ask a question
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.200]   in a way on a poll
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.040]   to get whatever answer you wanna get to.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.560]   I can basically prove to you
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   that a majority of the American public
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.640]   is either for Ukraine funding
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.240]   or against Ukraine funding,
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.840]   depending on how you ask the question.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.600]   And look, yeah, obviously taxing people
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.680]   with $100 million of paper wealth
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.800]   is gonna be more popular
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.600]   than sacrificing your social security, obviously,
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.480]   but that doesn't mean
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.640]   that this is a good proposal economically at all.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.480]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.640]   And I don't think that that's what really matters.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.720]   I think most folks are voting for themselves,
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.720]   their particular needs,
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:03.520]   and the majority of people need more support.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.400]   - This is not even gonna save social security.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.760]   I mean, what is this tax gonna get us?
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.240]   It's gonna destroy the startup ecosystem.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.600]   It's not gonna balance the budget.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.680]   We're still spending way too much for that.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.840]   It doesn't pay down the debt.
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:19.360]   It doesn't save social security.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.120]   It's just more and more taxes.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.440]   - Yeah, I think that's the inevitable trend.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.600]   I'm just saying, I don't know how it's gonna manifest,
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.720]   but I think it's inevitable
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.800]   that we're gonna raise federal revenue
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.320]   through some form of taxation
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.080]   that's gonna feel deeply uncomfortable
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.760]   and inappropriate,
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.640]   and it's gonna have negative economic consequences.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.480]   And this is where the economic spiraling
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   that Malay has talked about.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.720]   - But Balaji actually had a brilliant blog post
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.600]   about this called, "All It Takes Is All You Got."
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.640]   And what he pointed out is,
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.040]   he was talking about the federal government's
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.080]   runaway deficits and debt and borrowing,
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.240]   and somebody responded to him with this chart
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.480]   that shows assets versus liabilities.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:07.120]   This guy, Brent, who I guess is a foil on X for Balaji,
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.360]   sometimes, said, "Oops, you only showed
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.480]   "one side of the balance sheet.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.520]   "Common mistake, though."
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.280]   Basically saying that Balaji didn't know
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.160]   what he was talking about
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.400]   because Balaji was only showing the red,
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.560]   which is the government liabilities,
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.760]   the government debt.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.200]   And he showed that, "Well, no,
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.880]   "you have to include all the green bars."
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:24.240]   But what are the green bars?
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.760]   Those are private assets.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.960]   And Balaji pointed out that,
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.560]   "No, actually, you're proving my point."
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.400]   Because people like you just see
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   all of the private assets of citizens of the United States
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.400]   as belonging to the government.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.520]   And if you actually extend the red bars
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.720]   to the present value of all the long-term liabilities
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.000]   that this government has,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.160]   it's more like $175 billion.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:52.640]   So people like this see the $160 trillion
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.960]   of private wealth as being on the balance sheet
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.440]   of the federal government
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.240]   and being used to offset the $175 trillion of liabilities.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.240]   In other words, all it takes is all you got.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.760]   That's the trajectory we're on.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.420]   - Is we have a-
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.520]   - Yeah, your 401k is the government's,
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.360]   and we're gonna seize it.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.440]   - They're gonna absolutely go
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.120]   after your retirement accounts,
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.080]   because that's the only way
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.600]   they're gonna pay off these liabilities.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.440]   - It's gross.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.280]   - Unless you wanna stop it now.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.200]   - Yeah, 'cause another idea, cut spending.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.040]   Cut spending, yeah.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.120]   - Well, there's another great tweet
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.680]   by a guy who said, "Laptop mercenary."
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.640]   I don't know this account,
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.400]   but he said something funny.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.120]   He said, "Imagine being a California high earner,
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.320]   "options, either vote for your own financial liquidation
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.400]   "or vote for the orange man."
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.240]   - Yeah, it's brutal.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.800]   - Checkmate, dude, checkmate.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.720]   You guys just gotta put on the red MAGA hat.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.280]   It's happening.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.280]   - Here's a, I mean, I read that you're all in, so to speak.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   - You don't have to wear the red MAGA hat.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.960]   When you go into that polling booth,
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.880]   nobody knows the button you're pushing.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.920]   - Yeah, okay, there it is.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.320]   I mean, these are the two worst candidates in the history.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.080]   - Jason, Biden has had four years
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.840]   to prove that he's a moderate.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.320]   He's had four years to prove that he represents
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.960]   the normalcy that he promised to us
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.640]   when he first got elected.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:13.760]   That's been refuted.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.320]   I mean, how much more does it take for you to understand
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.440]   that his policy is radical?
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.280]   - Yeah, I mean.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.880]   - He combines the foreign policy of Dick Cheney
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.600]   with the economic policy of Elizabeth Warren.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.960]   How much more does it take?
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.680]   Are you gonna vote for your own financial liquidation?
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.520]   Because that's what we're talking about.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.800]   - It's the worst two candidates,
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.160]   and I think I'm voting for the third.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.400]   - Ooh, an RFK endorsement.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.320]   Wow, I didn't see that.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.920]   - I think I just have to put in the protest vote of RFK.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.320]   - I love RFK, I think he's a great vote.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:44.800]   - Yeah.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.760]   - For Democrats.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.080]   - I mean, crazy.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.840]   I think maybe I go after the rock.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.920]   But yeah, congratulations on Biden
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.360]   on making this easy for Trump
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.040]   with his build back broke plan.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:57.600]   So dumb.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.440]   All right, everybody, this is the World's Greatest Podcast.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.280]   By the way, Jason, if you do decide
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.720]   in the end to vote for Biden,
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.960]   I'll send you some luxury tents
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.400]   that you and your kids could sleep in.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.520]   You can tell them stories about how you voted for him.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.360]   - It's so brutal.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.560]   I mean, the worst two candidates of our lifetime.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.800]   - J. Cal, here are your choices, okay?
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.840]   You can vote for Trump,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.480]   or you can give up the ski lodge.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.720]   What's it gonna be?
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.480]   - I mean, at this point, I think I'm RFK all the way.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.680]   I think I got to go for,
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.120]   just try to support independence.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.040]   I just think we got to balance the budget.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.160]   Shout out David Friedberg.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.280]   For the rain man himself, David Sachs.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.800]   Yeah, David Friedberg, the sultan of science.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.080]   We didn't get to science corner this week.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.920]   We're gonna start with it next week.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:49.760]   And the chairman dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.120]   I am the world's greatest moderator
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.320]   of the number one podcast in the world.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.120]   I'm manifesting.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.160]   Can we get to Spielberg?
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.680]   I'm manifesting tracking here.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.120]   And take us out Spielberg.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.720]   Young Spielberg, baby, coming at you.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.040]   - Love your voice, bye-bye.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:05.760]   - Love you besties.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.040]   - Welcome everybody to episode 175.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:09.520]   - That's right.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.960]   It's episode 177 of your favorite podcast.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.560]   And the largest and most listened to podcast in the world.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.840]   Officially, episode 177 of the podcast starts right now.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:26.000]   - Is that the largest most listened to podcast in the world?
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:26.960]   - I'm manifesting.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:39.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:59.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:09.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:29.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:39.200]   (upbeat music)
