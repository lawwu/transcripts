[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   I have noticed a lot of crypto people get into Georgism, not the least of which is Vitalik
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.480]   Buterin who endorsed my book, who's a huge fan of Georgism.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.880]   I'll take fans from anywhere, even from people I've had sparring contests with.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.200]   I'm generally pretty skeptical that crypto can fulfill all its promises.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.880]   I am excited by those promises, and if they can prove me wrong, that would be great.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.640]   And I think there's some logic to what you're saying is that if we literally couldn't track
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.080]   transactions, then I guess we don't have much to tax except land.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.160]   I don't think that'll actually come to pass just based off of recent events.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.400]   And that's basically my position on it.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.400]   But I have noticed a lot of crypto people, just they're some of the easiest people to
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   convince about Georgism, which was completely surprising to me.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.880]   But I've learned a lot by talking to them.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.440]   It's very interesting and weird.
