[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860]   How vulnerable is a whole AI ecosystem to something that might happen in Taiwan?
[00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.800]   So let's say there's like a tsunami in Taiwan or something.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.940]   What happens to AI in general?
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.920]   Like it's def it's definitely going to be a significant setback.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.960]   It's not going to, it might be something equivalent to no one will be able to get
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   more computers for a few years, but I expect computers will spring up.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.520]   Like, for example, I believe that Intel has fags just of the
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.080]   previous generation, a few generations ago.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.660]   So that means that if Intel wanted to, they could produce
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.720]   something GPU like, from four years ago.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.720]   So yeah, it's not the best, let's say.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320]   I'm actually not sure about if my statement about Intel is correct, but I
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.040]   do know that there are fags outside of Taiwan that is not as good, but you can
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.840]   still use them and still go very far with them.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.640]   It's just, it just costs, it's just a setback.
