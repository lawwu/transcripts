[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   In the following sermon which was given on Sunday morning the 5th of July 1959
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480]   in the Westminster Chapel, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the text
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.320]   to be found in Isaiah chapter 63 verses 15 to 19.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.700]   Look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.280]   thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:39.080]   of thy mercies toward me are they restrained doubtless thou art our father
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.640]   though Abram be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledge us not thou O Lord
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.900]   art our father our Redeemer thy name is from everlasting O Lord why hast thou
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.340]   made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear return
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.380]   for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance the people of thy
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.840]   holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.400]   thy sanctuary we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   called by thy name now in our study of this great prayer of the Prophet Isaiah
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.040]   which is recorded in this chapter and in the following chapter chapter 64 we come
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.760]   to a particularly interesting point you remember that in chapter 62 we have seen
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.320]   the Prophet confronting the desolate and forsaken condition of the nation of the
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.800]   church at that time we see him recognizing the situation and
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.360]   determining and deciding to do two things one was to set watchmen upon the
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.560]   walls and the other was to pray he exhorts his fellow countrymen not to
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.840]   give God any rest and not to give themselves any rest whatsoever until
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.360]   Jerusalem shall be made again a praise in the earth and then having given the
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.640]   exhortation he proceeds in this 63rd chapter to the prayer you remember that
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.600]   before he did so God gave him a vision in order to encourage him and God still
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.560]   does that with his people who truly are seeking his face he gives us
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.700]   encouragement and then in the light of this encouragement the Prophet begins to
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.240]   pray and we were considering last Sunday morning the first part of his prayer
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.560]   which begins in verse 7 I will make mention of the loving-kindnesses of the
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.520]   Lord there we watched him and his method is most important his method you
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.080]   remember was this having started with a reminder of the character of God he then
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.160]   reviews the history of his own people it's a very wise thing to do that a very
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.320]   comforting thing our danger today is to think perhaps that the church has never
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   been like this before and to feel therefore that Christianity is in a
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.240]   hopeless state and condition and that we are witnessing the end of the Christian
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.680]   Church now the antidote to that is to go back into history and the moment you do
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.240]   so you will find that the church has often been in this state before even as
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.560]   Israel had often been in that kind of condition before so he goes back over it
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.160]   all and what he found you remember was this that whenever Israel was in trouble
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.440]   it was always due to our own folly our own rebellion it was always due to the
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.640]   fact that they had turned against God but they rebelled and vexed his Holy
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.040]   Spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.280]   now that's an invariable rule it isn't the people who are outside who caused
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   the trouble it is we ourselves well he saw that this was always the case in the
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.080]   past and he saw further that when the children of Israel realized that and
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.200]   repented and turned back to God and began crying out and saying where is he
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.240]   where is he that God had pity and had mercy upon them looked down upon them
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   again and began to bless them once more very well fortified with all that
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   knowledge the Prophet now proceeds with his prayer and what does he do well he
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   realizes obviously that the only thing to do is to repeat what had always been
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.400]   done by the children of Israel at such times and what we have this morning to
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.440]   consider is the beginning of this prayer of the Prophet and of the nation as
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   realizing that they are where they are because of their own folly and rebellion
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.440]   they turn back to God in penitence and in conclusion now the prayer begins here
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:38.000]   really at this 15th verse and it goes on right to the end of chapter 64 there
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.760]   this morning however we can only consider the first section which is to
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:51.280]   be found here in these verses at the end of chapter 63 now as we come to look at
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.920]   this prayer and realize that this is the only hope for us at this present hour
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.440]   because our position our predicament is almost precisely like that of the
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   children of Israel when they'd been carried away captive to Babylon and as
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.960]   they say the church has often been in subsequent periods as we realize all
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.320]   that we must realize that this is our only hope we must pray this kind of
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:30.240]   prayer very well what are first of all the general characteristics of the
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:38.160]   prayer before we come to look at the particular petitions it is essential
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.080]   that we should be clear about the mode or the method or what I'm describing is
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.520]   the general characteristics of the prayer and they are quite obvious on the
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:59.480]   surface of the prayer here's the first the urgency the importunity there's
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.360]   nothing half-hearted about this prayer nothing slack or vague no the men's
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.760]   whole soul is moved to its very depths and he's urgent because he realizes the
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.040]   position here are God's people with their city sacked and ruined they have
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.680]   desecrated the sanctuary he gives his description and then he pleads with God
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.240]   the matters urgent well I mustn't stay with this this morning I've had occasion
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.960]   to refer to it before and I shall have occasion to do so again next will he go
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.400]   to God willing next Sunday but this note I say must never be forgotten by us and
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.040]   of course we can only remember it as we do realize something of the urgent
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.880]   condition in which we find ourselves to me it is astonishing that as God's
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.680]   people we can be so much at ease in Zion when we see the state of the church and
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:05.040]   the state of the world round and about us I'm not only thinking of armaments
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.760]   and bombs I'm thinking of industrial unrest and the selfishness that is so
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.400]   obvious in every walk of life and in every rank of society lawlessness
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.560]   self-seeking there is only one hope for this kind of thing and there it is that
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.640]   men and women begin to realize again who and what they are and their subservience
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:40.080]   to God we all need to be a humble before God there a final disaster overtakes us
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   and it is only I say as we realize the position that we shall begin to pray
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.960]   with the urgency and the importunity that characterizes the prayer of the
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:56.600]   Prophet and then notice his strong emotion you notice the strong emotion in
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:03.760]   the very way in which the men pray there is a kind of form to his prayer and yet
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.720]   there's a sense in which it isn't hasn't a form it's formless there's an
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.880]   alternation here between confession and pleading and that's always a sign of
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:23.240]   strong emotion a man who's experiencing a strong emotion is not over punctilious
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.640]   about form and about diction and arrangement no no he's so moved that he
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.520]   doesn't take time to think orderly in a sense but he just utters the controlling
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.880]   feeling at the moment and that's what we have in this prayer he doesn't first of
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.080]   all gather his petitions and pleas together and then give his reasons and
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.440]   so on no no the man's heart is so profoundly moved is in the grip of a
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   strong emotion and therefore he prays from the depth of his heart and you know
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:05.640]   my friends whenever the church is in a state of revival you get the same thing
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.720]   whenever the Spirit of God comes down upon the church forms are forgotten
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.280]   liturgies are put into a balance and the Spirit of God moves in men's hearts and
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.920]   out of the heart come their expressions of worship their pleas and their
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.160]   petitions exactly as you've got here and in every other great prayer in the Bible
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.920]   and then the next element I must just notice is this one the element of
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:43.720]   pleading the element of reasoning with God indeed I can use a stronger term the
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:51.640]   very element of wrestling with God have you noticed it here the way in which he
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:11:01.880]   plies his arguments he says oh Lord thou Lord at our father oh Lord why hast thou
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:10.280]   made us to err from thy ways and so on and not only that you notice here an
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   element of boldness there is almost an element of daring here and we've seen in
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.600]   considering the prayer of Moses in Exodus 33 exactly the same thing you'll
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:33.040]   always find this in every great prayer of intercession the prayer he pleads
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.160]   with God he reasons with God listen to this man doing it he says why hast thou
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.920]   made us to err the people of thy holiness have possessed the land for but
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.120]   a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary we are thine
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.360]   thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name he's
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:56.840]   arguing his reasoning he's pleading with God he's wrestling with God this is a
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   very wonderful element of all true intercession there is a paradoxical
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.320]   element about this the Prophet is very conscious of his unworthiness and the
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.880]   unworthiness of the people and yet you see in spite of that he's aware of
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.920]   something that makes him feel that he's got a right to plead with God and reason
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.520]   and argue and as it were wrestle with God and to say I will not let thee go
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:35.240]   oh Lord you can't refuse us now that is it seems to me the real key to the
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   understanding of this particular prayer and therefore I would put it in the form
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.280]   of a principle you see there is an apparent problem for us here here is a
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.360]   man pleading for a nation that had rebelled and that sinned against God and
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:00.160]   which God had punished he is deeply aware of this sinfulness and the shame
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   of it all and yet I say he prays with this holy boldness what is the secret
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   well the secret is this he is aware of a certain relationship to God which in
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.000]   spite of all the unworthiness makes him feel that he has a right to go into the
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.720]   presence of God and reason and argue and plead with passion he wrestles with God
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.880]   now then the principle involved is this you see that in the last analysis our
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.640]   only hope is our understanding of the doctrine the truth of our relationship
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:51.720]   to God great prayer is always the outcome of great understanding deep
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:59.920]   prayer is always based upon a grasp of the truth you can get a very
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.520]   superficial and a glib kind of praying that may at first sight sound very
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.040]   wonderful but you wait until trial comes and he doesn't know where it is the glib
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.920]   phrases seem rather empty they die upon the lips when a man is in the furnace of
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.160]   affliction oh it is then I say that he falls back upon certain fundamental
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:26.520]   truths of which he is absolutely sure and certain the key to great pray is a
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:33.880]   deep knowledge and grasp of the doctrines of grace now I'm not simply
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.880]   asserting that the Bible's full of it and if you read the story of the church
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.040]   throughout the running centuries you'll find it exemplified time and time again
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:49.400]   the men who can stand in the furnace of affliction are the men who have got a
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:55.480]   rock beneath their feet and the rock is the Holy Scripture and its blessed
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   doctrines now then let us see all this working out in practice there are the
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.680]   great characteristics of this man's prayer well now what are his actual
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:13.800]   petitions this morning we can only look at the first great petition and the
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:20.920]   first great petition of course is in these pregnant words look down behold
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.800]   here it is in verse 15 look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.840]   thy holiness and of thy glory look down next Sunday we shall go on God willing
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.520]   to the second petition and the second petition is this oh that there would
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:44.880]   have come down but he hasn't got to that yet he's asking God now to look down now
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:52.800]   here of course is the first thing which we you and I have to realize here is the
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:01.520]   first great need Israel is defeated the great bulk of the people are carried
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:08.640]   away and their captives and the slaves in Babylon the temple lies in ruins the
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   great city of David the great city of God it lies a heap of rubble what's the
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:22.920]   matter how has this ever come to pass what's gone wrong what's the supreme
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.960]   need I don't keep you this morning in translating all that into modern
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.160]   language but that is the picture of the modern church let's be no mistake about
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.140]   that the Church of God is down she's in a sense of ruins and there's the enemy
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:46.480]   triumphant and laughing at us what's the matter what is the supreme need well
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.600]   there's no doubt about it according to this man and it's the same in the Psalms
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.040]   that we read at the beginning it's the same everywhere in these great prayers
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.200]   in the Bible what is the need well the need is the presence of God the face of
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   God God seems to have turned his back upon us he is not looking upon us he is
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.920]   turning away I don't hesitate to use these terms the term father is used in
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   my text this morning and God is our father yes and God treats us his
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.680]   children as we treat our children the little child has been doing something
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.280]   that he shouldn't do and then he comes to you and what you do you don't look at
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.080]   him you turn away from him he holds on to you and he just wants you to look at
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.120]   him the thing he can't bear is that you're not looking at him and he pulls
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.960]   at you and he pleads with you just to look upon him he wants to see your face
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.040]   and that's exactly what this what this prophet is doing here in his prayer look
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.920]   down he said look at us Oh God why do you turn your face away why do you avert
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.040]   your face why is your back turned toward us why are you like a traveler a
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:08.280]   stranger going away from us look down it is a cry and a plea for the face of God
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:19.040]   and the smile of God my dear friends the test of your spirituality and mine is
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.560]   whether we know anything about offering that petition or not you know just to go
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.000]   down on your knees and to recite the Lord's Prayer and to ask blessing upon
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.520]   yourself and your family and the things you're going to do that day that's not
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.720]   praying oh well let me not be too hard all right I'll grant that it is a sort
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.600]   of prayer but it's a very small it's a very primitive kind of praying it's the
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:53.320]   prayer of a tyrant you know what really tests us is this that we long to see the
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.680]   smile of God to know that God is looking upon us and that we are living and
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:10.200]   moving under his eye that his eye is upon us God of mercy God of grace show
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:16.680]   the brightness of thy face that was what was troubling the prophet you see God
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:23.300]   had averted his face Oh Lord he says look down upon us well now I say that this is
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:33.040]   still the position and this is the supreme need of the church today are we
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.680]   sufficiently sensitive I wonder to the presence of God do we know the
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:47.080]   difference between God smiling upon us and God not smiling upon us it's the
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   test of a preacher there is all the difference in the world to be preaching
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.200]   merely from human understanding and energy and preaching in the conscious
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.560]   smile of God I can't describe the difference to you there's an eternity of
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.440]   difference between the two things there is nothing more terrible that I know of
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:19.280]   than to be in this pulpit alone myself without the conscious smile of God look
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:26.480]   down do you know his smile and do you therefore know what it is to be bereft
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:33.840]   of it and like the little child to plead with him to turn round and just to look
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.560]   at you again God seems to be turning away from the church he seems to have
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.880]   lost his interest in us now that's the beginning of the prayer but let's go on
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:50.860]   and follow him and see how exactly and in practice he pleads with God to look
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:59.440]   down again and to smile upon them once more here are the rules this is
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:06.480]   invariable there's no other way the first is he starts by worshipping God
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:19.280]   and adoring God listen to it look down he says well where from from heaven and
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:30.840]   behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory we've got to
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.600]   start there you see we don't start with ourselves we never must start with
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.520]   ourselves we must always start with God and when you start with God there are
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.800]   certain things you've got to realize about God if you don't you might as well
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.860]   not get on your knees you might as well not begin to pray who are we going to
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:58.800]   pray to who are we addressing well we are addressing one who lives in heaven
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:08.440]   look down from heaven you know we are so self-important and so self-concerned and
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.600]   we rush into the presence of God our knees my personal need and the need of
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.080]   the church and we go as if stop my friend I don't care what your
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.880]   predicament is I don't care if hell is yawning beneath you I don't care if all
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.080]   your enemies are gathered against you I don't care what's true of you if you're
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:31.560]   going to pray to God realize who God is and where he is look down from him well
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.400]   you see we've got it all but we don't realize it we are so familiar with the
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.440]   Lord's Prayer that we don't pray it our father said our Lord which art in heaven
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:55.960]   God is in heaven and we are upon the earth our father which art in heaven yes
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.880]   it's a good thing to remember that if it were only this that as you and I are
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.200]   surrounded by perplexities and are wondering what's going to happen and are
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.360]   so conscious of the strength of communism or every other ism that we
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.400]   begin to quake and fear remember that he's above it all and looks down upon it
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.480]   all he's not in it he's outside the flux of it all and that'll put you right at
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:29.080]   once look down from heaven and behold from where well the habitation of thy
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:36.560]   holiness quite right says our Lord this is how you're to pray our father which
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:46.200]   art in heaven hallowed be thy name hallowed holy same thing you see this is
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   invariable my friends do we remember who God is when we pray do we tell him do we
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.980]   use this terminology do we think it out do we remember the holiness of God how
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:03.480]   essential it is look at our Lord himself when he was here in this world he who
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.680]   though he was on earth was still in heaven the only begotten beloved son of
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:18.120]   the father look at him praying and this is what he says holy father we don't
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.760]   pray truly unless we realize these things we are like spoiled children and
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.320]   we want forgiveness we want blessings and we rush to God but wait a minute
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.840]   you're approaching a holy father and then as you remember that you'll
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.440]   remember your own sin your own unworthiness you'll forget your rights
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.720]   you'll forget your demands and you'll just prostrate yourself before him from
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:53.600]   the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory what is the glory of God well
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:25:04.760]   no men can define it the glory of God is his essential and ultimate attribute it
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:19.040]   means his greatness his splendor his majesty I'm never tired of saying this I
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.040]   must say it again you know the real trouble with all of us is that we don't
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   know God we think we do but we don't the glory of God have you ever thought of it
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.360]   you see the Psalmist knew this much about it he said I would sooner be a
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.760]   doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness or
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.840]   of the ungodly he'd sooner be a man in the vestibule giving out the hymns doing
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.040]   the most menial task perhaps than to be in the very parlor in the innermost
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.400]   citadel in the very center of the life of the ungodly why well he tells you why
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:12.080]   grace and glory to see the glory of God in the tabernacle just to peep through
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.160]   the door now and again and to see something of the Shekinah glory of God
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:28.680]   from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory in other words it is still
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:36.880]   you see a prayer for a glimpse of the glory of God of the face of God to see
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.600]   God look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.200]   of thy glory he starts with it then he goes on to this he reminds God and
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:57.600]   himself of the relationship that subsists between them you see you start
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.520]   with God as he is in himself and then you go on to the relationship between us
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:12.320]   and God well he here are his terms he puts it in the form of a question he
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:23.160]   says where is thy zeal toward me where is thy zeal toward me what's he talking
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.400]   about well what he means is this he knows the past history of the children
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.080]   of Israel and of God's dealings with them he knows what God has said about
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   them and he knows what God did for them and what he finds is this but God in the
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.760]   past had been zealous on the behalf of his people there you see with the
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.880]   children of Israel long ago in the captivity of Egypt and the taskmasters
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.400]   were flaying their backs with the whips making them produce more bricks with
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.280]   less straw they were in a terrible state and condition and God arose in his zeal
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.080]   for them and he called Moses and he said go back I want you to lead those people
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.280]   out but Moses said what can I do with Pharaoh don't worry sir I'll be with you
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.200]   the zeal of God read the story how God intervened and acted and did things and
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:18.440]   brought them out the zeal of God for his people where is that zeal now says the
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.600]   Prophet that's how you used to be but what where is thy zeal we wouldn't be
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   defeated if thou were still zealous for us and for our cause where is this
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.320]   energy that thou once did display on our behalf you said we were the apple of your
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:40.560]   eye and that you'd allow nothing to harm us where is thy zeal that's the prayer
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.640]   he is reminding God of his ancient relationship to the nation and to the
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:51.440]   people and his zeal on their behalf and then he adds another term not only where
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:29:00.040]   is thy zeal but where is thy strength toward me and this is very wonderful
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:08.720]   God's almighty strength and ability and power I rather like the way in which the
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.640]   psalmist puts it the Prophet puts it here you see he doesn't doubt the
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:21.800]   strength he knows it's there he is confronted by the power of Babylon and
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.320]   the Chaldeans who have sacked the city of Jerusalem carried away the people
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.200]   captive and you might come to the conclusion well of course this has
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.560]   happened to us because God hadn't the strength to prevent it and wasn't strong
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:39.120]   enough to conquer them no no says the Prophet it isn't that God has still got
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.960]   the same strength he is the father of lights with whom is no change of
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.800]   changeableness neither shadow of turning oh yes he's got the strength but the
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:58.560]   question is where is it it's there but he's not exercising it toward us and if
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.760]   we are not clear about this we must be feeling rather hopeless this morning you
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.880]   say why is the church as she is why is God's cause down why is the enemy
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.600]   rampant and powerful and triumphing is it because God can't stop them no no the
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.720]   strength is there that let's ask him where is it why isn't he showing it with
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:27.040]   respect to us where is thy strength and then this most extraordinary term where
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:37.440]   is the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies that's of course a typical
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.640]   biblical and especially Old Testament expression the sounding of the bowels
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:48.120]   the ancients believed that the bowels were the seats of the emotions why well
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.600]   because when a man's under a strong emotion he's aware of the movement of
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   his bowels he may even have a pain a colic and agony strong emotion gives
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.880]   movements of the bowels and that's what this man says where is the sounding of
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:10.560]   thy bowels and of thy mercies toward us you remember Jeremiah crying out in his
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.360]   pain my bowels my bowels he was in agony because of the state of his people and
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.480]   that is where he felt it that's where he related it and the prophet you see
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.000]   venturing daring applies it all to God he says why aren't you being moved to
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.640]   others as of old why is not your emotion to others as it once was the movement
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.120]   the disturbance the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies with respect
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:48.000]   to us where is this why are we not knowing it and experiencing it well that
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.680]   is the second thing that he says and then he comes on to the third which is
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:01.880]   the actual plea that he offers and you notice that it is a threefold plea the
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:10.080]   first I've already been expounding in a sense in the words where is he is well
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.920]   aware that these are still there that God hasn't changed because God cannot
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:26.920]   change he knows that God is as he always has been but he's concerned about the
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.720]   manifestation of all this in other words he's acknowledging and confessing his
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:39.240]   sin and that of the nation how can a holy and a glorious God ever look upon
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:45.640]   us how can he feel compassion and pity and mercy with respect to us we've
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.920]   forfeited it all how can such a holy God ever have another interest in us Oh Lord
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.480]   he says there's nothing to do I plead I just ask for mercy and for compassion
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:06.120]   look down he says behold and then in verse 17 return for thy servant's sake
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.280]   Oh God he says come back to us why are they like a stranger why are they like a
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:19.000]   journeyman why not come back to us return Oh Holy Dove return sweet
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.920]   messenger of rest as Cowper puts it that's his second plea having
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:33.720]   acknowledged that they have no right to ask it he pleads urges God to look again
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.040]   and to exercise his compassions and his tender mercy and his strength and then
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:47.120]   thirdly the most extraordinary petition of all listen to this verse 17 Oh Lord
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:04.120]   fear have you pondered that have you considered it do you realize exactly
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.200]   what this man is saying let's be clear about this his petition is why hast thou
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:16.520]   made us to err from thy ways and why hast thou hardened our heart from thy
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:25.120]   fear what is this well we mustn't evade this difficulty we must face it with open
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.040]   eyes some people have tried to avoid the problem by saying that it just means that
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.960]   God permits us to be hardened that it's God as it were just allowing us to err
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:43.920]   from his ways that isn't what the Prophet said the Prophet says that God
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:51.640]   had actually caused this caused them to err caused their hearts to be hardened
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.680]   he's already said it in chapter 6 in verses 9 and 10 he says to the Prophet go
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.280]   and tell this people here ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.120]   perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:15.080]   shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:20.760]   understand with their heart and convert and be healed God commands the Prophet
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:26.920]   to do that and of course when you come to the New Testament you will find that
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:33.480]   our Lord himself quotes these very words in the gospel according to St. John in
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:42.720]   chapter 12 and in verses 37 to 41 listen to this but though he had done so many
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.960]   miracles before them yet they believed not on him that the saying of Esaias the
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.040]   Prophet might be fulfilled which he spake Lord who hath believed our report
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.920]   and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed therefore they could not
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.560]   believe because that Esaias said again he hath blinded their eyes and hardened
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.480]   their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:18.080]   their heart and be converted and I should heal them these things said Esaias
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:28.040]   when he saw his glory and spake of him and you will find exactly the same thing
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.280]   taught in the last chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles what's it
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.320]   mean it means what the Apostle Paul says in Romans 9 18 therefore hath he mercy
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:49.920]   upon whom he will of mercy and whom he will he hardness what is all this to do
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.120]   with us as someone well here is the answer
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:04.320]   it is a terrible and a dangerous thing for God's people to be disobedient for
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:12.440]   sometimes God punishes our disobedience by not only turning his face from us and
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:21.080]   leaving us to ourselves he even seems to drive us into sin and into error and to
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:30.200]   harden our hearts he sends afflictions and afflictions hardness that is one of
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   God's ways of punishing us and what the prophet is praying is this Oh God stop
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.440]   dealing with us judicially we deserve it we deserve it we've sinned against you
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.920]   we've rebelled against you we said we could go on without you and you've let
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.120]   us go on without you and you've even hardened our hearts you've made us
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:56.760]   obdurate God have mercy he seems to say stop dealing with us judicially be
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.840]   careful how you treat God my friend you may say to yourself I can sin against
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.680]   God and then of course I can repent and go back and find God whenever I want you
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:13.880]   try it you try it and you will sometimes find that not only can you not find God
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:20.720]   but that you don't even want to you'll be aware of a terrible hardness callousness
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.440]   a callosity in your heart and you can do nothing about it and then you suddenly
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.680]   realize that it's God punishing you to reveal your sinfulness and your vileness
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.600]   to you and there's only one thing to do and you turn back to him and say oh God
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.840]   don't go on dealing with me judicially though I deserve it
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:45.080]   soften my heart melt me I can't do it myself you cast yourself utterly upon
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:50.440]   his mercy and upon his compassion that is the third great plea that God should
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:58.880]   cease to cause them to err and to harden their hearts judicially and that brings
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.200]   me to the last matter I must refer to this morning we've seen his method his
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.960]   worship his adoration we've listened to his threefold plea and now he brings his
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.560]   arguments the grounds on which he ventures to make his plea and oh how
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:23.480]   interesting they are he doesn't plead anything in themselves no merit in
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:29.520]   themselves at all of course not there is none we deserve nothing from God if you
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.200]   think you do well my dear friends you don't know him you haven't seen that
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.440]   glory you know nothing about that holiness and you haven't seen the plague
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:46.320]   of your own heart no no there's nothing here but just to say oh Lord is there an
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   O in you are praying that's another very good test of prayer that this O comes in
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:01.720]   Oh Lord or are you such good people and doing such excellent work as
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.680]   evangelicals busy with this organization and all you do is to ask God to
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:12.080]   bless you and to keep on or do you know what it is to say Oh Lord that's how the
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:19.960]   Prophet prayed that's how the men of God have always prayed this O somebody once
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.600]   said you know that a sign the best sign of a coming revival is that the word O
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   begins to enter into the prayers of the people Oh Lord well very well what are
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.680]   the grounds well here they are he pleads the covenant relationship doubtless he
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:45.240]   says thou art our father thou art our father this is most significant you know
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.560]   the trouble with these Jews always was that they were always talking about
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.920]   Abram Abram is our father they said these Gentiles who are they Abraham is
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.800]   our father they rested upon the fact that they were the children of Abram John
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.480]   the Baptist knew that very well because you remember when he preached to them he
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.080]   says begin not to say in yourselves we be Abraham seed for I say unto you that
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:18.000]   God is able to raise of these stones children unto Abraham and you and I must
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.920]   not go into the presence of God merely in the name of tradition merely in the
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.960]   name of the fathers merely in the name of those who've gone before us I don't
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.000]   care who they are whether they were the Methodist father or the Puritans or the
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.800]   Reformers no no we don't plead their name Abraham Jacob not at all
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:44.760]   thou art our father the Reformers can save us the Puritans can save us the
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:51.320]   Methodist fathers can save us and there is a grave danger that we fall back upon
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:42:00.040]   the fathers no no it's God thou art our father and nobody else and how right he
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:09.400]   is it is God who has made the covenant it is God who owns us and we are his
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:17.760]   people God is the founder of Israel through Abram through Jacob yes but they
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:26.440]   are not the fathers it's God and listen to another contrast which he draws though
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:32.520]   Abram be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledges not thou O Lord art our
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.400]   father our Redeemer thy name is from everlasting
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.760]   Abram of course a great man thank God Jacob marvelous yes yes but Abram is
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:50.560]   dead and Jacob is dead they can't rise up and save us God thy name is from
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:58.880]   everlasting it is to everlasting God is not the God of the dead but of the
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:07.080]   living and he is the living God we don't fall back on the fathers however august
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:14.960]   and great we go back to God not only that I believe he was saying something
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:25.640]   like this though Abram be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledges not by which I
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.960]   think he meant this he's saying you know I believe if Abram and Jacob could come
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.560]   back and see us they wouldn't recognize us they wouldn't acknowledge us they'd
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.320]   say those people don't belong to me they're not my offspring I renounce
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:43.280]   them Abram was the friend of God and a holy man so was Jacob and they wouldn't
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.480]   recognize us they disavow us they disinherit us thank God says the Prophet
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:56.280]   that thou art our father though thou art a holy God in glory you've got more love
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.960]   and compassion than Abram or Jacob ever had the two of them together and
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.800]   multiplied by infinity thou art our father they would probably repudiate us
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.840]   with thee there is mercy that thou mayest be feared thank God we're in the
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:18.240]   hands of God after all and not of men though Abram be ignorant of us and
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:26.720]   Israel acknowledges not thou O Lord art still our father our Redeemer thy name
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.160]   is from everlasting and then he goes on to say you see we are thine inheritance
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:38.600]   he says this is the truth the tribes of thine inheritance that's who we are we
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.800]   are thine people they were not thy people we are thine thou never barest
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:50.040]   rule over them they were not called by thy name this is a tremendous thing the
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:56.400]   Lord's portion is his people though we may be full of sin and unworthiness as
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.040]   we are we are still the people of his holiness let's go to him remembering
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:06.520]   that reminding him of it bad as we are we are still his we are not in the world
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:13.280]   and the world doesn't belong to him plead that with God ask him to return we
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:20.600]   are thine the people of thy holiness the Lord's portion is his people and then
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:28.400]   his final argument that God has no relationship to these other people here
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:35.360]   they are you see the Chaldeans in the time of the Prophet the Egyptians at an
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.800]   earlier period anybody looking on might have thought that the Egyptians were the
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.600]   people of God that the Chaldeans were the people of God they seem to be
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.200]   blessed and were affluent and full of prosperity and these others slaves
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   serfs Oh God says the Prophet can you go on doing this can you go on behaving in
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.120]   such a way as to give the impression that they are thy people but they're not
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.160]   thy people the people of thy holiness have possessed the land but a little
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.840]   while we're taken out of it and the Chaldeans are possessing it but it isn't
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:18.280]   theirs our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary we are thine thou never
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:26.040]   barest rule over them they were not called by thy name and that must be your
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:33.600]   prayer and mine the godless world today stands out in its brightness and its
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:39.000]   glory and its fatness as the 73rd Psalm puts it there I stand out in fatness
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.640]   there are no bands in their death they seem to be having everything and God's
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:49.080]   people a little handful suffering and troubles and problems and the world
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:57.440]   laughs and says where is their God and you and I should turn that into a prayer
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.120]   and with humility and yet with confidence and boldness we should go to
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:12.000]   God and say oh Lord can you let this go on they're not your people these people
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.640]   whom you're allowing to have so much prosperity they're blasphemers they're
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.440]   thine adversaries as well as ours Oh God can you go on doing that though we are
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.920]   weak and feeble though we are down though we're rebellious though we are
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:33.640]   sinful though we have nothing to recommend us even still we are thy people
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:45.320]   God have mercy upon us thou art our father look upon us behold us smile upon
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:51.640]   us acknowledge us turn back to us or don't keep turning away come back return
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:48:06.200]   Oh Holy Dove return sweet messenger of rest we are thine still they are not
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:19.800]   return to us arise for our deliverance have mercy upon us God grant us to pray
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:27.400]   as the Prophet prayed we do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of
