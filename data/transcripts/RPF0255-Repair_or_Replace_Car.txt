[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   Are you experienced?
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.000]   Sure, you've been to Las Vegas,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   but have you truly experienced Las Vegas?
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.640]   The Fremont Street Experience is the OG Las Vegas,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.980]   featuring 100 amazing bars and restaurants,
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.240]   incredible people watching,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.840]   and the signature Downtown Rocks concert series,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.620]   featuring free live music from top acts.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.380]   And you have to check out Slotzilla,
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.220]   the world's ultimate zip line.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.380]   Do Vegas right.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.080]   Check out the Fremont Street Experience
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920]   and purchase your tickets to Slotzilla,

[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.200]   If you've ever been faced with a major car repair,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.900]   or even worse, a bunch of ongoing car repairs,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.100]   and sat there and said to yourself,
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.340]   man, I am just wasting all of my money on this thing.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.300]   Maybe I should go get a new car.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.940]   Well, I've been there, and a lot of people are there,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.440]   and it's not easy to know what to do in that situation.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580]   So today, I'm gonna share with you some thoughts
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.380]   about how I would answer the question
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.380]   of when to decide whether to fix your car or replace it.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:21.340]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.900]   Thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140]   Today, we're gonna talk about cars.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.300]   Probably the ultimate whipping post
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.980]   of the personal finance industry.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.140]   We love to get mad about them
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.240]   and talk about how much money we spend on them,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.420]   but they're kind of important.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420]   And I'll tell you, I've struggled with this decision,
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.980]   struggled to figure out how to give you good advice,
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.500]   so take my advice today, test it,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.300]   and then let me know what you think.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.780]   Specifically today, we're gonna pull apart this question,
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.620]   and this is a question
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.900]   that has always bothered me a little bit.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.060]   I like to have a framework for most decisions.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.940]   If I can ever create one,
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.340]   I really like to have a framework for financial decisions
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.840]   that will give me the opportunity
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   to be able to know what to do in most situations.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.020]   But the question of what to do when your car breaks
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.380]   is not an easy question to answer.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.860]   It's really, really not.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220]   And I've heard various pieces of advice,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.740]   but even on this subject,
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.380]   there's not a continuity of advice.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.020]   Probably, I guess, the only major piece of advice
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.340]   that I have often heard is the idea
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.740]   that if your car gets to the point
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.900]   where the cost of repairing it
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.380]   is gonna be more than half of the value of the car,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.360]   then you should replace it.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.420]   But even there, where does it come from?
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.640]   It's always really, really bothered me.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.100]   So I'm gonna share with you some thoughts
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.940]   about how I approach a situation,
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.660]   and I hope it can be helpful to you.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.820]   Because for many people,
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.060]   having a car that's either broken down
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.420]   or is continually breaking down,
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.420]   that can lead to a major, major financial mistake,
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.140]   where they go out and buy a new car.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.060]   So we're gonna talk in detail about that.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.220]   Before we do, a couple quick announcements.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.140]   Number one, this is episode 255 of the show.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.140]   Episode 254 was an interview with J.D. Roth
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.900]   from Get Rich Slowly.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.140]   And I would recommend to you
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.580]   that you check that out in the feed if you haven't heard it.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.140]   I made a mistake when I was publishing that show,
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.420]   and I set the date wrong.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.860]   So for many of you, it showed up like a week in the past,
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.900]   but I've fixed that.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.560]   So if you are just tuning into this show
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.380]   and you didn't hear or see the episode with J.D. Roth,
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.460]   go back and check that in the feed
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.020]   and download and check that out.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.220]   Also, let's talk about sponsors right up front today,
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.360]   and let's do this quickly today.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.260]   Sponsor of the day number one
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.900]   is Patrick Snow, the publishing doctor.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.180]   Patrick is my personal publishing coach.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.020]   He's been on the show.
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.540]   If you'd like a full introduction to him,
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.220]   go back and listen to episode 252 of the show.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.740]   And there you'll have an hour-long interview
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.180]   where we talk about publishing,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.540]   publishing a book, and why you should consider it.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.960]   The statistics indicate that many, many people,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.800]   at least 80%, about 80% of the population,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.160]   would like to publish a book.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.980]   And in terms of your career and enhancing your career,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.660]   publishing a book can make a huge, huge difference
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.180]   in your overall marketing plan.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.620]   So definitely would recommend that you consider it.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.620]   Patrick is an expert in this area,
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.740]   and he's got a tremendous wealth of resources
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.940]   to guide you through the whole publishing process.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.500]   I have found and am continuing to find his information
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.180]   and content to be extremely valuable for me
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.540]   as I work toward the publishing of my own book.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.340]   So check out his information.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.220]   You can go to his website at thepublishingdoctor.com,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.020]   thepublishingdoctor.com.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.340]   If you are interested in checking with him
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.400]   and getting some information about the publishing process,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.580]   the best way to get in touch with him
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.740]   is shoot him a text message,
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.980]   and he will be glad to offer you
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.980]   a complimentary 30 to 60-minute consultation
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.740]   on the publishing process.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.380]   He can hear a little bit about your story,
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.980]   hear a little bit about what you're doing,
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.100]   and give you some insight and some ideas that would be helpful.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.100]   Best way to schedule that is text him at 206-310-1200.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.020]   206-310-1200, and that info will be in the show notes.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.420]   Sponsor of the day number two is Paladin Registry.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.780]   Paladin Registry is a service that I went out
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.380]   and looked for in an effort to respond to your requests
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.300]   about how to find a good financial advisor.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.260]   And Paladin Registry is a service where they come together
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.180]   and they vet financial advisors.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.020]   A lot of information that you should know about that.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.500]   Please go back, if you haven't heard it,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.260]   and listen to episode 248 of the show.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.320]   That is an hour-long interview
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.540]   with the founder of Paladin Registry, Jack Waymire,
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.500]   and in that show, we talk in detail
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.340]   about the need for a registry service
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.140]   and how they screen advisors, et cetera.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.820]   So start by listening to that show,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.980]   and then go to the Paladin Registry link
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.980]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N,
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.980]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.020]   And if you are interested
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.780]   in potentially interviewing financial advisors,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.540]   put your info in there, and they will do their best
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.580]   to connect you with a few different advisors
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.900]   in your neighborhood that they have screened and vetted.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.480]   And hopefully those will be a good place for you to start
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.500]   as you interview advisors for their ability to serve you.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.620]   So radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.140]   All right, let's talk about cars.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.660]   So many of us are gonna be in this place of decision
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.500]   at some point.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.940]   If you own a car (laughs)
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.320]   and you haven't been there in the past,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.340]   you're gonna be there in the future.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.940]   And I've really, really struggled with that,
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.020]   trying to figure out how do we design a framework
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.180]   for the decision?
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.500]   And I haven't been able to come up with a perfect one,
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.620]   but I do have some thoughts.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.780]   And I'll share with you a story
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.580]   because this really happened to me,
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.980]   what was it, earlier this year.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.580]   And I wound up in the scenario,
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.800]   the Sunday morning I had loaded up my family,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.140]   we were getting ready to leave the house on Sunday morning
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.260]   to go to a church meeting.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.360]   And I go out, start the car, and there's a big squeal,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.100]   and all of a sudden it starts making some weird noise.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.140]   Well, I turn the engine off, I get out of the car,
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.900]   I go up and check and look down,
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.020]   and I can see immediately that the belt had come off,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.580]   and I could see immediately that there was a piece broken.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.760]   Cutting right to the point that matters,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.100]   a few days later, got the car towed to a mechanic.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.100]   I was faced with a $2,500 repair bill.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.960]   And what had happened was a pulley
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.780]   on the side of the engine had broken.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.780]   And the way that the engine is constructed on my vehicle,
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.100]   there's a piece of aluminum,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.160]   and the whole thing had broken off.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.020]   So the whole side of the engine had to be replaced.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.940]   And basically, in order to accomplish that repair,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.580]   you practically had to take the whole engine out of the car.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.560]   So it was extremely labor intensive.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   Called around for different quotes to the dealerships,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.920]   called around to a couple of mechanics,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.040]   and the cheapest I could get through it
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.740]   was with about 2,500 bucks.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.220]   2,500 bucks is a lot of money to be spending
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.660]   when your car is not worth very much money.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.840]   I bought the car a few years ago for about 5,000 bucks.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.300]   And when you're sitting there trying to say,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.900]   "Should I spend 2,500 bucks on repairing a car?"
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.860]   That is a difficult, difficult thing to decide.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.580]   And so I faced this personally.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.380]   Ultimately, I wound up repairing the car.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   But we're gonna talk about that,
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.420]   and I'm gonna walk you through my thought process.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.620]   Because this is the time to think through
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.460]   the questions so that when the situation hits,
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.840]   you'll be better prepared to know what to do.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.620]   The time to think through difficult situations
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.740]   is always in advance.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.940]   It's really tough when you're faced with the emotions.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.020]   Maybe you don't have a lot of money at that time,
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.400]   and then all of a sudden you're in the thick of it.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.340]   Really tough to think things through rationally
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.580]   at that point in time.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.340]   It's easier if you've thought through
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.260]   the difficult situations in advance,
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.760]   so that you're prepared mentally
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.920]   for that difficult situation.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.980]   So, what do you do in that situation?
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.440]   Car's broken down.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.740]   Well, to begin with, remember the concept
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.280]   of zero-based thinking.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   Zero-based thinking means everything
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.440]   that's happened in the past, once your car breaks,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.600]   everything that's happened in the past is irrelevant.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.060]   Those are all sunk costs.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.440]   So if you are in the unfortunate situation
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.560]   where you've made a $1,000 repair on your vehicle,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.640]   and then a month later it breaks again,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.600]   and now you've got another $1,000 repair,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.920]   you've got to ignore the first $1,000,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.480]   because it's gone, it's a sunk cost.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.400]   You can't recover that money no matter what.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.120]   So every time the car breaks,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.820]   you've got to face it afresh,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.020]   and ignore the things that have happened in the past.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.020]   This is really difficult to do,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.800]   because we're wired as human beings
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.600]   to think about all those past decisions
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   again and again and again,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.800]   and kind of bring the weight
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.640]   of all of those difficult circumstances
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.100]   to our present decision.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.000]   But it's a major logical fallacy.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.160]   You've got to avoid that.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.480]   So you've got to begin with zero-based thinking,
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.360]   and start with a fresh slate.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.060]   Take it with the current decision,
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.120]   the current repair,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.960]   and figure out what do you actually do now,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.740]   and make a fresh decision.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.640]   Every single breakdown or repair is a fresh decision.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.480]   You've got to do your best to ignore the emotion
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.540]   of the feeling of, I've been at the mechanic too much,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.720]   these things have just piled up,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   and this car is always breaking down.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.600]   This accounts for one of the major, major financial mistakes
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.960]   that many people wind up making,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.080]   where the emotion of a vehicle
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.960]   that breaks down several times over several months
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.280]   starts to wear on them.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.880]   And that emotion kind of chips away, chips away,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.280]   chips away, chips away, and over time,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.240]   it just gets heavier and heavier and heavier
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   with that feeling.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.300]   And as it wears on you,
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.680]   you wind up in a situation
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.340]   where finally many people just simply snap.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.280]   And when they snap, they say,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.800]   I've had it with this old clunker,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.160]   trot down to the dealership,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.000]   buy another car really quick,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   and they often make poor decisions.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.200]   Many times those poor decisions then follow them
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.740]   for months and years and really hamper their progress.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.800]   This course of action is not for you.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.200]   I recommend you think about it now
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.500]   so that you don't do that.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.720]   When you're looking at the situation of your car repair,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.040]   focus on the actual facts.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   And this is where you need good records
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.440]   and you need good facts.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.360]   Check your records and find out
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.680]   how much you're actually spending on the car.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.280]   If you don't have good financial records,
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.400]   what'll happen is you'll spend 50 bucks here,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.660]   $100 repair there, $287 there,
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.660]   and it'll feel mentally like thousands of dollars.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.140]   But if you can just simply go back
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.320]   and check your financial records
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.280]   and find yourself in a position where you can check,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.080]   you realize, oh, I don't actually have that much.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.280]   If you have those good records
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.240]   and you can go back and check,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.120]   then you can actually know the facts.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.160]   So nickel and dime repairs, if it's ongoing repairs,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.280]   they're emotionally draining,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.240]   but they're not necessarily financially draining.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.000]   Just pay attention to the actual facts.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.460]   Always begin, if you're in a situation where the car's broken
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.760]   with getting the best understanding
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   of the diagnosis of the repair and the potential costs.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.080]   Try to get accurate information.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.040]   Good rule of thumb with any decision
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.420]   is the more information, the better,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.080]   and the slower the decision, the better.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.280]   Anytime you can push off a decision,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.000]   especially a spending decision,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.240]   just a little bit longer,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.840]   buy yourself a little bit more time
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.440]   to think through, research, care for things,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.040]   you'll almost always make a better decision.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.200]   There are exceptions to this rule.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.840]   There might be, maybe, might be some types of opportunities
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.320]   that you need to jump on quickly.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.920]   But those opportunities should be
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.800]   within your area of expertise.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.680]   For example, you might be an expert investor,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.220]   and if there's a company that,
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.020]   or a piece of real estate or something like that
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.060]   that you know a lot about
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.460]   and you just gotta buy right now,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.700]   then go ahead and move quickly.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.520]   But if you don't actually, if you're not an expert,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.700]   buy yourself more time.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.440]   More time, more time, more time is always a good rule.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.860]   Pushing off almost all spending decisions
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.240]   is generally helpful.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.500]   So with car repairs, try to buy yourself more time,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.220]   do more research, get another opinion,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.760]   and get accurate data.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.300]   Try to get an understanding, is this a maintenance item
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.940]   or is this truly a repair item?
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.580]   All cars are gonna have maintenance items.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.260]   Doesn't matter whether they're new cars or they're used cars,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   all cars have maintenance items.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.500]   And so one of the mistakes that people can make
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.180]   is they might have a number of maintenance items
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.660]   that all occur in a bunched together time period.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.780]   They need new tires,
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.580]   then they need to replace the timing belt,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.340]   then the alternator breaks,
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.700]   and then they gotta get a new battery.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.780]   And they're looking at this thing getting so frustrated
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.240]   saying, "I've just spent $1,100 on this car,"
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.620]   when every single one of those things
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.900]   are simple maintenance items.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.280]   They're not a catastrophic breakdown,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.820]   they're not an indication that the car
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.100]   is somehow falling apart and has to be replaced,
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.700]   that's just normal maintenance.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.500]   And all vehicles are gonna require normal maintenance.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.900]   So even if you go and get another car,
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.020]   your problem is not solved.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.420]   You still have to deal with the normal maintenance
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.700]   of that new car.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.380]   The really catastrophic breakdowns are rare.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.600]   They're very rare.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.280]   They do happen, but they're rare.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.720]   My car, the repair I described to you,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.560]   that was a catastrophic breakdown.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.400]   The vehicle was unusable unless I spent
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.520]   the $2,500 on fixing it.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.120]   And I did my research, I could not find any way
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.800]   to get the repair for cheaper than that.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.960]   So it was either spend the $2,500
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.160]   on the catastrophic repair, or the car's unusable.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.200]   But that's really rare.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.340]   Engines don't usually blow up.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.240]   Transmissions don't usually just fall apart.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.600]   And those are the two major components of the vehicle
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.640]   that are gonna actually experience
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.240]   those catastrophic losses.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.480]   Most of the other things are just simple maintenance items.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.160]   So don't let the maintenance items
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.560]   get you down emotionally.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   They might be starting to pile up.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.120]   It might be time to consider a new car.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.920]   We'll get to that more as the show develops.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   But don't let them get you down emotionally.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.640]   As you're looking at your decision criteria,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.720]   and you're considering this decision afresh,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.000]   do some assessments.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.960]   Assess the condition of the car,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.840]   and ask yourself, if this car were repaired,
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.480]   what would be the condition and usefulness of the vehicle?
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.120]   Assess your needs and figure out
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.760]   what the baseline decision is.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.900]   Anytime you're making decisions,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.540]   you wanna start with what is the baseline decision,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.240]   and then compare that decision,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.840]   decision A, we'll call it, to other options.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   Decision B, decision C, decision D.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.240]   So the example here, if you were actually considering
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.720]   purchasing another car, your baseline decision,
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.320]   usually, if you have a broken car,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.960]   is gonna be to repair the car.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.280]   That's almost always going to be the cheaper option.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.140]   So that's gonna be the baseline decision.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.480]   If your car was perfectly good yesterday, before it broke,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.400]   if the car were repaired,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.640]   it would probably still be perfectly good.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.240]   So since repairing the car
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   is almost always gonna be the cheapest option,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.240]   let's just choose that as your base.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.480]   And then everything is gonna be compared to that.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.800]   And you're gonna weigh all the decisions in light of that.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.680]   So reassess your needs, establish the baseline decision,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.640]   and then start comparing them.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.660]   You know the costs, go back and look at them,
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.800]   and you have an estimate of the repair.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.060]   So now we've got a known quality to the car
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.200]   if we were actually to keep that car.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.160]   So that's usually the first decisions.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   Now, are there situations in which
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.800]   you should replace the car?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.640]   Yes, probably.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.400]   But let me give you some of the major reasons
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.840]   why you should keep the car
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.240]   and repair it instead of replacing it.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.720]   Number one, most actual repairs
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   are really not that expensive.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.080]   Maintenance items can add up,
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.400]   especially if they've been deferred.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.040]   But they're really, like I said a moment ago,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.760]   there are very few major, major repairs
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.620]   that happen on cars.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.040]   Next, worse, it's really hard to sell a broken car.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.960]   If your car is actually broken down,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.480]   it's very, very difficult to sell that.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.640]   You've taken your marketplace of opportunities,
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.560]   of potential buyers, from this massive marketplace,
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.700]   and you've broken it down
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.520]   to just this very narrow window of people,
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.960]   a very small number of people
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.920]   that would be willing to take on a vehicle
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.580]   that has an unknown mechanical condition and fix it.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.920]   You're basically dealing with mechanics,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.240]   maybe a professional, or a shade tree mechanic,
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.200]   somebody knows a little something
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.240]   and they can go ahead and fix a few things.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.400]   That's a tiny slice of the marketplace.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.880]   And any time you're selling something,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.720]   you wanna have the most potential buyers possible.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.080]   The more limited the number of your buyers,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920]   the more difficult it's gonna be to sell something,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.360]   and the more difficult it's gonna be
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.120]   to sell something for a really good price.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.560]   So it's really, really hard to sell a broken down car.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.940]   Tiny marketplace, they're experts,
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.720]   and they're gonna be investing labor,
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.600]   so they're gonna wanna deal.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.800]   So almost always, if you fix the car,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.120]   at that point in time,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.860]   if you wanna go out and sell it on the open market,
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.740]   you can do that.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.940]   But you take your potential buyers
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.480]   from this tiny little subset of people,
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.300]   and you expand it to a much bigger marketplace.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.960]   So it's tough to sell a broken car.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.040]   Worse, in general, the biggest cost of car ownership
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.780]   for most people would be the depreciation.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.780]   And when people are sitting there
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.560]   with a car that is broken down or continually breaking down,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.500]   and they're considering, should I replace it,
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.160]   they're usually thinking about upgrading the car
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.480]   to a more expensive car.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.840]   That's usually the consideration.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.120]   It's very rare that somebody is sitting there
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.600]   with a $5,000 car and saying,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.720]   well, this car is breaking down,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.320]   so I'm gonna replace it with this other $5,000 car
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.740]   that's gonna be more reliable and break down less.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.920]   If you're making that decision,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   then if you can go from equal value to equal value
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.740]   to a vehicle that's gonna be breaking down less,
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.280]   that's gonna be a better decision.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.020]   But most people aren't doing that.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.440]   They're gonna upgrade the car.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.240]   So here would be an example from my situation.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.060]   I bought my van for 5,000 bucks.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.520]   The market value when I bought the van
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.760]   was about 7,000 to $7,500 for vans of that type of thing.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.920]   And I'd shopped a lot, worked aggressively
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.280]   to look around and find a deal,
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.920]   and it was a hard deal to find.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.680]   Most minivans were stuck right at that $7,000 to $7,500
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.240]   price range, and then ultimately I found this one,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.920]   and it worked out that I was able to get it at a discount.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.940]   I moved fast, gave the guy cash.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.780]   He wanted to get rid of it.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.440]   It was a business owner, and so it worked out well.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.340]   I was able to get the deal.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.960]   The repair bill, though, was 2,500 bucks.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.920]   So if I were to go out and say,
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.240]   "Okay, I'm just gonna go out and find another van
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.000]   "at market value," I couldn't be assured
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.560]   of being able to find another $5,000 deal.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.840]   And maybe I could have, who knows?
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.120]   Maybe I could have found a better deal,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.320]   but I couldn't be assured of it.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.520]   And knowing how long it had taken
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.920]   to find that $5,000 deal,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   I knew that I needed to,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.320]   I couldn't count on being able to find one.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.280]   So I'm automatically, to replace like with like,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.960]   a van in my current condition
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.040]   with a van in similar condition,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.000]   I'm gonna be moving up to 7,500 bucks.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.360]   Now, at that $7,000 price range,
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.720]   using a 15% estimate on the amount of money
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.120]   that I'm losing every year on depreciation,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.200]   I'm taking a hit of about $1,000 loss
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.760]   every year that I own a vehicle.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.440]   So if I were to go out and buy a $7,000 van,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.400]   a year from now, it's gonna be worth six grand,
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.080]   and I'm gonna be out 1,000 bucks.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.920]   That's kind of a pain.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.600]   Now, the cool thing is by getting the discounted van,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.880]   I've already got more wiggle room in the deal.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.120]   So I automatically have to factor
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.160]   that there's gonna be an additional $1,000 cost
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.640]   of going out and buying the $7,000 van.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.040]   Now, most people, and I wouldn't necessarily,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.160]   I'm not saying this right or wrong,
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.440]   most people wouldn't repair and replace
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.120]   a $7,000 van with a $7,000 van.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.440]   So let's say what would be a more normal consideration
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.520]   for somebody whose vehicle's breaking down, breaking down,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.920]   and they wanna go out and upgrade a little bit.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.160]   What about a $15,000 van?
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   Well, a $15,000 van is gonna lose $2,250 of value
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.640]   in the first year on my ownership and depreciation,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.920]   or basically the same amount of money
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.760]   that it's gonna cost me to repair it.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.720]   But the depreciation is a guaranteed loss,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   and then in year two, there's gonna be another $1,912
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.000]   depreciation, and then in year three,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.360]   there's gonna be more depreciation,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.240]   and more depreciation, and more depreciation.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   But if I'm comparing just the cost of depreciation
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.200]   with the vehicle to the cost of the repair,
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.440]   that catastrophic repair is unlikely to happen
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.840]   in year two or year three or year four.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.720]   It's probably a one-time cost.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.320]   So if I fix the vehicle today, pay the $2,500,
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.920]   yes, I'm equal to going out and replacing it
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.400]   for the next year, but with owning the vehicle
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.720]   at the much lower cost, I'm limiting the downside
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.080]   of the depreciation, and I get to keep more money
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.280]   in my pocket, versus going out and buying
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.840]   the $15,000 vehicle, in which case,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.160]   every year going forward, I'm gonna lose a couple
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.880]   thousand bucks until that value ultimately drops down lower.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.520]   And the bigger the price jump, the worse it is.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.600]   So if you were to jump from a few-thousand-dollar car
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   to a $30,000 vehicle, well, now there's an automatic loss
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.840]   of $4,500 in depreciation in the first year.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.480]   And this is why many people's financial situations
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.160]   are just simply destroyed, especially people
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.560]   who don't have a lot of money.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.400]   They're driving an old car, driving an old car,
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   driving an old car, here's what happens.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.700]   They get frustrated at the continual maintenance items.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.700]   They get frustrated, and then all of a sudden,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.120]   some repair, a $500 repair comes along,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.320]   and now they're just really, really upset.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.080]   And so they go down to the dealership,
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.580]   they make a snap deal on a car that's poorly considered.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.200]   What often ends up happening is they don't make
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.740]   a new car decision wisely.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.600]   They'll buy a cheap car from a cheap brand
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.460]   that doesn't have a good maintenance record,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.400]   doesn't have a good warranty, doesn't have
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.320]   a good name brand.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.840]   They'll buy a Chevy Aveo or a Kia Optima
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   or some type of cheap car that is gonna just depreciate
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.240]   like crazy, and they go out, they make a quick deal,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.800]   massive financing costs, other decisions,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   and they lock in losing $4,500 of depreciation
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.840]   in the first year.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.760]   They bought a $30,000 vehicle instead of paying $800
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.640]   or $1,000 to fix the car.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.760]   Well, you make a cycle of that year by year by year,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.280]   and then over time, your financial situation is destroyed.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.240]   I don't like to lose money, and I recommend
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.800]   that you not lose money either.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.440]   So calculate carefully the cost of depreciation,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.420]   but make sure you also include some of the other costs
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.740]   of transitioning from one vehicle to another.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.920]   Big thing, transaction costs, and those transaction costs
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.540]   really eat into the numbers.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.320]   So again, let's go with my situation
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.260]   when I did this analysis.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.480]   If I were gonna replace my vehicle with a similar
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.720]   comparable vehicle, which my baseline decision
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.360]   was the vehicle I own, 2007 Hyundai Entourage minivan.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.040]   It has the appropriate space, the appropriate amenities
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.880]   that I needed.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.560]   I'm really a fan of the minivan concept.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.000]   It's the best vehicle.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.840]   I use it a lot.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.660]   I use the space.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.080]   It's really, really great.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.720]   And that era is new enough to be appropriate enough,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.160]   but yet it's old enough to have a bunch lower price ranges.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.320]   The age of the vehicle should be good
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.200]   as far as repair items.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.480]   I like basically everything about it.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.780]   And cheap insurance costs, really high safety ratings,
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.300]   et cetera, so I had carefully considered the decision
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.200]   before buying it in the first place.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.240]   So that's what I wanted again.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.280]   So if my $5,000 vehicle that I had paid for,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.560]   I had to make a $2,500 repair,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.440]   but to replace it with a comparable thing,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.960]   I got to spend $7,500.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.880]   What additional expenses?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.360]   We talked about depreciation, but what about new sales tax?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.080]   6% of a $7,500 new vehicle, $450.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.760]   In my state, Florida, it was 6% sales tax rate.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.960]   New registration, tag, titling fees, another 200 bucks.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.920]   So you start adding that first year depreciation
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.280]   to the new tax, to the new titling fees,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.600]   or any other costs.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.960]   Usually when you get a new vehicle, it needs new tires,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   it needs a new battery, it needs new wiper blades,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.320]   it needs all the stuff that somebody ignored.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   Well, now I'm about another $1,700,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.800]   $1,700 to $1,800 of new costs that could be avoided
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.120]   by simply repairing the existing vehicle.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.260]   If I've got new tires on my vehicle, I did.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.860]   Those tires have a lot of life left in them.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.080]   If I've got windshield wipers,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.560]   those windshield wipers have a lot of life left in them.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.200]   Registration costs already paid.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.320]   So when you start adding those costs,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.440]   it adds even more friction to getting the new vehicle.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.980]   And then even worse, I still,
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.600]   if I were to go out and buy a new vehicle,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.520]   I still didn't solve the initial problem
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.920]   of actually selling my old vehicle.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.960]   How do I figure out how to sell this thing
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.460]   in a non-functioning state?
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.940]   Maybe I could sell it to a mechanic for 2,000 bucks,
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.640]   which means then I'm losing all that residual value.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.920]   So even with a really expensive repair like that,
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.380]   you can start to see the massive difference
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.040]   that even facing a big repair,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.440]   it's better to keep it and fix it in most places.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   Another major thing.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.280]   If you impulse buy and you've got to move fast,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.800]   you are now in a bad bargaining position
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.640]   and you'll always lose a deal
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.240]   when you're under time pressure.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.400]   The major way that you're able to get deals
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.860]   is by being patient.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.520]   This is a simple example, buying cars.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.120]   The best deals on a car is often gonna come
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.640]   from a private party, somebody that you find,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.400]   whether it's a car sitting on the side of the road,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.420]   somebody that's in a distressed sale,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.920]   or they're just going through a life event
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.520]   and they wanna be done with it.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.740]   That's usually gonna be the way
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.120]   that you get your best deal on a vehicle.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.400]   But those things are hard to find right now.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.040]   If you wanna go out and buy a car,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.400]   you can usually in most towns,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.600]   you can go drive the country roads
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.240]   and you can find some cars for sale.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.680]   But they might not be in the price range,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.760]   they might not be exactly what you're looking for.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.240]   If you need to buy a car now,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.900]   you've gotta go where they have selection,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.480]   which is going to a dealer.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.900]   Well, the dealer is gonna take the private party value
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.960]   that they paid for it, plus their markup,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.980]   and that's what you're gonna pay.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.480]   So you're paying when you go to a dealer,
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.440]   new, used, doesn't matter,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.720]   you're paying for the convenience and the selection
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.440]   of them having their ability
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.960]   to actually have the vehicle there.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.620]   So if you've got time and you're continually shopping,
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.940]   you can get a deal, but you can't make those deals
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.320]   materialize right when you need them.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   So impulse buying or buying fast
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.400]   means you're automatically gonna pay more money.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.740]   So you're usually better off if you can repair it,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.060]   and then at your leisure,
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.440]   go ahead and look around at upgrading the vehicle.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.060]   So hopefully these examples are helpful
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.420]   when you're looking at the big repair.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.700]   With the little ongoing repairs,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.980]   again, take a look and actually run the numbers
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.620]   and ask yourself, which items are the maintenance items
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.380]   and which items are the repair items?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.040]   All cars are gonna need those maintenance items,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.260]   getting a newer car is not gonna change anything.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.600]   Your newer car is gonna need a battery
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.380]   after two or three years, just like your older car is.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.080]   So look through and carefully tabulate
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.340]   how much is maintenance and how much is repairs,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.140]   and don't let the maintenance items
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.700]   unnecessarily influence your emotions.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.820]   That's just part of the cost of operating a vehicle.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.340]   Regardless, if you do decide that you need to change cars,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.700]   make sure you choose very carefully
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.040]   and do your best to separate the emotion from the decision.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.740]   So if you need to borrow a vehicle from a family member
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.660]   or from a friend who has an extra vehicle,
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.940]   or if you need to rent a car,
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.860]   or if you need to use Uber for a few days,
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.780]   do that so you can go slower and make a good decision.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.740]   Don't compound one bad event in your life
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.020]   with more bad decisions,
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.720]   otherwise you wind up screwed over time.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.540]   So don't compound those bad decisions.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.900]   At some point, break the cycle,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.340]   and if your car is breaking down on you
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.920]   and you need to do a new one, go carefully.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.220]   Buy a reliable car, choose carefully, buy yourself time,
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.100]   let some friends help you out.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.260]   Now, big thing that happens to people,
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.740]   what if the car isn't paid off
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.020]   and you're trying to figure out
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.940]   how do I move on to the next vehicle
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.900]   when the car isn't paid off,
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.180]   and I've got all these repairs?
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.340]   This is one of the major traps that keeps people poor.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.320]   And be aware of it.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.620]   It's, in most cases, not gonna be a problem
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.060]   from this perspective,
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.640]   that since it's usually gonna be better
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.020]   for you to repair the car rather than replace it,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.360]   just repair the car and keep on going.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.680]   But if you repair it and keep paying the loan down
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.720]   until you get out of this trap
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.880]   of owing more on the car than it's worth.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.280]   So don't cut that bad decision.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.320]   If you owe money on the car,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.580]   that's a bad decision to owe money on a depreciating asset.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.240]   So cut it off as quickly as you can, repair the car,
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.480]   and then work on selling it.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.000]   That's always gonna be better.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.600]   The basic thing that you gotta remember with cars
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.160]   is that they're a total money suck.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.460]   And if you wanna be wealthy,
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.220]   you've gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.300]   minimize the amount of money that you lose
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.180]   on things that go down in value.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.260]   So buy the least expensive transportation
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.500]   that meets your needs.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.660]   Clarify the needs,
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.220]   and buy the least expensive transportation
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.500]   that meets your needs.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.380]   There are some times,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.260]   it doesn't necessarily always mean the cheapest of the cheap.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.680]   Cheap is not always cheap.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.620]   Sometimes spending a little bit more
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.860]   is gonna buy you better.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.320]   And sometimes you should buy something more.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.520]   If your car makes you money, choose carefully.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.780]   For example, there's a major cost to downtime.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.600]   If you're actually making money with your vehicles,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.200]   downtime costs you.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.120]   If you are running a fleet of over-the-road delivery trucks,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.440]   those trucks better be in good shape.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.200]   Every hour that one is sitting by the side of the road
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.920]   broken down costs you money.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.360]   And that's a measurable number,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.800]   which is why you'll often see a large company
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.460]   that's running a fleet, their vehicles are newer,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.620]   because there's a cost to downtime.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.500]   If you're making money on a vehicle and actually earning,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.620]   then in that situation,
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.420]   downtime becomes your biggest expense, not depreciation.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.700]   But what about you as an individual person?
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.860]   Does your car make you money?
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.820]   Maybe.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.940]   Maybe your car gets you to work,
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.980]   and this actually really hurts poor people sometimes,
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.540]   that they have cars that are breaking down often,
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.580]   makes them unreliable,
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.580]   it can cause them problems where they're unreliable at work
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.180]   'cause they can't get there.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.540]   Which by the way, helps somebody
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.780]   if they're in that situation.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.620]   Help them get out.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.700]   Give them a few thousand bucks or give them a car.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.220]   Give them your $4,000 car
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.420]   as you're trading up to something nicer
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.340]   so they can have some reliable transportation.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.860]   'Cause that's one way that you can help someone
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.980]   to break that cycle of poverty.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.740]   But as an individual person, we've got more options.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.780]   Don't freak out about the car being broken down.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.960]   In a world of Uber, you're better off than you've ever been.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.780]   Uber is fundamentally transforming things.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.820]   And I am personally much less worried
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.500]   about having unreliable transportation
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.940]   than I ever was in the past.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.980]   Here where I live in Palm Beach County,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.180]   taxis are horrendously expensive.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.340]   And this is a huge county where everything is far away.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.500]   But at this point in time,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.500]   if my car were out of commission for a couple of weeks,
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.540]   it would be not that big a deal to me
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.800]   because number one, I've got a strong family network
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.460]   that can help me out easily and lend me a car.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.740]   I've got a strong friend network.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.820]   People can help me out, lend me a car.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.100]   And I've got Uber.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.540]   And I can get around a few times a week
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.580]   and pay 50, 100, 200 bucks for Uber.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.260]   And that's a lot cheaper than losing thousands of dollars
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.860]   on a much newer and nicer car.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.020]   So what are the things that you can do today
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.420]   to prepare for the eventuality
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.580]   of your car breaking down on you?
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.700]   Plan and save.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:26.540]   If your car is nickel and diming you with ongoing repairs,
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.300]   it might be time to upgrade.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.140]   So the time to make that decision is now,
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.700]   not when you're frustrated at the car breaking down.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.380]   Plan for the upgrade.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.440]   Start shopping for a deal now
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.780]   when you've got time on your side
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.740]   and there's nothing broken on the car.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.540]   That'll help you because you can find the deal,
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.660]   take your time finding what you're gonna buy,
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.020]   and then you can take your time
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.860]   finding the buyer for your car.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.660]   And you can sell it as a working car
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.340]   at a much higher price point than as a broken down car.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.260]   So if your car is nickel and diming you
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.480]   and you've done the analysis
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.620]   of which of these costs are repair items
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.060]   and which of these costs are maintenance items,
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.860]   recognizing that all cars are gonna have maintenance,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.380]   then go ahead and plan.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.140]   Find a good deal.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.900]   Take advantage of the seasonal deals,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.480]   rebates, special incentive programs
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.340]   if you're buying a newer car.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.020]   Take advantage of a friends and family deal
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.020]   when one comes along
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.500]   or when you see a great deal on the side of the road.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.220]   And then plan and save now
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.020]   in case you face a catastrophic repair.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   And it is possible that you could wind up in the situation
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.960]   where your car is simply not worth repairing.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.940]   In that case, have a plan now
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.020]   for what type of car you'd like to buy and why.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.240]   I would encourage you, think ahead at all times
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.920]   about what's the next vehicle that you're gonna buy.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.100]   I know exactly what,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.180]   if my car were totaled in an accident today,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.060]   I know exactly what the next car that I would buy is.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.260]   So have that plan, know the market values
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.860]   so you can keep your ears open.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.860]   And by just simply planning ahead
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.540]   if a catastrophic loss happens
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   and if you run the analysis
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.900]   and you need to buy another one,
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.660]   then you'll make a wiser decision
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.580]   than if you just jump
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.480]   because you're emotionally frustrated.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.540]   Pay attention to brands, pay attention to reliability.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.020]   A lot of the problems that people face,
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.480]   and this is one of the major cycles of poverty that happens
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.780]   is when people make fast decisions
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.100]   and they don't think carefully about them,
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.140]   those decisions tend to compound.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.220]   They buy a flashy, convertible Mustang
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.980]   because it looks cool.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.780]   But they wind up finding out
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.060]   that it's actually a really unreliable car
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.580]   and there's all these expenses that are associated with it
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.700]   and it's really not safe
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.200]   and it's breaking down all the time.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.980]   So then they jump from one thing to the next
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.540]   and they jump to a new car
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.420]   that has all these other things associated with it.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.620]   And these snap decisions, snap decisions, snap decisions,
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.420]   many people repeat them again and again and again and again.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.660]   And then they wind up years later saying,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.620]   but I had to make this decision.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.340]   No, you didn't.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.620]   Stop making bad decisions quickly,
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.380]   slow down, go carefully, and plan ahead
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.660]   and you'll make wiser decisions
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.360]   and hang on to more of your money.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.140]   Wanna touch on two last things and we're done for today.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.100]   Number one, the discussion of the half the value rule.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.100]   That's the only kind of rule of thumb
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.940]   that I've heard people say.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.440]   If your car repairs are gonna cost you
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.340]   more than half the value of the car,
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.820]   then it's probably better to replace the car.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.500]   Take the money, sell it, take the money
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.420]   and put it with your cash and buy the newer car.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.980]   I really can't even,
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.100]   although I understand the sentiment behind it,
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.620]   I can't justify this one.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.380]   I can't make it work for me personally
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.980]   because even if my $4,000 car,
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.620]   I've been in a situation, a $5,000 car
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.180]   and I gotta fix it and it's $2,500,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.100]   I'm still probably better off fixing it,
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.060]   driving the car that's a known quantity
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.300]   and then selling it in the market value
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.460]   as a repaired car versus a broken down car.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.540]   I don't know where to get a good price
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.780]   for a broken down car.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.380]   And I don't know where anyone else would either,
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.940]   unless you were a mechanic and you could fix it up
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.940]   or you had some kind of inside line on it.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.380]   So even that rule of thumb that you'll hear about,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.100]   if the repair is more than half 50% of the value of the car,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.620]   personally, I can't make it work.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.620]   I can't make it make logical sense.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.740]   If any of you guys think I'm wrong,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.500]   I'm happy to be shown why I'm wrong,
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.020]   but I look at it and I just simply say,
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.740]   a working car is better to be sold than a non-working car.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.980]   Second thing, cars last longer than ever.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.460]   So choose carefully, make wise decisions,
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   pay a lot of attention to reliability
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.260]   and when you're paying attention to reliability,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.860]   hopefully you'll wind up better in the long run.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.060]   So don't be scared of a car and run out and trade it in
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.700]   just 'cause it's got 100,000 miles or 200,000 miles.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.020]   Run the actual numbers on your actual situation
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.220]   and make your decisions based on data,
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.180]   not based on an emotional feeling.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.060]   And I believe that if you'll do these things,
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.460]   you will wind up significantly more wealthy over time.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.300]   That's it for today's show.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.060]   That's what I wanted to share with you.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.500]   Hope this is useful to you.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.820]   If any of you have better ideas than me on this one,
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.540]   I would be happy to hear from you.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.540]   If you found have better articles,
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.340]   I have searched to see if anybody else
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.720]   has any good insight on this.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.840]   I've not seen it.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.340]   I've not found any justification
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.540]   for these rules of thumb.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.820]   But what I've learned is that you guys,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.540]   the Radical Personal Finance listening audience
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.380]   are actually a lot smarter than I am.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.580]   So if you've got any really great resources on this,
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.620]   if you think that my perspective on it is wrong,
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.860]   come tell me why.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.460]   Come by the show notes for today's show
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.140]   and let me know why I'm wrong.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.080]   I'd be happy to hear from you
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.940]   because I have struggled and struggled
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.380]   to come up with a good answer for this one.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.720]   But at this point, you've heard my answer.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.260]   Almost always better to repair
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.500]   and then transition over time.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.100]   It's totally cool to buy a newer car,
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.780]   totally cool to buy a fancier car.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.660]   Just do it intentionally and don't do it on an impulse.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.140]   Life's not about being the richest at the end of the day.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.100]   There's a minimum acceptable standard.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.020]   If you're a millionaire,
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.540]   unless you wanna drive around in a $500 car, don't do it.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.880]   You know, drive a nice car.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.540]   But just don't make, I just hate seeing this decision.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.940]   I've seen over the years more mistakes made in this area
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.940]   than anything else that I can think of,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.700]   of people, cars breaking down, dig mechanic bill.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.580]   What do I do?
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.380]   And it's tough.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.680]   It's tough to know what to do.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.060]   So that's it for today's show.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.620]   If you have benefited and appreciated this content,
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.260]   I would thank you for supporting the show.

[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.980]   So at the moment on the Radical Personal Finance
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.120]   patron page, we are up to, let me pull it up here.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:54.380]   We are up to a total of $2,435.35 of monthly support
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:00.480]   from a total of 232 patrons.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.580]   The next milestone goal that we're shooting for
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.140]   with the patron page is $4,000 per month.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.740]   And when we hit $4,000 per month,
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.340]   I'm gonna release a comprehensive video course
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.020]   to the patrons of the show.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.660]   I've figured out that goal.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.100]   I would love to hit that by the end of the year.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.460]   If you'd be willing to support that,
