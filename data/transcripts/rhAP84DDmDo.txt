[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   Today we have a marriage question on the table
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840]   and it's from a listener named Mary.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320]   Hello Pastor John, I know that submission
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.560]   is the requirement of the wife
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.600]   and I've been working hard lately to hold my tongue
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.360]   and agree with my husband,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.440]   even when I have a different opinion.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.120]   Recently he bought a new car.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.400]   I felt in my gut that this was unwise.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.640]   I made one comment to him about it,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.720]   but could see his mind was already made up.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.280]   So it went along with his decision.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.280]   And now it turns out that my gut instinct was right.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.880]   The car purchase was unwise.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.440]   We both know that now.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.520]   And now I feel especially responsible
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.720]   for not trying harder to convince him in the first place.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.560]   Am I at fault for not speaking up?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.160]   I'd like to hear you address the concerns
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.800]   of a disagreeing wife who also wants to submit.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   - I think it's really crucial to step back
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.280]   with a question like this from the immediate question,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   like am I at fault for not speaking up more
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.440]   when my husband was about to make a foolish choice?
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.720]   That's the question, I'll get to it shortly.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   But step back and put the question against the backdrop
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.520]   of three larger perspectives.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.240]   I'm always wanting to do this
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.160]   so that the discussion of complementarianism
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.680]   and manhood and womanhood, male and female,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.880]   sexuality, relationships, roles,
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.340]   are kept in the bigger biblical picture
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.440]   out of which flow a kind of ethos and spirit,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.320]   which is always more important
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.680]   than particular lists of do's and don'ts.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   So the first larger perspective
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520]   would be to remind ourselves
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.280]   that all women and all men,
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680]   all husbands and all wives,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   are fallen and sinful and selfish and foolish.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.300]   And where these things are not being put to death
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.420]   by the spirit, Romans 8:13,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.080]   men are fools and women are fools.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.180]   And I think it's accurate and helpful
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.180]   to be reminded that men and women are equally sinful,
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.820]   equally corrupt, equally prone to selfishness
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.020]   and foolishness.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.020]   Now, to be sure, there are different ways
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.640]   that manhood expresses its sinfulness.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   I mean, a person should give a good deal of thought
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   to why it is that 93% of all incarcerated people
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.820]   in America are men.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.820]   Let that sink in, 156,000 compared to 11,000.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.320]   That has something to do not
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.600]   with greater levels of sinfulness,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   but greater levels of peculiar manlike sinfulness,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.700]   which somebody should really think hard about.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.440]   And there are different ways
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.020]   that womanhood expresses its sinfulness,
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.960]   but selfishness and foolishness
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.460]   are no respecter of sexuality,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.460]   which means that this woman's question is not unusual.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.360]   This is an everyday struggle, I dare say.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.000]   At times, in every marriage,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.500]   a husband who does not seek or welcome
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   or concede to his wife's wisdom, like a fool.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.660]   A wife who will not heed her husband's wise counsel
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.600]   about some of her ways, like a fool.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.480]   The second larger perspective
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.180]   in which the question needs to be framed
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   is the breadth and depth
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.700]   of the biblical teaching on submission.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.960]   The Bible portrays godly children
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.560]   as submissive to parents,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   godly citizens as submissive to government,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660]   godly church members as submissive to their leaders,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.940]   godly slaves as submissive to their masters,
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.160]   godly wives as submissive to their husbands.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.360]   And lest we think that's the extent of it,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.920]   like we gotta figure out every role
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.520]   and how everybody does the dance in these roles,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.400]   lest we think that's the extent of it,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Jesus said, "Whoever would be great must be your servant,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.880]   "must be the servant of everyone."
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.520]   Okay, go add that to the submission mix.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.660]   And he said, "Bless those who curse you,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.680]   "pray for those who abuse you.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.640]   "If someone strikes you on the cheek,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.320]   "turn to him the other also.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.080]   "If someone demands that you go one mile, go with him too.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.280]   "If they take your coat, give him your shirt also."
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   And Paul said, "We should count everyone,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   "everyone more significant than ourselves.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.520]   "And don't just look to your own interest,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.920]   "but look to the interests of others."
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.560]   In other words, humility, servanthood,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.520]   submission are not a sidebar.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.600]   Goodness, they're not a sidebar in the New Testament.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   They are pervasive and foundational.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.600]   It is, Paul says in Philippians 2, 5 to 8,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.680]   the mind of Christ.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.600]   This entire emphasis of the New Testament
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.660]   is as prominent as it is, I believe,
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.660]   because God intends for Christ to be exalted
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.320]   usually and normatively,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.560]   I'm choosing my words carefully here,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.260]   by attitudes and actions that show others
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.960]   that we are so content and so secure in Christ
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.000]   that we don't need to be vengeful
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   or dominating or self-exalting.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.020]   That's what's behind that whole motif.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.220]   Our security, our contentment, our identity
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.620]   is in being the blood-bought,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.140]   universe-inheriting children of God.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.140]   And what a freedom that brings into all relationships.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.340]   And that bigger perspective has two effects,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.500]   at least on the unique ways of existence
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.880]   called male and female, manhood and womanhood.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.740]   One effect is to keep in front of our eyes
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   that the point of humility and servanthood and submission
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.820]   is the display of the universal lordship of Jesus Christ
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.660]   over all his people, all the time, in every way,
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.260]   so that every dimension of our relational behavior
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.140]   makes him look glorious and all-satisfying
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.140]   and makes ourselves look dependent on him.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.820]   That's the point of every relationship.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.500]   And the other effect of this perspective
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   is to remind us that the universal servanthood
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.260]   and humility and submission of all Christians
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.700]   does not nullify the God-given
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.060]   creational differences between male and female,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.180]   but rather sets us on a quest
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.900]   to discern the peculiar ways, the special ways,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.700]   in which a man's headship and leadership displays
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.820]   his humility and servanthood,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.500]   and the peculiar ways in which a woman responds
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   to that leadership, humbly, submissively, servant-like.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.980]   Here's the third perspective that we need to keep in view,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.180]   namely, that in marriage, the aim is to dramatize
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.060]   the covenant-keeping relationship
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.940]   between Christ and the church.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.820]   That's the main purpose of marriage, as God created it,
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.140]   with the husband taking his cues primarily from Christ
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.580]   and the wife taking her cues primarily from the church,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.980]   as Paul describes it in Ephesians 5.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.900]   And this parable of Christ and the church
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.980]   does not become meaningless,
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.180]   even though husbands, unlike Christ,
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.480]   are sinful, selfish, finite, and foolish.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.060]   Christ is none of those things.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.540]   So just like manhood and womanhood
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.380]   in their creaturely natural reality remain relevant
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.300]   for how humility and servanthood express themselves,
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.860]   so also Christ and the church,
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.620]   as models of the marriage drama, remain relevant,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.320]   even though the husband is so unlike Christ
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.540]   in significant ways.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.580]   Now, those are the three larger perspectives
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580]   that need to be kept in view, I think,
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.580]   meditated on as we ask this wife's particular question.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.980]   And what she asked was,
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.100]   am I at fault for not speaking up
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.980]   when my husband was about to make a decision
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.180]   I thought was foolish,
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.980]   or at least not speaking up more persistently?
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.820]   And my answer to this question is,
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.780]   in her particular case, I don't know.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.700]   And a brief explanation for why I don't know
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.180]   will, I think, help her answer the question
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.440]   for herself biblically.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.460]   The reason I don't know
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.460]   is not because it's always right or always wrong
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.460]   for a woman to share her wisdom with her husband
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.060]   about actions he's about to take.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.060]   It's not always wrong, and it's not always right.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.260]   It's not always wrong
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.980]   because even in the church's relationship to Christ,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.500]   we, the church, let our will, our desires,
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.720]   our wants be known.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.780]   What we think is wise be known in prayer.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.180]   That's what prayer is,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.740]   and telling God what we would like him to do.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.380]   And since Christ, being perfect,
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.900]   does not need our counsel at all, thank you very much,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.580]   he doesn't need our prayers
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.220]   to tell him how to run the world,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.140]   but welcomes it,
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.460]   how much more is it fitting for a wife
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   to let her requests be made known
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.980]   concerning what's about to happen in the marriage?
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.360]   And there are numerous other reasons
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.220]   why it would not always be wrong
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.900]   for a wife to register her concern
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.120]   and her wisdom about the decision
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.940]   the husband is about to make.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.700]   But I say it's not always right either
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.440]   because the rightness of it
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.160]   depends on, in part, timing,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   demeanor, tone of voice,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   a choice of language,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.880]   a history of the husband's chronic stupidity
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.480]   or a wife's chronic nagging.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.160]   There are just way, way too many factors
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.720]   that I don't know about in this case
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.480]   to say whether her mentioning it once was exactly right
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.080]   or whether she should have leaned in more.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.400]   I just would have to know so much more
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.520]   in order to make any judgment call
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.920]   about whether she did exactly the right thing
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.840]   or maybe she should have done more.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.880]   But in general, I would say,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.800]   in a healthy, biblical marriage,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   a husband would quite ordinarily seek,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   very normally seek and welcome his wife's wisdom
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.080]   and the wife would have the maturity and wisdom and grace
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.180]   to give that wisdom without dishonoring her husband
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.340]   or communicating that he's an unworthy leader of the home.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.720]   What I hope is obvious in all of this
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.120]   is that biblical manhood and womanhood
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.200]   in the relationship of marriage
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.360]   does not consist in a mere list
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.080]   of things you may or may not say,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.680]   things you may or may not do,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.160]   but rather in a biblically informed,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   spirit-shaped disposition and demeanor
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.980]   that reflects a man's unique calling
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.860]   to be the head of the home and a woman's unique calling
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.140]   to gladly support that calling of the man
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.180]   by coming alongside him
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.180]   with her unique, indispensable, womanly gifts.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.560]   - Good word.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.580]   Thank you for walking through all of that for us,
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.740]   Pastor John.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.740]   And thanks for joining us today on the podcast
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.400]   for our feed, our archive,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.880]   or to send us a question of your own,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.440]   go online to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.400]   Next time we're going to look at the love of money
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.720]   and ask what is its opposite?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.040]   What's the converse to the love of money?
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.740]   Such a huge and important question
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.200]   and we have to answer it right.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.080]   I hope you won't miss it.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.620]   That's up next time.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.740]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.940]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.340]   Thanks for joining us today.
