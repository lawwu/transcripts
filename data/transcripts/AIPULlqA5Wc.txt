[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   A lot of forecasters estimate that energy production and demand on Earth will grow
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.800]   to roughly 2x from where we sit today by the end of the century.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.160]   And I think that there's other ways to look at the demand forecast,
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.200]   which is that you can look at GDP per capita
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.240]   and energy consumption per capita over time,
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.160]   and you always see that for every 1% increase in GDP per capita,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.400]   you see a 1.2% roughly increase in energy consumption per capita.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.600]   And by that measure, based on population and GDP growth through the century,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.360]   we will need to produce five times more energy than we make on Earth today
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.600]   by the end of the century.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.080]   And you can't do that by just pumping oil and gas out of the ground.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400]   We need another technology,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   or we need some renewable systems to scale up more quickly.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.200]   And fusion presents this great kind of sea-change opportunity moment
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.520]   for how we make energy,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.200]   leveraging the technology of the sun.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.160]   And so I'm really excited today to invite
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   the two most funded, most high-profile fusion technology entrepreneurs,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.040]   Bob Momgard and David Kirtley,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.920]   CEOs of Commonwealth Fusion and Helion.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080]   Bob, as the founder of Commonwealth, spun out of MIT,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.000]   where he got his PhD in applied plasma physics,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.840]   and he's raised more than $2 billion from global investors.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.120]   You heard Vinod talk about his original investment in Commonwealth yesterday.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.560]   After Bob, we'll hear from David,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.880]   who founded Helion after 15 years as a principal investigator
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.960]   and fusion lead at MSNW,
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.320]   and before that, seven years as a scientist for the Air Force Research Lab.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.560]   David got his PhD in aerospace engineering from Michigan.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.200]   Helion's raised about $2.2 billion since its founding,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.160]   with a recent massive $500 million funding round,
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   led by Sam Altman, who we all know is the CEO of OpenAI
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.080]   and formerly Ran Y Combinator.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.640]   Sam invested $375 million personally in that round.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.200]   So, please join me.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.800]   They're each going to give a presentation,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.680]   and then we are going to come back and have a conversation
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.560]   with both of them at the same time.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.560]   Please join me in welcoming Bob to the stage.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   (music)
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   (music)
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   (music)
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   (music)
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   (music)
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   (music)
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.160]   - That's a lot of capital for fusion.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   It's exciting.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.840]   So, I'm setting off, you know, our science morning.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560]   So, we're going to later hear about tiny things and viruses,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.440]   and I'm going to start by talking about the biggest thing there is,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.160]   which is the universe.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.360]   So, this is a picture from the James Webb Telescope,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.960]   and what that is is the oldest galaxies that we can see.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   And really what the James Webb Telescope is
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.080]   is a really fancy, expensive camera to look at fusion power plants.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.560]   Because that is everywhere you look is fusion power plants.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   Fusion power plants are the things that built every single atom
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   that's in all of you,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.920]   that's in all these buildings, everywhere on Earth.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   And the reason it works that way
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.000]   is because the fusion reaction,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400]   the reaction that happens inside all the stars,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.800]   it's actually the most prevalent reaction in the entire universe,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   that reaction produces energy
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.520]   that's about 200 million times more energy per mass used
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.840]   than a chemical reaction.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.440]   So, when you think about anything in your life that's chemical,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.920]   oil, gas, 50 gigatons a year of CO2,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   divide it by, like, order 100 million.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.080]   And if you replace that process with a fusion process,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.880]   that's what you get at the end.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.320]   And that's why we can have billions of years old of a universe
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.240]   and billions of years old of our own planet.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.360]   And so, what these companies are trying to do,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.600]   there's like 70 fusion companies,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.720]   is what we're trying to do is we're trying to take that reaction
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   and put it in a bottle,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   in a machine that we can build here,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.480]   and that we can build quickly.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.920]   So, there's many different ways to build that type of machine.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   We, I would say today, don't know what the penultimate
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.600]   or ultimate machine will look like,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.800]   but we know that we're close enough to actually start building them.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   And if you do this, you end up with a new type of power plant.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   You end up with a power plant that looks like a power plant we already do,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.560]   meaning you can put it somewhere, it generates electricity,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.520]   it generates heat that you can take to electricity,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.320]   you can plug it in the grid, you can finance it,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.200]   you can use existing supply chains.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.240]   But now, it doesn't have emissions,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.600]   and basically, it doesn't have any fuel.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.080]   And every one of your energy uses for your entire life
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   could be fulfilled with like a single glass of water.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.360]   And so, that's like a sea change in how you think about
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.680]   the relation between our species, the planet, and energy.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.920]   So, the question is, can you actually build such machines?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.960]   Well, right now, we're building them around the world.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.800]   So, this is a picture of Commonwealth Fusion Systems site.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.280]   It's in a suburb about an hour outside of Boston.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.120]   And this, two years ago, was a forest, old military base.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.440]   And in the upper side of this is a factory,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.840]   a factory to make magnets, key pieces of fusion machines.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.440]   But down in front is a prototype fusion power plant.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.320]   It's a machine we call Spark.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   And that machine is basically the culmination
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.840]   of about 60 years of science done around the world.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.080]   We've been working on fusion since actually before we split the atom.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.240]   And in that time, the scientists at national labs and universities
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.480]   have gotten better and better at building successive generations of those machines.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.520]   And in fact, the performance of those machines,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.000]   and the metrics that you care about if you're into plasma physics like I am,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.400]   that performance has gone up faster than Moore's Law.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.560]   And it's now sitting at the point where you can almost get more power out
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.080]   from this reaction than it took to make the reaction start.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   To do that, what you're building is you're building machines
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.320]   that literally, like, make star stuff.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.680]   They're machines that have plasmas inside them that are 100 million degrees.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.400]   It's like five times hotter than the center of the sun.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.360]   You know, Fahrenheit, Celsius, doesn't really matter.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   100 million, huge number.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.880]   (Laughter)
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   And they do this using basically stuff that we already know how to build.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.440]   It's kind of a unique situation.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.680]   Like, this is the size of a Walmart built by companies that build Walmarts.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.120]   And it's got buildings that house equipment
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.560]   that is like equipment that you use to do electrified natural gas or solar plants.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.600]   And in the center, in that square in the center,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.840]   is a room where you put the fusion machine.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.400]   And that's what that room looks like.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.520]   And we just opened this room like four or five days ago.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.560]   And that center hole in the middle is where we're going to start assembling
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.120]   a fusion machine that will make about 100 megawatts of heat
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.320]   at somewhere around, it'll be more power out than in,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.360]   maybe even like 10 times more power out than in.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.240]   And that's based on all this science that's been done
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.080]   with a series of partners that include MIT, national labs around the world,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.440]   all peer-reviewed, published, and what the predictions are going to be.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.960]   And we think that this machine will be the first commercial machine
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.320]   to make more power out than in.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.960]   You can see on the bottom what it will look like when it's installed there.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.400]   And we're about halfway through the manufacture and assembly of this machine.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.440]   So when you think about $2 billion raised,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.880]   and like tough tech, and like what it takes to actually bend curves in climate,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.920]   this is the type of stuff that you have to be willing to do.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.160]   You have to be willing to take science, cutting edge,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160]   wrap it with the ability to execute things like manufacturing
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.760]   and construction in a package that you could scale.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.440]   Because our climate crisis is going to require
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   us to build somewhere on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 power plants.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.800]   So today, there's about 60,000 power plants in the world.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.760]   And so you're not going to solve this by like making little things.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.400]   You're going to solve this by making big bets, big changes.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   And that's even just through places that we have today.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.320]   We talk about 5x-ing the amount of energy we're going to use
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.760]   on the planet Earth, humanity.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.080]   Like that's one of the largest construction booms in human history.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.360]   And so we're trying to get it started here.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.600]   And one of the great things that you can see about fusion
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.720]   is that once you get the formula figured out,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.600]   once you figure out how to build one of these machines,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.120]   you get a thing that makes a lot of energy out of a small thing
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.800]   that you manufacture, a thing that you build a factory to make more of.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.280]   And it's a factory that kind of looks like an automobile factory
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.760]   or like a rocket factory.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.440]   And in fact, a lot of the people at this company
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120]   came exactly from those areas,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.400]   that were trained in new space, in new automotive.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.040]   Which means like once you figure this out,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.920]   you could build lots of these very quickly.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   And so this is some pictures inside that factory on that site
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   of us building the different pieces that go inside that fusion machine.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   And we'll start to assemble that machine later this year
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.240]   and turn it on in the sort of 2025 timeframe
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.800]   and get to Q greater than one, more power out than in for the first time,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.440]   probably early 2026.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.520]   And that's part of a long-term plan that we've been on in the last five years
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   since launching Commonwealth Fusion Systems.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.800]   We start with the science that we already know how to do,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.760]   that's today you can go and see fusion machines around the world.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.040]   We've built about 150 fusion machines at national labs and universities,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.520]   coupled with an entirely new type of technology,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.080]   in our case, an extremely strong magnet.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.720]   A magnet's made out of a new type of superconductor,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.560]   not the one that you read about recently, that was all bunk,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.840]   but the one that was previous Nobel Prize,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.880]   that allows us to go to extremely high magnetic fields,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   which allows us to build these machines
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.280]   that you could not have built five years ago.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.720]   They're 10 times smaller for the same performance,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.520]   using the same science that we already know how to do.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.920]   And they set up a power plant, like the one on the right,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.800]   that is like a 400-megawatt power plant, like the size of a coal plant.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.080]   So you can imagine going to a coal site, taking out the boiler,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.400]   and putting in this new kit, once it's proven,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.960]   and turning it on, pushing a button,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.440]   and having a whole bunch of heat come out
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.040]   in a reaction that is the most common reaction in the universe,
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.320]   taking your hand off the button, stopping it,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   pushing again and going,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   and doing that in a way that you could then build over and over again.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.360]   That's like the big promise.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.880]   In terms of where people are, it's the beginning of a race.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.960]   About $6 billion invested in fusion,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.240]   which means that one of the most invested
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.160]   of the new energy technology companies.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.520]   So when you think about geothermal or batteries,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.040]   this is actually a next-generation battery.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   This is actually a similar scale.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   And it's going through a history of technology path that's well-worn.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.000]   And we can actually milestone where all these companies are
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.440]   and all these techniques are.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.880]   You know, today you can go and see lots of companies and lots of labs
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.200]   where they make plasmas that are sort of like the idea of an airplane.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.040]   There's some that can get plasmas pretty hot.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.320]   There's a few, including the companies we're talking about here,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.560]   who can actually get plasmas into the right conditions,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.640]   the 100 million degrees, that are insulated well enough,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   that are in the conditions for that reaction to happen.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.440]   And now we're at step four,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.640]   which is to make these things make more power out than in,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.960]   Q greater than one.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.080]   And we know that's doable because actually in December,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.320]   a very large laser in California called NIF created those conditions,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.280]   granted in a completely non-commercially relevant way,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   but in a scientifically relevant way,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.760]   created for an instant, picosecond, those conditions.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.280]   And now it's a race to build things like Spark
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.200]   to do that in a commercial way.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   And after that, there'll be plenty left to do,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.000]   but we'll know that we've taken a scientific idea
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.840]   and turned it into an engineering project and a scaling project.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.040]   And we don't know what the world will do with that.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   It's potentially something that could really disrupt things.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   And I think, as I think about everyone planning,
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.640]   you've got to be able to plan for that.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.200]   You've got to be able to build a fast-track on-ramp
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   to these extremely disruptive technologies.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.760]   And whether it's fusion or gene editing,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.440]   I think that's where the future is.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.480]   And it's an interdisciplinary problem,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.560]   and it's a problem that takes audacity, capital,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.320]   smart people all working together.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.600]   So thank you. That's where we're at.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.040]   I'm looking forward to the discussion. Thank you.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   (Applause)
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.440]   Thanks.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.840]   And I'm excited to welcome a colleague here, David Kirtley,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.680]   to tell you the other exciting things about fusion.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   (Music)
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   (Music ends)
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   Hi. Perfect. Thank you very much, Bob.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   So my name is David Kirtley. I'm a founder of Helion Energy.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   I'm excited to talk about our approach to fusion
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   that we think rapidly accelerates the timeline for fusion.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   Bob, I think, did a great job of talking about the history of fusion,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   where we come from, and the speed of what we want to get there.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   I'm going to be a little more selfish and talk about myself today
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.680]   and give you a little bit of the fusion journey I've been on
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   and why I've come from being a fusion skeptic
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   that I think many people in this audience have.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   So I went into school in my academic part of my career
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   to do something, what I thought was important for the world,
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   and David did a really great job of talking about the impact of energy
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   and the cost of electricity on the world.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   So I said, "Great. I'm going to go solve that problem."
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   I then a little naively looked to the universe and said,
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   "Great. There are fusions out there.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   It's where most of the mass and the energy in the universe comes from.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.680]   I should do that, and we should bring that here on Earth."
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   Got into it. I actually became an expert in some of the inertial-type approaches,
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   like the laser systems.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   Actually, my specialty was antimatter. Antimatter is cool.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   But what I learned was that, actually, the technologies of the time,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   when I was learning, that I learned in school,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   that if I could do something like this, and we all sort of see that in the world,
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   they're going to work.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   But when they do, I will have already retired,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   if not actually be alive to turn on the machines I was going to go build.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   So I pivoted my career, went and built space propulsion systems and rockets,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   plasma thrusters, hull thrusters, ion engines, that kind of thing.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   It wasn't until I met our core founding team
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   that I saw another way to do fusion
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   that potentially rapidly skips over some of the steps of what others are doing.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   So that's what I want to introduce you to today.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   Our technology, the way we want to do fusion,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   that we believe gets humanity to fusion as soon as possible.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   So Bob did a great job of talking about magnetic confinements,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   steady fusion, trying to replicate what happens in the sun.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   There's inertial confinement, which is very high-intensity,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   picosecond pulsed fusion.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   And we do something that takes some of both of those approaches.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   We cleverly call it magneto-inertial fusion,
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   which does the sun in a bottle take a magnetic field
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   to hold that 100 million degrees,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   but rather than trying to hold on to it, get it hot enough and ignite it,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   we actually then squeeze it as fast as possible
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   with very large pulsed electric currents.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   And so that's what we've been able to build today.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   One of the key--this is a picture of our sixth-generation machine
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   that we have up in the Seattle area.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   And one of the keys to the approach to this fusion--
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   we're going to dig into the technology a little bit
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   and then talk about the benefits--
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   but one of the keys is that what we focus on is the electricity part.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   And I think that for me, getting into fusion
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   wasn't to explore cool new technologies.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   It was actually to generate electricity.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   And so that's been our focus.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   And so how we do that is a little unique,
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   and we believe that lets us build systems faster and smaller.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   And so let's dig into that.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   You've seen some of the tokamak systems, which look like big donuts.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   The laser system is a giant sphere,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   so we decided we should go and do a cylinder.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   And so these systems are long, elongated cylinders
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   where we have--on either end, we have our fuel injector--
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   call it formation--but this is where we put in the fuel,
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   put in this mixture of hydrogen and helium
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   that becomes the fusion fuel.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.680]   A center acceleration section where we accelerate that to a core,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   and in that core is where we compress.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   Think about a piston in a combustion engine
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   where we can compress that fusion fuel.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   And then also number four on here is electricity recapture.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   For our systems, we require big capacitor banks.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   It's actually one of the hardest parts of our technology,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   is the electronics, the power electronics.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   And so we have a dedicated system to do that.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   And it's one of the enabling technologies for this way to do fusion
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.680]   is that when this was first theorized in the 1950s,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   we had no idea how to build those pulse power systems
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   that could reliably and repeatedly do this.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.680]   But we can do it today.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   So here's a little animation of how these systems work.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   On either end, we inject our fusion fuel.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   We heat it. At this point, it's relatively cold.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   It's about 5 million degrees or so.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   We accelerate to the center compression area
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   where we then squeeze it, increasing pressure and density and temperature
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   until we get to fusion conditions over 100 million degrees.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   These helions and deuterons fuse to form helium or alpha particles
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   and protons.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   Those are trapped in that magnetic field.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   And as that heat, that hot plasma expands,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   we pull that energy out directly,
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   directly recapturing that electricity.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   Sounds pretty fantastical.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   I'm showing you a lot of 3D drawings and all that stuff.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   The fact is, though, we built this.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   And this was the key for me.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   This is when I went from-- I was a skeptic,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   and then we had this cool idea, and we went out to try to build it.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   But we actually had to build the thing.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   We had to build it, turn it on, prove that technology.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   And so we did that.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   In 2008, we built a machine that did thermonuclear for fusion
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   for the first time.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   That machine was about a million and a half bucks,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   and it set records for temperature, density, pressure.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   I personally helped build that thing a little bit.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   They don't let me touch wrenches too much.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   And actually produced fusion reactions with it
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   and measured those reactions.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   And at that point, I said, "Look, holy shit.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   I have the answer to this.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   Let's go try to figure out how to build a business around it."
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   And as I think we'll probably talk today,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   it turns out that's hard too.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   But in the process of doing that,
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   we've now built six machines that do fusion.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   The latest one we call Trenta,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   that one exceeded 100 million degrees.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   We're the first private company to do that.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   We did DD fusion.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   We actually did D-helium-3 fusion,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   where we actually took rare helium-3 and fused it with deuterium.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   But again, we think we're the first company to ever do that,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   maybe even the first group to ever do that.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   And then the most important thing, I think,
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   is we need to recapture this electricity.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   And so that's the first machine we built with private funding in 2014,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   was a machine that took energy from those capacitors and those pulse power
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   and then very quickly in microseconds put that energy into a magnetic core,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   and then we then recovered that magnetic energy back to the capacitors.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   The key there is we did that at 95% efficiency.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   And if you can do that, that means the fusion only has to do the 5%.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   And so we believe that means that you can build fusion systems
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   orders of magnitude smaller and faster
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   and skip over some of the big steps of cooling towers and steam turbines
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   and inefficient systems you have to do.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   And a lot of that comes from looking at fusion,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   not from just looking at the science, which is really critical,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   but also looking at the engineering.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   I want to build power plants that make electricity.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   And if that's your singular focus, if that's your goal,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   if that's where you're targeted,
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   you make design engineering decisions to get there faster.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   So that's what we were able to do.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   I think that a lot of the private fusion companies in the world
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   are also now targeting electricity.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   How do we get there and how do we get there fast?
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   So that's what we're doing now.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   We're building actually--so in the pictures you see here on the top right,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   that's our seventh generation machine.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   We call this one Polaris.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   We're building that system today up in Everett, Washington,
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   outside of Seattle and installing it in our generator building.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   We actually have an operational plasma injector machine.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   I love saying plasma injector machine.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   To actually do the fusion, to start that fusion process,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   to try to get to even higher temperatures
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   than that 100 million degrees that we did before.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   And we started mass manufacturing those key components
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   that we can't get anywhere else in the world of capacitors.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   And so we're, we believe, the first U.S. manufacturer in decades
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   to start manufacturing capacitors here in the U.S.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   Maybe we'll sell them one day,
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   but right now we're using everything we can make for Polaris,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   for that next system.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   And the exciting announcement, announcing thing--
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   exciting thing we announced earlier this year
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   is that we had our first customer.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   It's kind of a good thing for a fusion business.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   And so we have--our first customer is Microsoft.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   We have a power purchase agreement to build a power plant with them
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   to come online in 2028.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   This is 50 megawatts.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   50 megawatts is about 40,000 homes.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   And to do that in Washington state.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   It's a pretty audacious goal.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   Five years--it's five very short years--
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   to go build a system that makes commercial electricity.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.680]   We believe we can do that because we built all these fusion systems.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   We have an approach that actually radically shrinks
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   the amount of capital and the timeline to build these.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   And more importantly, we have that singular goal of making electricity
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   and getting it on the grid as absolutely as fast as possible.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   So that's a picture of the new generator building we just built.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   You can't see all the manufacturing on the side there.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   But I'm excited to be able to talk today about the fusion business,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   the fusion industry, and how we get from being a fusion skeptic like I was
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   to being a fusion optimist, and really an optimist for the future.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   We need clean power, and we need it now.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   [applause]
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   [music]
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   Thank you guys for being here.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   This is obviously an exciting challenge,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   a dramatically difficult one, an important one, and an expensive one.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   I just want to talk a little bit about the end state
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   for each of you, your point of view.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   We think about energy prices--there's a lot of ways to think about it--
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   but dollars per kilowatt hour, or pennies per kilowatt hour.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   We buy power off the grid in the U.S. for 12 to 15 cents a kilowatt hour.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   Where do you guys think these systems end up
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   when you think about the amortization cost
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   and what you're going to have to charge to build these systems?
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   Once you're at scale, once you're rolling these systems out at scale,
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   what's your end goal for price per kilowatt hour?
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   I think that's exactly the perfect question to lead in,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.680]   that if you're doing a new technology like this
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   and your goal is electricity, it has to be competitive,
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   and it has to be competitive at scale, at large scale.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   Fusion has a nice opportunity to do that.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   You talk about what's the cost of electricity.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   It comes from OPEX and CAPEX.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   OPEX, our fuel for a 50-megawatt system,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   with a pickup truck worth of fuel,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   you can actually power that system for a decade.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   It's clean, and it's safe, and it's low cost.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   We don't even include it in the OPEX budget.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   The fuel cost is so low.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.680]   If we can get to a state where we have less of PhDs in the control room,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   the actual operating cost then becomes pretty negligible for those systems.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   Then you're left with the capital.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   I think that's been our focus,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   is how do we minimize the capital of those systems,
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   so we can get to a point where we can be really cost competitive.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   I'll give you straight answers.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Our goal with our approach to fusion,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   where we directly recapture the energy,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   is to get to a cent a kilowatt hour or less.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   You can do that with OPEX.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   [applause]
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   I think an important point about this is
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   you build these things, they're CAPEX.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   You eventually get very good at building them.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   When you look at the probability curve,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   you have very, very low numbers.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   Eventually, a system like this is basically what the interest rate is,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   is what the price of power is,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   because you're just building capital.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   There's no operating cost, there's no fuel.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   The capital you're building is an order of magnitude less stuff
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   than, say, renewable.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   It allows you to get to these very low numbers.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   So you guys have ever been on stage together before like this?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   We're sitting next to each other.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   [laughter]
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   I'm trying to set up a little Tesla-Edison rivalry here, AC/DC.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   [laughter]
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   But no, seriously, there is a--
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   different architectural approaches.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   You each have fairly distinct approaches
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   to getting these plasma to a dense enough,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   high enough energy state condition
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   so that they fuse and produce energy.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.680]   Very different approaches.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   And there are other approaches.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   I think there's, by my track, roughly six general architectures
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   for fusion technology, and you guys are the experts.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   Tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   How do we know you guys win?
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   Why does Tesla win? Why does Edison win?
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   And isn't it the case that ultimately the price of power is going to win?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   And so whatever architecture gets to the lowest price of power
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   is going to take the whole market.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   Yeah, it's a really good question.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   First, you have to make it work, right?
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   There's a lot of architectures,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   and the odds that they all work are low.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   So we've taken the tact of, like,
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   find the architectures that you know are going to work.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   What's the lowest science risk that you can do?
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   Because that price of power, it's not so much architecture-dependent,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   it's learning rate-dependent.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   At the end of the day, the amount of stuff in these things
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   is all about the same.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   And so the faster you get there, the better your cycles are,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   the lower you're going to drive that cost.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   And there's a time component to that too.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   We don't have the time to wait.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   So if Fusion was available today, we'd be buying it.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   Like, you know, no shortage of customer interest.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   But the real energy transition is in the next decade.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   So we need something that we can get there, like, now, as soon as possible.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   So it's not so much like that end state.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   It might be interesting from a futurist standpoint what that end state is.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.680]   It's the path to get there that's going to really determine it.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Yeah, and I think our focus has been--
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   and Bob's is mine as well--is how do we move as fast as possible?
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   How do we iterate? How do we test? How do we build these?
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   Because it's that time that's driving.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   And there's a huge market, you know, 3,000 gigawatts of fossil power.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   It's not necessarily the case that one of you is going to win
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   and one of you is going to lose?
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   No, it's a huge market. It's one out of every $12.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   So it's absolutely huge.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   You think about what's in front of us to redo all the infrastructure.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   There's no way a single company is going to be able to address that entire thing.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   And also it's not the case that the absolute ultimate optimized thing is going to win.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   It's going to be a packaged thing.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   The car you buy today, the way you control it, the way you drive it,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.680]   looks like the car that Henry Ford built.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   Not optimized.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   How you got there.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   I have a two-part question for you.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   I think we all, as laypeople, not in the industry and in the trenches,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   in the arena with you doing this.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   Our question is just very brief on this answer from each of you
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   because the second part is more important, I think.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   What are the chances that collectively, you know, half a dozen startups
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   actually get this done in our lifetimes?
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   What do you put that at?
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   You know, let's say in the next 20, 30 years,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   what are the chances we actually--this is a meaningful part of our energy mixture?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.680]   In the next 20 or 30 years?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   100%.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   I agree.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   Next 10 years if you had to--
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   Scaling in the next 10.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   Yep.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Because 3,000 gigawatts of replacement is going to be hard.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   Well, that's the need for it, but okay.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   You're both convinced it's going to happen.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   So then, knowing that you know that,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   how do you advise the world to look at global warming, fossil fuels?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   Because we're having this very vibrant debate.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   What does happen mean?
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Happen means net positive energy?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   No, no, like buy power into your refrigerator from fusion.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Got it.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   So then, how would that inform how we should look at fossil fuels?
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Because you have a group of people who are debating fossil fuels,
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   and it's become quite religious with global warming, et cetera.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   You guys are scientists who understand global warming and everything.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   Do we need to even worry about the energy mixture today
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   if you're going to get this done?
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   And should we be sweating global warming as much as we are fossil fuel use
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   if the solution is here?
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   And you guys are so confident it's going to be there.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   It's a good question.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   50 gigatons a year for 10 years is a lot of carbon in the atmosphere,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   in a place where we are already at our limits.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   So we need to do this transition,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   and we need to be ready to build out at a very large scale
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   every zero-carbon energy source that you have
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   because the energy needs that we talked about earlier,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   they're terrifying.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   If we need this solution for fusion, but we also need the other thing.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   So it's not even going to be enough to solve that problem.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   And then two of the biggest problems the world faces,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   getting this carbon out of the atmosphere, and I guess water,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   and both of those, a lot of the taking carbon out of the atmosphere
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   is an energy question,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   and desalination is obviously an energy question
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   because you're going to push water through screens.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   So maybe just briefly from each of you,
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   your optimism for the world,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   knowing what you know from being in the trenches every day,
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   food insecurity, energy, water,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   all of these things seem to be really tied.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   So should we be as pessimistic as I think people in the world right now are?
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   How do you look at the world when you go to bed at night?
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   So long term, I mean, I think we should be very optimistic,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   but those problems exist today,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   and we need to be moving as fast as we can to get there.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   So where the sun is shining, we should have solar panels.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   Where the wind is blowing, we should have wind power,
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   and that's still not enough, I believe, anyway.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   And David mentioned power uses doubling over this decade.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   I think that that doesn't include electrification, carbon removal.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   Forecast is wrong.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   I think it way underestimates what we actually can do
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   and what we can do if the cost of power is low enough,
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   and it sidesteps the geopolitics and some of the other challenges
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   of other low-cost sources of carbon-free power.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   So on the question about how it all ties together,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.680]   I look at it as in the end, there are only two fundamental markets--
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   energy and creativity.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   And with those two things-- notice I didn't say human creativity.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   With those two things, you can do all these other stuff.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   And so the faster we get to the things that have massive scale
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   in those two things, the better off we're going to be.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Are we investing enough in fusion right now?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   Because you guys are working with the venture community, I think, largely.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   I don't understand why we're spending all this money on renewables,
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   debating fossil fuels, all this stuff, and not really going for this--
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   I don't want to call what you're doing a hell, Mary, but it's a long ball.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.680]   Why are we not just pushing a lot more government funding into this project
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   if it even had-- we talked about implied odds yesterday over and over--
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   if this does have-- let's say they're delusional
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   and what's going to happen is because they're founders.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   What do you put it at, the chances that they succeed in the next 10 to 20 years?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   Well, I've told investors that I've spoken with that I think there's a 100% chance
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   that the portfolio of 70 fusion companies that exist today
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   that are pursuing this technology will succeed
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   and that we will get low-cost power in the next 20 years at scale.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   So I don't know which architecture wins.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   I don't know which company wins. I don't know who gets there first.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   I don't know how quickly each of them can scale.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   It's hard for me to handicap that, and I don't have a sovereign wealth fund's
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   capacity to build a portfolio of these investments,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   but that would be the right strategy.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   I've told folks I think that the index on where things are valued today--
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   if you took all the fusion companies and their total market value today,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   I would 100% buy that fucking index.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Yeah, so that would argue for--
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   one of the things I thought was inspiring, Chamath, about yesterday's discussion
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   was you were talking about how do we allocate resources,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   and then we were being challenged by some of the speakers,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   "Well, what can you do?"
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   And I think this framing where you're talking about capital allocation,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   you guys are convinced you're going to do it.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   It feels like there's a disconnect between the politicians
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   and how they're spending the resources that we are all giving them.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   I don't know. Can we hear how the IRA serves this opportunity?
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   So I want to make sure that just throwing money at a problem,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   unlimited money at a problem--
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   I was actually just having a conversation with Sam Altman about this--
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   doesn't actually always speed it up.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   You actually have to do it in the right way with the right targets.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   Delivering fusion power and it costs $0.10 a kilowatt hour
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   doesn't actually solve the problem.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.680]   It's got to be that low-cost solution.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   So we need to make sure we're focused on how do we do that.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   For the IRA, a lot of its focus is manufacturing.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   A lot of its focus is scaling manufacturing in the United States.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   So I think that is really valuable.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   And more things like that that are less focused on demonstrating--
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   Are you going to get some of those dollars?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   We'll see.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   You have to prove some stuff before you can access them, right?
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   So on the manufacturing side, there's lots of opportunities
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.680]   to actually bring manufacturing.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   So capacitors are a good example.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   Our current system, 90% of the capacitors that we are going to put into it
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   were purchased overseas because we weren't able to scale
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   our manufacturing internally fast enough to build them all ourselves.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   Bob, you have your own magnet factory.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   Is there funding opportunity for you to support that effort?
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   There is, but it's not nearly what you need.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   Overall, the energy transition needs somewhere--
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   various estimates put it about $9 trillion a year globally,
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   and we are at a tenth of that.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   So I often get frustrated with the capital allocation
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.680]   about how we're splitting the small numbers that we're splitting now.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   It's like, no, they just need to be bigger numbers.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   And it's not a question of do you invest in next-generation technology
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   versus stuff that you can literally go today, take a smokestack down,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   and put a solar farm there.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   It's not either/or here.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   The whole pie has to go bigger.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   Bob, when you hear Freeberg's theoretical proposal,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   is there a way to manifest that into an actual financial device of,
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   hey, here are 70 private companies.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   I'm going to get 5% of each and put it into a private company index?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680]   No.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   No, it's not possible.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   The problem is that the amount of capex that we will need
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   to make this a reality is so gigantic,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.680]   and I think you guys are honest about that,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.680]   that unfortunately you eventually replace the venture capitalists
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   with tens or hundreds or even a few billion dollars
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   with the sovereign wealth funds that you need
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   with hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   And what happens when you get there is that you replace technical people
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   with non-technical people who have to then determine which is going to win.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.680]   And the way that they do that--and this is sort of my question for you guys
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   because you'll have to get prepared for this,
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   so you might as well take a shot at it today--
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   they'll hire consultants and they'll hire other people
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   and they'll say, "Red team, the alternative."
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.680]   They'll look at you and they'll say, "It's tritium breeding rates."
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   They'll look at you and they'll say, "Well, it's a probabilistic generation
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   of protons and who the fuck knows."
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.680]   All this stuff is what they'll say.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   Some will be right, some will be wrong.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   It would be great, whatever you're comfortable doing.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   You can either red team him or you can red team yourself,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   but I would love to understand the rate-limiting technical thing
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   that you're the most worried about, whether it's his solution or your own,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   and vice versa.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   Okay, I'll start off.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   So I look at it as a portfolio approach.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   This approach, right?
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   It's coming from a "What's the final state look like?"
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   It's a simpler machine.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   But the question is, "Can you make it work from a plasma physics standpoint?"
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   So that says, "What's the data look like on the plasma?
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   How is that going?" That's the type of data I'd ask for.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   Our approach on a red team is, "Can we get to the cost?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   Can we simplify it? Plasma looks pretty good.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   It's at the right parameters already.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.680]   Well, how simple can you make that machine?"
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   So you look at our receipts, you look at our factory,
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   because that's where the risks are.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   Has that ever happened about breeding time for you?
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   No, we know the breeding works because that's the way the weapons work.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   And that breeding is at 1.1 times, roughly, no?
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   So it's 20 years then to get basically--
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   No, you have enough to start now that you go on an exponential.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   Okay. And that's your first couple systems you said, right?
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   Yeah, you have enough to do the first 10 systems at least.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   And David, how would you--
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   Yeah, so I would--
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   By the way, I appreciate the intellectual honesty. Thank you for that.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   I don't do that, but thank you.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   And I actually kind of agree with Bob's assessment
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   that our approach to fusion, the FRC compression,
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   was invented in the '80s, not in the '60s.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   And so, yes, there's been lots of scientists
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   and lots of published papers, including by us, a decade ago on this,
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   but there's still work to be done as we're going to push those boundaries
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   and prove in our system, the thing I worry most about, is,
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   "Okay, great. We have these beautiful energy recovery systems
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   operating at 95% efficiency that cut the cap-backs in half or more.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   But they have to work at that high efficiency.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   And if we fail, if it's operating at 5% less efficiency,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   that means I have to do more fusion now.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   They get bigger. They get more expensive."
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   Is there enough of these specific helium isotopes on planet Earth
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.680]   that you can actually generate?
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   Yeah. So, I think both of us think about the fuel system
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   in terms of the tritium or the helions, and where does that come from.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   For us, we make it, deuterium plus deuterium fusing,
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   and you make helium. That presupposes you have a very efficient way to do fusion.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   Exactly.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   And so, that again comes back to what we--
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   Just to connect for everyone, deuterium is a hydrogen atom
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   with an extra neutron in the nucleus,
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   and some percentage of water has deuterium in it.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   So, it's relatively abundant. Is that fair to say?
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   Yeah, one out of every 6,000.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   Tritium is less abundant, so we need to make tritium
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   in order for systems that rely on tritium for their technology fusion to work.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.680]   All the water you drink out there has got deuterium in it.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   My final question--
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   And it's safe in your body, and none of those challenges.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   You wouldn't work without it, actually.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   Tritium, a little different, but--
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   How do you guys think, assuming that the technical issues
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   are packaged in a way where now we have this repeatable thing,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   how do you get the local politician to approve
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   what they will look at as a nuclear reactor
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   and what, unfortunately, the blob will have their own viewpoint on
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   from being installed all around the country?
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   How does that part work, which has nothing to do with science, unfortunately,
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   and is very emotional, and there's a lot of regulatory capture there?
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   When we broke ground on that facility I showed--
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   That's a bedroom community of Boston.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   We had no agreement of who would even regulate it
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   because it's a totally open field, right?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   It's an entirely new technology.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   So you have a social acceptance angle.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   You also have just a pure, like, legally,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   who's going to be the person who's going to tell you to shut it down.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   You have to solve both of those, and they're different.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   They're related, but they're different.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   So it's been an interesting experience to do that at that site.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.680]   Something that just happened is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   in the United States just made a ruling after two years of review
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   that all fusion power plants will be regulated like particle accelerators,
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   not like fission plants.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   That goes from a billion-dollar regulatory overhead
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   to a $10 million regulatory overhead.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   So that machine I just showed, that's regulated by the state of Massachusetts
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   the same way that a hospital cancer treatment center is.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   So boom, legal piece way down.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Public acceptance.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   We've done polls as an industry association
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   that show that the public acceptance of fusion,
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   if messaged the right way--
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   so avoiding trigger words and things like that--
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   that people-- [laughter]
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   "Kaboom" is a trigger word.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   [laughter]
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   They become pretty excited about it.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   You have this moment of conversion where people go from curious
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   to like, "Yes, we need that now."
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   And that's been a broadly seen phenomenon.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   We've got to get it right.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   The chattering classes and the opposition is going to eventually come
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   when these things are more real.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   We have time today to set the momentum and lay the groundwork.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   And I can add two more details on that,
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   that our goal is not just the cost of the regulatory path,
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   for instance, it's speed.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   We went from 10 or 20 years for a nuclear reactor in Georgia
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   where helium has been regulated by the state since 2018.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   Our permits take 6 or 9 months.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   We are licensed, we're inspected, whole nine yards.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   And it all exists. It's not new regulation.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   It totally exists just for hospitals.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   And then the public acceptance piece is, again, speed.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   And so what we do is try not to do what the nuclear industry did
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   as hideaway and say, "Don't worry about what's happening here."
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   What we try to do is we show hardware.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   We tweet about it. Social media is here now, and that helps.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   And so we're out there showing hardware, what we're building,
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   how we're building it, what the dangers are.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   Let's be honest about it so that we can actually address those
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   intellectually, honestly with everyone.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   And then talk about the benefits.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   Let me ask one more question, which I think--
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   I have a final one, but go ahead.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   I think everyone's asked, which is, "Why now?"
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   We've talked about this for 70, 80 years.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   This has been theorized.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   This has been part of an experimentation program somewhere--
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   everywhere for a long time.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   Can you talk a little bit about what's changed in technology,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   all the underlying technologies that allow us to do this today?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Is it electronics, photonics, software and AI,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   low-cost electronic components?
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   We talked about this back in March, David,
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   but Bob, why don't you kick it off and just help us understand
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   why this isn't just BS, because it's always been 20 years away
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.680]   from having free, abundant energy.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   What's changed?
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   One, the science. The science has advanced tremendously.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.680]   We have predictive capability of these machines the same way
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   that we have predictive capability of how to build a plane.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   Two, the adjacent technologies.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   And those adjacent technologies, whether it's magnets
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   or high-power electronics, they've all benefited
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   from huge investments in the last 30 years.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   They basically have been warehoused and are now being applied.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   And three, the idea that software is eating the world,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   well, it didn't really. You need the mouth.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   And that mouth is advanced manufacturing.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   That mouth is how to turn a software business
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   into the ability to manifest hardware that works.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   Those are all combining here with this very big pull.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   And I would just-- I love all the technology answer,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   but also there's a very famous quote in the 1980s
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   of what it would take to get fusion,
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   and they put budgets forward, and nobody wanted to do it.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   There was no investment.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   And the quote is, "The world will have fusion when it needs it."
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   And look at the capital investment in fusion,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   and the companies that are moving fast.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   It is pretty striking. I've talked to a lot of investors
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   who are throwing whatever they can at it because the world needs it.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   When we're doing the prep call for this,
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   we're having an interesting discussion amongst the besties of--
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   obviously, there's applications on Earth for energy,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   but when we get out into the stars and the mission that Elon's working on
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   to get to Mars, Freiburg was wondering, and Sachs particularly,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   will this technology help us get to Mars or perhaps even Uranus?
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   [laughter]
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   Okay. That's a joke. It's a tradition here.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   By the way, if you guys have not listened to our podcast--
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Sorry, Bob. I apologize if you haven't followed us.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   It's a tradition with scientists.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Well, 2,000 of us, we apologize.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   Every science corner, the nerds have to get--
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Set it up in Starfix.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   Please join me in thanking Bob and David.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   [applause]
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   [music]
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   [music]
