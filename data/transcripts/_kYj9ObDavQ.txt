[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   All right, I'm thinking, I've been talking for a while, Jesse, maybe we should do another
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160]   call.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.360]   Let's see if we have someone who can ask us a question here.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.880]   We got a call from Dave.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.880]   He's an architect.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.280]   He's also a manager and he's having trouble scheduling deep work because he doesn't have
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.280]   any time block space for it.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   Hi, Cale.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.120]   My name is Dave Birlkamp.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.680]   I'm an architect working on an in-house design team for a large hospital system.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.880]   I've had great success adopting many of your principles from so good they can't ignore
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.120]   you, to deep work, and most recently, a world without email.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.360]   Your tools have really helped me manage a role with complex responsibilities.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.040]   In the past year or so, I found my role evolving away from an individual contributor to more
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.360]   of a design manager.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.520]   While my position does not have me managing a team of direct reports, I ultimately manage
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.840]   projects and oversee consulting teams, requiring much of my time in collaborative meetings
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   with larger project teams, providing direction and working through design challenges.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.240]   I've started to wonder whether having days with large blocks of deep work is too lofty
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.980]   of a goal for a manager.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.680]   In both reading on the topic as well as talking to other peers in similar manager roles, it
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.840]   seems the common mentality is that a manager is subject to endless meetings and face time
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.080]   with those they're responsible for.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.600]   I can only imagine how much more demanding having a team of direct reports would be.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.680]   This all seems at odds with a deep work philosophy and my own personal values on work and productivity.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.600]   What's your advice for managers trying to incorporate deep work practices with potentially
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.920]   limited deep work time blocks?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.000]   >> Dave, it's a good question.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.480]   So in A World Without Email, my book, A World Without Email, I go into more detail about
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.600]   managers in general and how you deal with issues like focus and distraction when you're
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   dealing with managers.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.320]   So I'm going to summarize four points here, four points about the deep approach to being
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   a manager.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.280]   One, I think you're correct to note that a schedule built around long periods of uninterrupted
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.040]   concentration is often going to be incompatible with the responsibilities of a manager.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.080]   That's not really what they're asking you to do in a lot of cases.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   It's like we're not asking that you on your own create new value from scratch by adding
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   value to information.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.040]   We're actually asking you to manage other people who are doing this.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.940]   So yes, I think that's completely relevant to say long stretches of uninterrupted time
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.240]   might not be reasonable.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.880]   That's fine for a manager.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.720]   Two, the key thing you want to do as a manager, as you would any other position, is prevent
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   context switching to the extent possible, which means you want to be one thing at a
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   time, full attention, so you move on to the next.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.560]   Very important as a manager that you're not multitasking.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.640]   I'm trying to work on this person's problem while also answering Slack messages about
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.600]   this and switching over to that problem.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's a huge cognitive drag.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.480]   You're going to make worst decisions and you're going to get exhausted quicker.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.840]   I actually cite research about this in my book, A World Without Email.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   There's a very relevant study to this discussion where they studied the actual behaviors of
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.320]   managers and they correlated it with the amount of email they were receiving.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.200]   And essentially when managers had more and more email that they were trying to deal with,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.240]   their activities shifted away from what they called leadership type activities and towards
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.920]   much more small productivity focused activities.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.200]   So if you're bouncing back and forth between a lot of things, your managerial scope goes
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.000]   from clear, big picture thinking and directing and towards just more frenetic, small, let
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.720]   me just get the obligation hot potato and get it out of here.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.640]   Let me solve this question, answer this, move this over here as a much less effective way
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   of being a manager.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.480]   So you want to do one thing at a time before you move on to the next.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.680]   To make that possible, we get to point three and four.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.360]   So point three is you want to avoid a sense of overload.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.540]   So if you have more going on, more on your plate, more things that represent an obligation
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.120]   to you that you can really easily even imagine making sense of, you are going to find that
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.200]   the cognitive stress of having such a crowded plate is going to make it quite difficult
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.080]   to really focus on one thing at a time and the resulting overhead of each of these obligations
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.120]   is going to pile up in a way that's going to make it impossible for you to do one thing
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.240]   at a time because there's always the next Zoom meeting, there's always the next email.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.040]   So this is what we've talked about, the overhead spiral.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.360]   We've talked about this before on the show.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   Everything on your plate brings with it some amount of fixed overhead, meetings that have
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.680]   to happen, emails that have to be answered.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.400]   So if you have too many things on your plate as a manager, just that overhead, the checking
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.240]   in, the emails, the meetings will eat up your whole schedule.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.680]   And now it's impossible for you to actually give each thing on your plate, each decision
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.520]   that you need to make, each advising you have to give, each reassignment or helping of an
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   employee.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.720]   You can no longer just give these things the attention they deserve one after another because
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.200]   there's so much Zoom, there's so much conference calls, there's so much email, this overhead
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.600]   of what's on your plate becomes too big.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   So you have to keep that smaller.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.360]   You got to keep that list of what's on my plate smaller.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.000]   And it's gonna mean a lot of like, nope, nope, we're not doing that.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.080]   I'm not doing that.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.280]   We're full right now.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   We're focused.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.600]   Here's what we're working on.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.720]   You have to start protecting how big that list is.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   Don't let people put those things on your plate.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.080]   You say, I can't deal with that right now.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080]   You can bring that to me later.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   Don't put that on my plate.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's critical for actually having the blue space, the blue water, the free space to give
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.620]   things attention one at a time.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.840]   The final and fourth point is through automation and process, you can give yourself more breathing
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.260]   room.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.920]   So obligations that maybe right now you just deal with as they come up.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.200]   One of your reports just emails you and is like, I need approval of this.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.400]   And you're like, Oh God, okay, that's something I have to do.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.680]   And you have to give approval to this pretty soon.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.980]   And it's sitting there on your plate and is a cognitive weight.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.120]   You can take things like those.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.280]   And if you automate them, this is how this type of work always gets done.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.960]   Here's the, here's the process.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   You put things for approval into this drop box.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   Monday after lunch, I go through the drop box and I mark approvals on it.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.080]   Things that are automated, no longer weigh on your mind as an obligation that needs your
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   attention.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.280]   And so you can, in some sense, expand how many things you can have on your plate at
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.820]   a time before you cross that threshold of overload.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.880]   If you take a lot of things from those plates and you put them into automated systems that
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.860]   do not require you to make planning decisions that do not require you at some point to specifically
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.640]   put aside time on an ad hoc, individualized basis to get this thing done.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.320]   So these automation based processes gives you much more breathing room.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.400]   So the stuff you do that happens automatically happens every week happens every month.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   Find systems for that, that means you don't have to keep track of it.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.080]   It's not waiting for you to put aside time to proactively put aside time to execute it.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   You know how that gets done.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.720]   All right, so that can be really important as well.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.060]   This is where hacks like office hours play a big role.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.380]   Small questions, don't just let these pile up.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.620]   Here's my office hours every single day, this hour, come by my office, call me.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.760]   I have a zoom window open, whatever.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.960]   That's where all the small questions go.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.400]   And then that's not piling up on your plate.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.360]   That goes a long way right there as well.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.200]   When building these processes, as I talk about, and as you know, Dave in a world without email,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.140]   minimize the amount of unscheduled messages they require.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.000]   So you want these processes where you can execute commonly occurring work without having
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.040]   there to be ad hoc messages flying back and forth.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.320]   It'll keep you back in your inbox.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   That will help as well.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.740]   So if you want to look at the particular story in that book that really gets at these ideas,
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.740]   look at the story.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.640]   I believe this is in chapter one of general George Marshall and how he completely reorganized
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.260]   the war department, the U S war department during world war two, when he took over as
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.000]   the army chief of staff.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.940]   Cause he reorganized the whole thing so he could work on one thing at a time, the stuff
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.080]   that mattered, give it his full attention.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.520]   And you know what?
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.340]   He would end at five o'clock every day.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.540]   He was managing the U S army during world war two and would finish by five every day.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.760]   He had a heart troubles, didn't want to have a heart attack.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   So that was his hard fix.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   Hitler productivity line.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.840]   I don't work past five and he made it happen by using these type of ideas.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.500]   So go back and read that story.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.840]   If you a listener out there have not read a world without email, you should, and you'll
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.540]   like that story that's right there in chapter one.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.980]   But just to summarize again, Dave, forget long unbroken periods of intense concentration.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.740]   That's not your job, but to working on things one at a time with your full attention before
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.400]   you move on to the next is how you're going to Excel as a manager to make that possible.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   You have to avoid overload by saying no to things and by automating as many things as
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   you can.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   They're already on your plate.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.540]   You do all those things.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.220]   You can like George Marshall win the proverbial war while getting home by five every day.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.220]   [Music]
