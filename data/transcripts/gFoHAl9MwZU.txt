[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   pod. The notorious threesome is here during the show. So today,
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.640]   threesome
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.200]   throuple. It's a throuple. It's a throuple. We have a throuple.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.680]   I think it's more like a cuddle cuddle.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   Okay, the dictator to moth poly up a to rain man David Sacks,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.320]   Sultan of Science, Dave Friedberg. Happy to be here
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.360]   with you guys today. We are absent. Jay cow, taking the week
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   off. Any other housekeeping?
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.440]   Let's do it. Let's jump into it.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.640]   Well, you announced that we're gonna hire a CEO, right?
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.680]   Oh, let's talk about that. How's it going? freeberg in our CEO
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.280]   search.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.960]   Okay, I got to admit, I've had a few conversations, but I got to
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.600]   get through the list. There are 240 applicants. So Wow, and
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.280]   there's some really, like great people in there. So we need to
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.920]   figure out how we're going to manage this. But I think we're
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.480]   pretty excited.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.240]   I can't believe so many people want to work for us. That's
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.760]   insane.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.840]   There's some really great folks. I think the chemical you posted
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.920]   it and people were pretty positive, right? Generally
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.520]   positive. Not
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.640]   Yeah, it was really positive. Yeah. I mean, I think that
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.000]   people were very excited about the fact that we were going to
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.600]   try to kind of like professionalize this a little bit
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.160]   more. So let's just talk about that. We did the all in summit.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.960]   In September, we thought it went really well, folks really
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.160]   enjoyed it. The survey data, the folks that attended was really
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.720]   positive. So we want to do that and do more of that live in
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   person stuff. We all have full time jobs and other things to do
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.040]   so we need someone to come and run this as a business and
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.760]   organize it and carry it forward a little bit for us. And so
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.880]   we're really excited to hopefully get someone that can
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.800]   scale this. No ads ever. No subscription fees, nothing's
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   going to change about the pod.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   So it's a media and events business and it might become a
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.040]   CPG business as well. Meaning was it CPGs consumer packaged
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.680]   goods. That's right. Thanks.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.400]   That is the correct use of the acronym. David. Congratulations.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.760]   Your first product would be what tequila.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.560]   I would do like a tequila or like a hard seltzer or something
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.040]   like that. That seems to be a big growth category. Or we could
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.440]   figure out something very orthogonal. I mean, Mr. Beast
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   did candy bars. And we found out at the all in summit that he's
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.960]   doing something like 250 million a year in revenue growing very
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.480]   fast.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.080]   Yeah, we could do sacks nuts.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   The sacks nuts be too big to eat. You wouldn't be able to
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.840]   fit them in your mouth.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960]   They just be old and salty.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.760]   Well, I think the other thing that's worth figuring out is
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   this idea of like, what is what is the community really look
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.480]   like? I think that's the biggest. Yeah, that's the biggest
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   upside for the CEO is like, is it physical places like zero
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   bond? Or is it virtual sort of like, community oriented things?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.640]   Is it some combination of the two? I'm really interested in
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.400]   trying to figure that out. And what answer they come up with
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.720]   then the other thing that I would really like to experiment
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   with quite honestly, is if we could do a little bit of a tour,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.760]   I just think it would be super fun to kind of go to like five
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.320]   or 10 cities and just kind of like crash those places and have
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.440]   like a big get together and talk to people and do a Q&A. I think
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.280]   the thing that is really fun is just the interactive q&a just
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   because it allows everybody to get involved and then to be able
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.560]   to do dinners with each other. And like, there's just a really
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.720]   amazing community. So that person should be able to figure
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.360]   this out. I don't know the answer to it. But I'm hoping
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.040]   they figure that out.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.560]   We should give a shout out to the guy who did the interview
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   video or submitted. You see that it's like a four minute video
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   that
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.560]   Sean submitted his application by video on on x.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.240]   I think I was on his podcast, Sean. He were. I was on his
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.320]   podcast like a year and a half ago. I think
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.160]   can we pull it up?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.520]   Welcome, welcome to my five minute job application to become
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.240]   CEO of the all in podcast. This is the American dream, baby.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.600]   That's great. Well, he posted a tweet the day before saying if
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.480]   it gets 1000 likes, he'll submit an application instantly got 1000
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   likes, and then he put that video together. So great job,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.080]   Sean. I will be calling you later for your second round
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.560]   interview. I think you're well qualified after that submission.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520]   But I do remember like at the all in summit, I've never been
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   to a conference where I'd say like 95% of the audience was
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.960]   actually in the theater for the entire content session. Like
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.280]   they really sat through it, it was really engaging. So I think
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.360]   that's the sort of product that I'd love to bring. Bring out
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.800]   more, which is some of these important conversations with
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   people that can provide a perspective that folks might not
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.240]   be getting elsewhere. To mark you also mentioned on Twitter
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.000]   that you're doing more content. Like your you called it learn
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.920]   with me. What is that?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.240]   Yeah, I mean, well, I've been doing this for a while, but I
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.960]   just wanted to wrap it up and kind of make it into a clean
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.040]   kind of productized service. So, you know, I have this newsletter
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   that I've been using weekly to just kind of share everything
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.240]   that I read. But then I thought, Okay, why don't I actually like
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.440]   really invest just a little bit of time every week to curate
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.840]   that even a little bit more, and then write little summaries of
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.360]   probably the three most important news topics of the
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.280]   week. And I just kind of give an insight into my process. So when
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   I read all of this stuff, usually two to three times a
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.160]   month, but the average is around twice a month, I end up writing
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.040]   an essay. And it's like one or two pages really quick. And I
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.760]   just keep them for myself. And it's like, right now I'm just I
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.920]   just finished one. What is the Federal Reserve? And the reason
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.440]   I did that was because Druckenmiller was on TV, and he
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.120]   was talking about all this stuff. And I just wanted to
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.160]   remind myself about why the Federal Reserve exists the way
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.840]   it does. But basically, what happens is from these quick
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.080]   essays, and from what I read, I typically start every month, a
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.680]   deep dive where my team and I, we probably allocate at least a
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.720]   month to a month and a half where we figure out something in
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.800]   really excruciating detail, and we generate a slide deck and a
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.720]   write up. And then we take that and we go and we ask a bunch of
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.200]   experts what they think. And then we only keep it within
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.960]   ourselves. But then I thought, you know what, why don't we just
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.600]   start sharing it. So the reason I'm doing this is really to keep
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.800]   myself accountable to keep learning. Because I feel like in
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.400]   the last few years, the thing that I lost most when things
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720]   were going crazy was just the incentive to learn. And I
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.160]   thought, if there are other people around me that are also
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.840]   relying on this, I'll be more accountable. And obviously, to
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.840]   the extent that this thing can actually be self funding, then I
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.720]   can take some of that revenue reinvested in more research
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.800]   associates, maybe publish more content, but it's kind of like
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   all the information I wish I had so that I could make better
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.960]   decisions. I'm just going to kind of take what I have share
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   with everybody, and kind of go from there. So we'll see.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.600]   So you're charging for the kind of higher end part of it
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.520]   at the end of it, like it's a kind of like, I would say most
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.400]   of it is free. The Twitter spaces obviously is not because
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.360]   the point of these are these x spaces is we just don't want a
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.680]   bunch of bots and trolls. But there's a bunch of people that
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.280]   signed up to be a subscriber. So we'll do q&a is monthly for
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.440]   subscribers. And then once a month, I'll publish a deck. And
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.400]   like I said, if you want the full one, then you can be part
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.560]   of like a paying community. Otherwise, you'll get some
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.520]   portion of it for free.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.720]   And then you'll have cash to reinvest in doing more content
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.840]   is
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   like right now I have a couple of research assistants that
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.520]   really helped me and we have a pool of experts that we use but
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.640]   if this thing picks up some steam and we can have enough
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.880]   revenue to hire three or four more RAs maybe at some point
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.800]   instead of monthly we can go by weekly. I don't know. But the
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.680]   idea is just to focus on sort of what I think is interesting. So
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.840]   that I can have a general view of things so that I can make
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.400]   better decisions. And like I said, to the extent people are
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.720]   interested now they can follow along at any level
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.440]   there you have it so people can go to your Twitter to see it
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.800]   right? Yeah. Okay.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.080]   By the way, the other thing is it's kind of cool to be in this
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.800]   like content creator economy. You know, that's the other thing
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   is like, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm on the
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.000]   sidelines looking in at trends now whereas before I was in the
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   middle of them like web 2.0 social, I was right in the heart
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.480]   of it. And I was like, Okay, this is amazing. And then as an
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.720]   investor in SAS and deep tech, I was kind of in the middle of
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.840]   those as well. That felt great. But this last push in AI, I'm
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.000]   like, wow, I'm really on the sidelines looking in or this
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.520]   content creator stuff. So I think it's, it's a good forcing
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.000]   function for me to kind of learn as well
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.040]   to be active in the content creator economy basically to
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.600]   understand it.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.240]   Yeah, I don't know how else I'll ever learn how to because
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.040]   like, I could read all the stuff I want.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.840]   Just so you know, you do a podcast that a lot of people
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.360]   listen to.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   Yeah, but I think that that's like a, it's the lowest order
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.200]   bit, quite honestly. You know, when you see like what Jimmy
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.760]   Donaldson does, or even like Kim Kardashian, what they do as
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.560]   content creators, it's just an intense process that then
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.600]   creates all this upside. So even if what I want to have a more
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.440]   informed view of where all in needs to go, I want to be a
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.000]   little bit more on the ground and actually in the engine room
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.920]   doing it for myself.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.520]   Yeah, since we started doing the pod, Saks has been creating a
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.360]   ton of content to I mean, sex, you wrote a piece this week,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.280]   didn't you? And on Ukraine, or like the Time article on
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.640]   Ukraine, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. Like you weren't doing a lot of
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   content before we started doing the pod, right?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.000]   No, he was he was writing a like a lot of blog posts on SAS.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.560]   Those are excellent. He had like an occasional blog post, but
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.600]   he's like super active now, particularly on Twitter now.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.520]   Like, has that changed a lot?
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.360]   Well, what basically happened is I would express political views
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.880]   on the pod, you know, on a weekly basis. Yeah, I wasn't
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.720]   really tweeting much about politics, but then it all kind
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.400]   of bled together. I mean, once you start talking politics on a
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.080]   pod, people were clipping it, they were putting it on Twitter,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   and then I have to respond to it, maybe correct. Yeah, miss
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.160]   interpretations or respond to attacks or whatever. So all the
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.520]   politics and business stuff just kind of bled together on Twitter,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.640]   it'd be nice if I just had two accounts and people could just
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.520]   follow me for what they wanted to follow. My sub stack is just
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.040]   business. And then I'll occasionally write an op ed on
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.520]   the political stuff. So I've written a few on free speech,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.120]   and then I've written a few on Ukraine. And so I wrote a piece
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.200]   for responsible statecraft this week on Ukraine, which was based
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.120]   on a Time magazine story that came out and then I did a
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.360]   version of it on x kind of a long post, which I called the
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.800]   Ukraine wars Cronkite moment, which described the Cronkite
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.120]   moment in the Vietnam War was that Walter Cronkite, who was
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.880]   the top newscaster, America's most trusted man in the 1960s.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.000]   He went on a fact finding mission for himself to Vietnam,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   and he came back and he said the war is basically unwinnable. And
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.640]   that's when the public sentiment really turned against the
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.440]   Vietnam War, it still took us five years to get out of it. But
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.680]   what Cronkite said, there's a great quote from Cronkite, which
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.200]   I've included at the end, where Cronkite says is increasingly
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.880]   clear to this reporter that the only rational way out will be to
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.320]   negotiate, not as victors, but as honorable people who lived up
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.960]   their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.840]   could. So that's basically what happened in 1968. What happened
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.720]   this week is that Time magazine wrote a cover story on
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.040]   Zelensky, where the main sources for the story were all of
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   Zelensky's aides and advisors. And what they told the Time
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.520]   reporter was effectively this war is unwinnable. And moreover,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.880]   Zelensky is delusional. That was a word they use delusional in in
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.720]   not confronting the battlefield realities that the Ukrainian
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.760]   army had been decimated, and delusional in the sense that he
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.520]   refuses to engage in peace negotiations with the Russians.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.900]   He's utterly unmovable on this idea that Ukraine's gonna
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.520]   somehow prevail. And the troops in the field are basically
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.880]   saying that they cannot follow the orders they're being given.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.960]   They literally they can't advance or being ordered to
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.520]   advance. And the officers in the field, the frontline commanders
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.640]   are rejecting the orders, because they've been decimated
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   so badly, and they they consider the order to be impossible. So I
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.120]   consider this to be the Cronkite moment of the war, when
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.980]   Zelensky his own inner circle is saying that the war is lost. And
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.100]   the only question is, when are we going to realize that? And
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.620]   start negotiating? Are we going to continue until the very end
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:06.180]   here with Zelensky in this psychological bunker that he's
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.280]   created? Or are we going to recognize reality the way that
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.660]   Cronkite urged the nation to in 1968?
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.440]   Do you think these aids to Zelensky proactively reached out
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.840]   to the journalists to try and get this story published? How
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.200]   does a story like this come about that provides this kind of
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.880]   revealing insight on the supposedly inner chamber in
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.920]   Zelensky his operations that can shed so much light on the
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.480]   challenges and with him and with the operation?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.240]   I think it's a really interesting question. And I
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.680]   think the starting point for understanding that is that this
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.540]   writer Simon Schuster Time magazine wrote the in depth
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.620]   profile Zelensky four times person of the year at the end of
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:54.300]   2022. So this reporter cannot be accused of unfavorable
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.860]   coverage.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.580]   This is the person that profiled Zelensky as person of the year.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.320]   Yes, yes, exactly. Wow. So they so through that he probably had
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.440]   contacts in the lens keys inner circle and doing his
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.660]   preparatory work for that article.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.600]   Absolutely. Yeah, I've maintained those relationships
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.400]   and has a back channel now to be able to get this sort of
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.820]   insight.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.940]   Well, he was physically there. I mean, I think he was physically
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.880]   there to write the person that your profile and he was
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.320]   physically,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.340]   this isn't some like weirdly planted. This is like a legit
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:22.880]   source.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.280]   Well, that's my whole point is that this reporter is an entire
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.600]   magazine, obviously is mainstream media. And this
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.280]   writer has given favorable coverage to Zelensky in the
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.200]   past. And I believe that's what led to him having this kind of
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.060]   access to Zelensky is in our circle. Okay, you have to take
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.220]   all that into account.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.980]   The key question sexist does this change anything? So does
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.300]   this article change the sentiment of political leaders
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.900]   in the US? Or is nothing really different that we still need to
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.980]   defeat Putin continue to feed the war machine continue to
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.280]   support the effort against Putin? Or does this start to beg
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.980]   the question? Hey, maybe we need to look at this tactically and
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.060]   make a change. Is anything actually going to change from
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.760]   your reason to think that
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.780]   in a certain sense, this article isn't saying anything that's
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.600]   new. I mean, the article basically says the same things
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.120]   that I've been saying the same thing, the same kinds of things
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.320]   that Professor Mearsheimer has been saying Professor Jeffrey
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.720]   Sachs, that all the critics of this war have been saying these
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.160]   things for a number of months, which is the Russians are
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.240]   winning. There is no feasible way for the Ukrainians to evict
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.880]   the Russians from their territory. We are out of
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.960]   artillery and other types of ammunition to give them
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.480]   effectively, the war is unwinnable, we should negotiate.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.740]   So a lot of people have been saying that for a long time. But
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.820]   what's different now is that if you believe this publication in
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.720]   this writer, which I do because of his access, it's the
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.080]   linsky's own inner circle are now saying those same things. So
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.600]   in other words, the so called Putin talking points that we're
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.920]   always accused of are coming from inside the house. Yeah. And
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   to me, that's what makes this a Cronkite moment. Now, will
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.680]   policymakers in Washington change their tune or change
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.080]   their perspective on this? Probably not the unit party of
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.360]   both Republicans, Democrats are still seems to be a majority who
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.640]   want to fund another 61 billion for Ukraine. So is this
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.720]   penetrating the blob? I don't think so. I mean, but again,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.220]   think about Walter Cronkite in 1968, the country basically came
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.840]   around to his point of view after that, but it still took
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.540]   five years to get out of the Vietnam War. So I think that
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.440]   this week was a watershed in terms of the way that public
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.720]   perception is going to evolve over the next few months. But it
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.000]   seems like the policymakers in Washington are the last ones to
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.640]   get the memo.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.280]   Well, let's see what happens. I mean, I've shared my point of
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.680]   view for a couple years now, I think the US is in a call it
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.800]   subconscious conflict, escalatory state, that would
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.600]   continue to drive us into these sorts of it's great for market
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.720]   conflict seems to be great for markets. Conflict is great for
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.760]   markets, you're saying? No, no, no, no, the fact that it seems
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.880]   like there's a terminal outcome. And all we're debating is
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.920]   whether the Zelensky sees it is actually very reassuring for the
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.680]   market. Oh, you guys are markets, leaving the markets
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.360]   recognizing that there may be an end to the Ukraine conflict?
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.800]   Well, I do think I do. I do think in part, I don't think it
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.220]   explains why it's up necessarily today. I think that's more
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.400]   because I think I mentioned this before, but the end of the
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.680]   fiscal year for mutual funds was October 31. And so there was a
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.040]   lot of selling going into October 31, just to capitalize
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.880]   tax losses and tax loss harvest. But that leaves them with a lot
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.560]   of cash. And so starting November 1, which is day one of
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.480]   the new fiscal year, mutual funds are not allowed to really
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.120]   own cash, that's not why you pay them. And so they're going to be
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.320]   active buyers. So that's why in the short term, the market is
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.760]   up. But if you think about the overhang of risk that we've had,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.120]   right, you had one forever war. And now the beginning of what
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.440]   potentially could be another forever war, that's definitely a
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.240]   dampener on market demand, right, and, and, and sentiment
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.520]   and investor confidence. But if a story like this is true, it
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.320]   actually takes one of those big risks off the table, which is
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.840]   this idea that now, it's like every other kind of a thing,
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.120]   which is it's the reason we spend money there is not to win
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.600]   something that's winnable. It's just graph. It's just typical
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.280]   corruption. And the article says that the quarter Ukrainian
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.280]   officials saying that people are stealing like there's no
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.400]   tomorrow. Right? Right. So that that the US, unfortunately
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.840]   enables in many places, that's not new. And so to the extent
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.480]   that that's now more of the status quo, that's reassuring
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.400]   for investors, because we're not talking about a war, we're just
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.520]   talking about bleeding more money, which I'm not saying is
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.920]   right, but it's morally more acceptable than the alternative.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.120]   So there you have it. It's generally good for markets. Now,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:05.680]   that leaves, I think, Israel, Gaza has a risk. And I think
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.240]   people and I think the market still view that as a potential
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:16.440]   war. And the longer that goes on. I think that there's a very
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.280]   good chance that we de risk that as well as again, not a war, but
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.880]   part of that cycle between Israel and Palestine, which is
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.600]   conflict, timeout, conflict, timeout, conflict, timeout. And
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.480]   so if what we think is now this is just a version of conflict,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.320]   timeout, and the market de risks that then it's actually pretty
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.560]   positive for equities for startups. Because now the Fed
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.520]   has a reason to actually say, Okay, the economy is cooled off,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.160]   inflation is calm. It looks like the markets are stable. Let's
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.200]   cut rates, right? Let's, let's reintroduce some demand into the
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.280]   market. It's generally a good thing. And if there's no reason
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.880]   to be risk off, people will use that as a reason to be risk on.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:10.000]   Yeah, well, Treasury yields 30 the 30 year crack is, yeah, it's
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.480]   down. Correct. 40 minutes, two days. Yeah. So you think this is
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.280]   because the forecast or the outlook for q4 or q1 next year,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.760]   it's starting to go down quite a bit, that people are starting to
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.520]   see more recessionary indicators. So you think that's
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.720]   like peak 4.9% growth rate, and then inflation seems to be tame
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.520]   quite a bit too.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.960]   I think to be honest, the look through on q1 looks also pretty
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.080]   good. And q4 looks healthy as well. So for example, Shopify,
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   their read through on GDP was actually pretty healthy. Harley
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.480]   was on I think it was CNBC I saw this morning basically saying he
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.600]   thinks consumer spending is still strong, and it's still
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.200]   there. So I think in terms of just like economic strength, I
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.320]   think it's pretty decent, actually, I think what changed
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.000]   for the market was the feds rhetoric. And I think that they
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.240]   were holding on to this option that they were going to show up
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.880]   out of nowhere with another 25 or 50 basis point increase. And I
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.760]   think that that's fundamentally now off the table. And I think
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.680]   that that's really heartening for the market. That's good for
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:15.760]   the
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   market stocks are ripping a firm volunteer up 20% today,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.480]   ripping, ripping, ripping, open door, ripping, door dash,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.320]   ripping. All these companies are up 20 and 25 and 30%. It's
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.680]   crazy. Yeah. So are we calling bottom sex?
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.400]   Well, maybe I mean, I don't know, it's so hard to predict
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.880]   the markets. But if you believe that there's more upside to
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.440]   rates than downside, meaning that the odds of a rate
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.560]   decrease are much greater than the odds of a rate increase from
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.840]   here, then there is upside to valuations, particularly for
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.960]   gross stocks, also for distressed real estate, because
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.680]   all these things get more valuable when rates are lower.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.320]   So if you believe that we're going to be in our in a cycle of
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.560]   rate decreases, and that whole thing has played its way out,
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.760]   then everything's going to rally.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   Well, let's talk about real estate, because I think that's
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.720]   one of the biggest overhangs right now that hasn't fully been
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.960]   accounted for. There's, you know, $3 trillion of commercial
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.520]   real estate loans sitting out on commercial banks balance sheets
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.760]   in the US today, 3 trillion, it's an insane number. And we
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.560]   were all talking over text the other day, as you guys know,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.440]   about this building that's being shopped and got some attention
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.160]   on Twitter. I think the it's 115 Samsung, you guys know this
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.440]   building, I've lived in San Francisco for 20. How long have
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.600]   I lived there 20 some odd years now. So I know this building.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.040]   And it's 125,000 square foot building that's going to likely
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.080]   be fully vacant, and call it two to three years. So the guy puts
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.960]   it up for sale, the equity owner, he puts the building up
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.600]   for sale. And he's basically like running an auction on it.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.000]   And the brokers are all saying, Hey, it's currently at 199 bucks
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.600]   a square foot, which translates to $25 million, it'll probably
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.760]   get done at 300 bucks a square foot, which is about $38 million
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.600]   for the building. The problem is, if you look at the debt on
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   the building, there's 53 million of debt, B of A owns that note.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.000]   So Bank of America in 2016, issued a $54 million note on
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.280]   this building. If this deal closes at $39 million, the
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.720]   equity owner who's running this auction to sell the building
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.560]   makes $0. All that happens is that money pays down the debt,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.200]   and the debt only gets 70 cents on the dollar, and B of A has to
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.720]   take a write down on the rest. So there's a rumor that in this
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.440]   particular case, what's happening is the equity owner of
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.520]   the building is putting it up for auction to show the bank,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.080]   hey, this thing's only worth 70 cents on the dollar for you on
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.800]   your debt, you should restructure my debt. So
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.080]   apparently, there have been a lot of building owners that have
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.920]   been going to their banks and saying, Hey, I want to
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   restructure my note, I want to have longer payment terms, I
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.600]   want to keep the rates lower for longer, I want to have some of
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.840]   the debt forgiven anything they can do to get the cost of the
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.320]   debt down. Because the overhang of the debt on all these
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.080]   buildings is so significant, these buildings cannot make
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.120]   money and the owners will never make money. So they're like, why
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.040]   am I even wasting my time. So they have one option, which is
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   to hand the keys back to the bank and say, here you go, you
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.680]   auction it and sell it. Good luck. And the other option is to
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.480]   go to the bank and say, hey, restructure my debt, let's
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   figure out a deal. Here's the problem. The $3 trillion of debt
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440]   that we just mentioned that sitting on all the bank's
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.960]   balance sheets is all being held at par, they're not discounting
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.760]   it at all. And they're not marking it as being impaired in
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.480]   any way. So as soon as they have to start writing this stuff
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.160]   down, the bank's balance sheets all get impaired. And so there's
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.280]   a real risk in the market that I don't think has been fully
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.760]   accounted for that we're starting to see the cracks. And
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.600]   to Chema's point, this might accelerate either fed action, or
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.840]   as I've mentioned in the past, I think the federal government
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.720]   steps in and starts to issue programs to support commercial
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.920]   real estate developers and owners, sacks, I know you've
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.380]   been following this quite a bit, you know, maybe you could share
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.880]   your point of view. And if I'm off on this, in terms of how
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.860]   significant of a problem this is, you know, how much of the
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.520]   3 trillion of debt really is impaired? And by how much should
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   it be impaired? Do we think
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.760]   massively, I think it's a huge problem. If you talk to any
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.440]   body, any of these commercial real estate developers or
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.920]   sponsors, they'll tell you many of them are just kind of hanging
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.160]   on by their fingernails. I mean, it's really ugly. And you know
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.360]   how distressed things are when you actually look at some of
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   these sales, that same account on Twitter that you posted,
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.840]   he's got like a tweet storm here showing about half a dozen of
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.800]   these sales that have happened in the last few months. And
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.000]   buildings are now selling for two to $300 a square foot in San
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.560]   Francisco. These are buildings that could have sold for 1000
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.720]   bucks a foot, you know, a couple of years ago, and now
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   they're selling for two to 300. The replacement cost if you're
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.080]   trying to recreate these buildings from scratch, given
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.840]   how expensive it is to build in San Francisco, and how
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.200]   complicated the entitlements processes, probably be 1200 plus
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.400]   a foot. So these buildings are selling for 10 to 20% of their
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.760]   replacement cost. These are fire sales.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.960]   If you look at the loans in the in the San Francisco commercial
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.320]   real estate market, do you think that the loan value is probably
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.040]   impaired by 40%? Because that's roughly what it would say on
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.200]   that 115 Sansom building is B of A would probably have to take a
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.160]   30 40% markdown on their debt? Do you think that's the right
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   way to think about the numbers 30 to 40?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.360]   You could figure it out this way. A typical commercial real
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   estate deal is about one third equity and two thirds debt. So
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.680]   somebody bought a building at call it $1,000 a foot, they
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.400]   would have had to have put in call it 333 of equity 666 of
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.560]   debt. Yeah, now if that building is only worth, I don't know,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:53.040]   200 to 50 a foot, there's $750 of loss per foot, right? And
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.680]   only through 333, roughly half of it is equity. So the debt is
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.040]   taking a huge haircut there, too. Yeah, that's about 40 50%.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.240]   Right? Yeah. And no one wants to recognize that loss. The equity
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.760]   holders certainly don't because they get wiped out. And even the
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.880]   banks are reluctant to recognize that loss because who knows what
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.840]   that could trigger when their balance sheets are so impaired.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.880]   So what everyone's trying to people going to come from sucks
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.920]   where they were like, this is my this is my big problem with
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.680]   this argument is I, I think that numerically, you're right that
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.280]   there is this bottoming or there is just like a lot of value to
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.000]   be had, right? The problem is, and I'll get and I'll give you
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.840]   an example of a company that I own. So it's not even a company
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.720]   that I'm just a minority investor in. We used to be in
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.680]   San Francisco. And we went virtual. Now, all the salaries
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.240]   are pegged to San Francisco salaries. But now everybody's
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.720]   sort of like everywhere throughout the country, we don't
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.280]   have an office space. And I'm really struggling trying to
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.480]   figure out how to actually bring everybody together. And my
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.680]   choices were I thought, Okay, well, let me find what it would
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.360]   cost to actually run this place in San Francisco. And my, my
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   opex would have gone up 1520% just for the building. So then
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.520]   I'm like, Okay, well, where else can I go? And it's like, well, I
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.720]   could go to a place like Las Vegas, and I could put the
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.600]   people there. It's an hour, so it's close by, we can fly there
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.880]   whenever we need to. It's got no tax. So maybe that's an
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.200]   advantage for the employees. And so I'm in this constant hamster
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.280]   wheel as an owner of a business. I can't get people into the
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.400]   office. If I do bring them into the office, it's super expensive
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.280]   and it bloats my opex. So I'm just trying to figure out how
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.560]   does that get resolved for people like me so that we want
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   to go back to San Francisco and rent those buildings that are
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.920]   so cheap, those buildings are gonna have to get written down
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.760]   for. So I set up my company in 2006. I was paying $22 a square
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.000]   foot for my first office in a six. And then we ended up
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.960]   getting a really nice office. And I think we ended up paying
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.280]   like 35 to 40 bucks a square foot by the time we moved to a
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.800]   super nice office around 2010. But around that time, which was
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.480]   also when GFC happened the global financial crisis in a way
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.400]   to nine. And that's when rates dropped to zero. And that's also
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.080]   when all startups and tech companies said, Hey, let's start
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.440]   setting up in San Francisco, because it's mostly young people
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.040]   that are engineers. Now. They mostly want to live in the city.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.080]   They mostly want to be single and have a good life here
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.360]   rather than go live in suburban Silicon Valley. And so real
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.320]   estate shot up because rates were zero. All the tech
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   companies are setting I mean, sex you had Yammer in San
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.200]   Francisco, didn't you? Were you in the peninsula? Yeah. And that
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.240]   was like the place to have your company was in the city. And so
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.440]   I would argue like if you go back to the oh 809 era, that's
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.680]   really when San Francisco started to take off. And it was
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.280]   almost like a bit of an outlier of a bubble that started all the
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.960]   way back then. And then, you know, the ZURP environment kept
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.200]   things moving up and up and up over the years that followed. I
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.160]   do think that this like this market will likely normalize
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.240]   back to pre 2010 pre oh nine. And that's when rates were like
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.840]   in the 25 to 35 bucks a square foot range for you know,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.440]   I will move back to that building and I'll and I'll move
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.400]   my company back there when it gets repriced. Yes, I do think
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.680]   so. Are you sure? I don't see how I don't see how the market
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.640]   stays where it is. Yeah.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.520]   Tomas argument is basically on the demand side, basically
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.200]   saying, Where's all this demand going to come from?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.480]   I think you could give it to me for zero. And I wouldn't bring
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.280]   my team back there. I'm just asking like, again, the math all
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.760]   makes sense on a spreadsheet. But the big issue is, as an
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.800]   owner of a company, why would I ever bring my team back to that
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.000]   place? And I'm struggling even at like,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.960]   oh, you mean because it's a nasty city because it's all
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.640]   messed up the city's
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.000]   lost. First of all, what if you're if you're asking me to
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.880]   blow up my op x 10 20% the answer is absolutely not. Will I
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.160]   do that? Then if you're saying well, come on, how about a zero?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.480]   Let's just go to zero, right? It's right. Take the building.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.080]   Yeah, I still wouldn't do it because then these people have
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.440]   to move from all around the country come back here and all
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.120]   of a sudden just live in a slimy dungeon.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.080]   Yeah, how does that get solved? So that building should be zero.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.520]   Saks you own buildings in San Francisco. What's your answer as
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   a landlord?
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.880]   Yeah, I only own buildings in Jackson Square, which is like
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.160]   the one decent part remaining of San Francisco, which is actually
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.960]   where people want to be. And we've seen pretty good leasing
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.680]   activity there because it's as people get driven out of Market
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.000]   Street and out of Soma, they actually they substitute to
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.680]   Jackson Square. Look, I think your mouth makes a good point,
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.640]   which is the demand picture for San Francisco is really unclear.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.160]   There's something like, call it 30% vacancy. So there's an
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.240]   enormous number of these zombie buildings. And it's really hard
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.640]   to understand where the demand is going to come back to fill
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.000]   them. Now, the counter argument to that is, yeah, but it's so
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.160]   cheap. I mean, these buildings are so cheap. They're basically
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.280]   selling for almost land value.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.720]   That's the most point it's like, it goes to zero. Yeah.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.040]   So if there's a recovery, then it's very symmetric, right? I
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.840]   mean, you could get three or four x upside in your money very,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.760]   very quickly. rates come down over the next couple of years,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.320]   you could refire equity out. So that's the counter argument is
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.280]   Yeah, we're not exactly sure where the demands comes from.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.440]   But if you're are willing to have a long term outlook, like
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.960]   five or 10 years, then there's a pretty good chance that will
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.320]   come back somehow, I think one of the things that has to happen
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.440]   in order to foster that demand is for there to be some
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.160]   fundamental changes in the politics of the city. And the
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.400]   question is, how does that happen? And I think one of the
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.040]   ways it could happen is the city starts facing huge budget
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.200]   shortfalls, which are coming is there's going to be a huge
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.640]   budget shortfall over the next year and next couple of years,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.800]   because there's no activity. I mean, a third of the economic
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.720]   activity of the city is just dried up.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.480]   And what about the rest of the country? So tell me like, if
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.720]   this is what's happening in San Francisco, what's happening in
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.480]   Boston, Dallas, New York City?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   Well, I don't think those areas are as impaired. They don't have
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.840]   the vacancy rates that San Francisco does. I mean, so if
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   you look at the major market is 30%.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.520]   So just coming back to my prior question, if you were to assume
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.320]   San Francisco commercial real estate debt is impaired on the
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.160]   order of 30%. What do you think the debt load for the for all
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.360]   commercial real estate around the country is impaired? Is it
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.640]   10% 15% 20%?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.480]   I don't know. I mean, I think that you probably for San
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.000]   Francisco, I'd say probably half the debt should be written off.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.120]   I don't know what it is for the rest of the country. There's
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.600]   already half a dozen of these buildings that have traded in
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.760]   the range that we're talking about. And there'll be about 20
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.440]   more that are coming to market that will trade in the next
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.600]   year, it's going to be fire sale after fire sale. And you have to
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   clear out all of this bad equity. And then you've got to
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.320]   clear out all this bad debt and reset itself. So tomorrow has
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.000]   asked the, you know, 64,000 hour question here, which is, when
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.800]   will the demand come back? And what will it consist of? And
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   that is the leap of faith here that you have to make. Just to
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.840]   finish the point I was making, the city, the politicians are
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   going to be under extraordinary stress, because there's not
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.120]   gonna be any budget. So what are they going to do? Are they going
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   to lay off half the city employees reform, pensions and
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.560]   salaries? Or are they going to start to realize that all of
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.800]   their crazy transfer taxes, all of their crazy regulations and
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.320]   entitlements needs to be stripped away to start
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.600]   fostering real activity in the city? Are they going to start
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.120]   investing in police again? Are they going to start cleaning up
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.600]   the city? Are they going to act as a partner to business? I
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.640]   mean, that's where the incentives are going to be is
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.240]   for them to start acting like a partner again. And again, that's
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.560]   a huge leap of faith, given how crazy left wing the politics of
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.680]   services have been. But they may not have a choice, because it's
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.800]   going to come down to do we fire half the government employees?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   Or do we start working with business instead of driving them
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.480]   out of the city?
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.280]   I don't want to get too caught up in San Francisco politics in
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   San Francisco as a region. I think we've we've hashed that
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.400]   one out. But the bigger question is, if there's this impairment
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.440]   on $3 trillion of commercial real estate debt across the
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.800]   country, who eats the loss? So who owns all the equity in these
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.040]   buildings? And where does that ultimately flow through to what
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.720]   are the second order effects? And who owns the debt? And where
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   does that all flow through to we know the debt sits on the
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.600]   commercial banks? Do the bank stocks get beat up? The market's
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.760]   been cognizant of this folks have been shorting and selling
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.680]   regional bank stocks. And then Bill gross, the well known bond
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   trader used to run PIMCO came out this week, and said, Hey,
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.360]   I've been tracking all these regional bank stocks. They're
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.480]   down so much. It's insane. They're trading at a huge
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.000]   discount to book. I'm going to start buying and then this
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.160]   morning, he put out a tweet saying I'm buying these stocks.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.200]   And he listed the names of the bank stocks. He's like the
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.920]   bottoms been hit. Do you buy that? I mean, is this already
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.480]   been priced into the market, that this debt is going to be
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.360]   written off at some point and all these balance sheets are
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.120]   impaired? Because the banks are trading at a big discount the
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.800]   book value. So
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.600]   well, book value is a term that you need to put in quotes. So my
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   question would be what are the rules around the real mark to
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.600]   market? Because I think that when we talked about the banking
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.160]   crisis, the biggest problem was these guys were playing fast and
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.840]   loose with valuations. And so are these things actually valued
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.400]   to market? And do they have to?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.680]   They're not yet? No, that's the point. That's why they're trying
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.600]   to avoid these transactions. These book values are
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.400]   illegitimate. Yeah, and that's why they're trading at a
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.760]   discount. But Bill gross is now saying they're trading at such a
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.360]   discount to whatever the accounting is that they're like
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.480]   now well below the fair value.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.960]   Yeah, that's the argument for San Francisco real estate. I'm
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.840]   sorry that at least for these fire sales that are happening.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.920]   Yeah. Well, sex, let me ask you one more question. So I
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.640]   mentioned the Biden program, Biden announced this program,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.800]   which is effectively $45 billion in federal money to convert
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.200]   commercial buildings into condos and residential buildings. He
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.240]   basically relies on a 1998 transportation and
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.880]   infrastructure bill that provides authority to the
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.440]   federal government to issue low interest loans for specific
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.760]   infrastructure projects. If you're a developer, is it
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.480]   realistic that this money is going to unlock potential for
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.840]   increasing affordable housing density in urban centers by
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.040]   converting office buildings into residential buildings?
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.080]   People talk a lot about these office to residential
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.000]   conversions. The problem is, it's easy to say and much harder
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.040]   to do most commercial office buildings don't meet the
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.480]   structural requirements or architecturally, they're not
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.320]   really suitable. If you think about most commercial office
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.960]   buildings, they've got really big floor plates. And if you
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.120]   think about like restructuring them into apartments, there's
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.880]   not proper window coverage, there's not proper utilities. So
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.920]   it's a lot harder than it sounds. And I'd say most office
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.200]   buildings don't meet a lot of the requirements for this. But I
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.440]   think what's good about this executive order, even though I
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.040]   don't really believe this is a great use of 45 billion is that
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.320]   it's sending a signal to all of these cities, all these local
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   governments that we need to get with the program here. In other
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.680]   words, you've got, you know, a blue executive sending a message
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.880]   to all these blue cities and states, that commercial real
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.680]   estate is in distress, and you need to loosen up your
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.560]   entitlements, you need to loosen up your regulations. It's
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.720]   sending a message to the city of San Francisco and all these
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.320]   other cities that you guys need to start doing positive things.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.720]   And this is my point about will San Francisco start acting like
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.880]   a partner for real estate development, which is how you
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.520]   make real estate work? Or will they continue to drive all of
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.080]   these crazy regulations. So I mostly see this Biden program as
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.280]   symbolic, I say, but the question is whether the
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.360]   symbolism will actually drive better behavior by these blue
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   cities.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.400]   I personally think they're just trying to find more ways to pump
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   money into supporting commercial real estate markets because of
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.640]   the issues we just highlighted. And I think this is the first of
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   what will likely be several programs to support framed as
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.840]   things like affordable housing, but really designed to support
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.200]   the economic loss impairment. That's going to be inevitable at
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.960]   some point, right.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.720]   But you know, you can't you can't convert an office building
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.760]   to a residential building without reason. Yeah, typically,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.560]   totally. Yeah. And this is where you need action by the city
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.320]   governments. They've got to rezone, they've got to reduce
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.600]   the regulations, they've got to eliminate these transfer taxes
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.000]   have to make these projects. Yeah, exactly. They have to make
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.520]   these projects economically viable.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.040]   I think that we'll be able to look back in San Francisco will
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:21.840]   be an incredibly measurable experiment on the return on
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.320]   invested
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.360]   capital, so on the return on invested capital of progressive
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:33.760]   left ideology. And it will be a great case study. Now, if it
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.080]   works, it will prove that all of these ideas that were kind of
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:44.880]   talked about in kind of like high intellectual circles has
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.520]   some value. And if it fails, which it looks like it's
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.160]   failing, it'll never be tried again for a very long time.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.880]   Either way, you're going to have a very clear answer. And the
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.520]   good news is we're, we're probably another five or 10
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.040]   years away from that bottom.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.960]   Well, actually, guys, ask a quick question. So there was a
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.800]   article here saying that the city controller's office for San
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.600]   Francisco has released its projected budget shortfalls for
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.880]   the coming years. It's almost half a billion for 2024 25
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.720]   reaching 1.3 billion and 2728. So what do they do about this? I
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.920]   mean, they don't have the money, they'll borrow money.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.600]   And you can look at all of these other municipalities around the
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.400]   country as examples, but counties and municipalities and
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.800]   cities that are in much worse fiscal shape than San Francisco
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.040]   was able to stay incompetent for a lot longer. And so that delta
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.120]   T of incompetence tends to be about five to 10 years, I would
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.200]   say the midpoint is eight. So if we're starting now, you'll
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:54.120]   probably see some rationality by 2032 2033. That's how much
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.600]   borrowing David, I think you can tap in the in the muni market.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.560]   Because you know, again, this is sort of the the double edged
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.000]   sword, right? Like when you're a triple tax advantage borrower,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.120]   you can paint the case for being in San Francisco, which is part
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:12.360]   of California, etc, etc, etc. And your alternative is to own
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.880]   something in a state that's not nearly as economically vibrant,
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.280]   it's a pretty easy case to make to be able to borrow the money,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.080]   I think. And so the problem is that it'll take, like I said,
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.680]   another, probably eight years, 10 years, so before the the
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.240]   spigot gets turned off, and they have to make some harsh changes.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.160]   So they'll keep running this experiment for at least, I think
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.280]   if you want to be conservative for at least a decade, another
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.600]   decade,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.000]   so those pile on the debt until
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.880]   absolutely, I don't want to keep harping on San Francisco,
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.800]   let's let's move on to we work. Because we work feeds into this
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.920]   real estate piece. I don't know if you guys saw this article
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.560]   that Wall Street Journal reported that we work, it's
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.320]   going to file for chapter 11. As early as next week, they have a
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.200]   significant debt burden owed to SoftBank vision fund as part of
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.840]   their go public, they've signed leases in office buildings in
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.480]   San Francisco and elsewhere around the country $10 billion
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.040]   in total lease obligations due starting in the second half of
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.560]   2023, through the end of 27. And after that, an additional $15
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.880]   billion starting in 2028. And as of June, we work had 70 777
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.120]   locations, including 229 in the US in major cities, the business
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.320]   made about call it 840 million bucks in revenue last quarter.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.680]   So that works out to call it a three and a half billion dollar
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.480]   revenue run rate with you know, $10 billion of lease obligations
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.920]   starting next year. So the business is just drowning in
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.560]   these lease obligations and to restructure 777 lease
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.880]   obligations in this environment that we're talking about, while
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.360]   doing what you're saying, lowering rents to attract
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.160]   employers to show up and actually rent space from them
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.320]   is obviously causing the business model to distort even
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.560]   worse than it has been historically, they burned $8
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:01.080]   billion of pre cash flow in since q4 of 2019 $8 billion of
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.960]   free cash.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.400]   There's no question that that we work has been a capital
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.680]   destruction machine. That being said, I actually think that some
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.320]   private equity player is going to buy this out of bankruptcy
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   and make a fortune. I agree with that, too. Because out of those
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:22.000]   777 locations, a lot of them are good locations and have good
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.520]   tenancy, they probably generate good revenue. The problem is
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.240]   that the leases are just bad. And bankruptcy gives you the
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.080]   power to break those leases or renegotiate them. So a really
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.520]   smart private equity player would come in here and say,
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.600]   Okay, we're going to take these locations, we're going to buy
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.160]   them into three buckets. bucket number one is we're gonna get
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.720]   rid of them, because there's bad locations, we don't want them,
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.760]   there's just no occupancy. Bucket number two is we're gonna
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.680]   go to the landlord and say that, sorry, like this lease doesn't
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.000]   work for us, we will be willing to work for you as an operator
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.560]   of the space. And you'll pay us a fee and a rev share on
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   whatever it makes, but we can't pay you a guaranteed rent. So
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.080]   that's bucket number two. And then bucket three, which will be
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.600]   the best locations, they'll go back to the landlord and say,
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.360]   here's 60 cents on the dollar, we're willing to pay you this
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.520]   and rent. That's it. If that's not good enough for you, we're
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.080]   breaking the lease route. And those landlords are gonna have
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.480]   to accept it because we're gonna get who's any better. And they
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.420]   don't even have the TI is they don't have the capital to put
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.000]   some new tenant in there. And even if they could put someone
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.040]   in there, it's not gonna be at a rent that's much higher than 60
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.680]   cents on the dollar. Because we work made a lot of these top of
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.560]   market leases. So I think the landlord will take the bird in
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.800]   the hand. So think about it, some private equity player goes
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.580]   in there renegotiates all these leases, sheds the bad ones. And
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.600]   all of a sudden, the business is going to make a lot of money.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.400]   And the reason why it's going to make money is because we work
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.480]   poured all of this capital into renovating these spaces and
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.720]   making them really nice. I mean, if you go into a we work, they
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.760]   are really nice spaces. And the reason for that is because we
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.480]   work spent billions of ti dollars making these things
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.420]   incredibly nice. Was that a wise investment? No, it was a
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.800]   terrible investment. But that money has been spent and already
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.440]   lost that that capital has been wiped out. So whoever buys this
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.280]   thing out of bankruptcy now is gonna be the beneficiary of all
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.240]   of those absurd ti dollars that were spent. When Adam Newman,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.640]   oh my god, you just convinced me. Let's go buy it. Let's put
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.800]   it in a bid. Is it filed? Is it filed? The brilliance of Adam
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:32.040]   Newman was somehow convincing. Wow. All these investors to put
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.000]   in billions of dollars into ti money on the theory that it was
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.040]   a software business. This was never a software business. It's
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.920]   a real estate development company. It was Regis. It was
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:48.560]   really just as I got softbank put in a total of $16.9 billion
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.400]   in equity and debt. Oh my gosh, not incredible. Oh my gosh,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.280]   software, which is mostly through the vision fund, which
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.880]   is as you guys know, 45% Saudi money. It was Regis much better
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.540]   design, but that design came at a huge expense, which was again,
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.520]   this over investment in ti dollars, combined with the fact
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.560]   that they had no discipline around signing leases, and they
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.400]   have so many top of market lease deals. Yeah. But again, that's
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.040]   all fixable for someone who comes in old saying in real
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.720]   estate, that is the third owner who makes all the money. Like
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.600]   the first owner who does all the ground up, they lose a fortune
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.000]   and they get blown out. Then the second guy comes in and thinks
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.080]   that they're gonna make it work. But they can't make it work
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.960]   either. So then they get blown out. And it's finally the third
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.840]   person who comes in and makes all the money that's gonna
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.560]   happen here too.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.360]   Oh my god, that's just fantastic. This is a story of
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.160]   the ages. Let's transition from one bubble to the most recent
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.640]   bubble. So AI regulation, given the frenzy and froppiness and
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.440]   fear mongering on AI destroying the world, which I would
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.000]   personally argue is largely fear porn. The Biden
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.520]   administration took it upon themselves to try and be leaders
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.640]   in regulating AI and publish an executive order on October 30.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.840]   This long anticipated executive order covers a very broad range
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.080]   of matters and 111 page order document covers very specific
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.480]   actions in very detailed terms. It uses technical terms of art.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.040]   And I think it creates as much confusion as it does provide
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.440]   clarity. It's an executive order, so it's not legislation.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.200]   And there's much in here that some would argue needs to be
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.000]   legislated. As an executive order, it can be overturned very
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.720]   quickly and easily by the next administration. It largely
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.680]   demands voluntary action from technology companies to submit
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.520]   their models, infrastructure and tools for review. For proof of
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.280]   safety. Don't forget the equity and inclusion. There's an equity
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.720]   inclusion component, which is that your models have to account
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.760]   for diversity, equity and inclusion, diversity, equity,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.080]   inclusion, there's a phrase from the executive order, the term
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.560]   dual use foundational model means an AI model that is
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.840]   trained on broad data, generally uses self supervision contains
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.480]   at least 10s of billions of parameters is applicable across
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.200]   a wide range of contexts. And that exhibits high levels of
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   performance and tasks that pose a serious risk to security,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.720]   national economic security, public safety, or any
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.160]   combination of those matters, none of which ultimately
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.240]   describes endpoints, none of which describes loss, or
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   applications. To me, this is the biggest problem I see with the
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.760]   executive order and with the approach to AI regulation
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.480]   broadly, particularly with what's being developed and has
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.960]   been leaked in terms of what's being developed out of the EU,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.600]   which is that many of these government agencies, government
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.640]   actors are trying to define and regulate systems and methods,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.600]   rather than regulate outcomes and applications. For example,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.280]   if you were to say you cannot commit fraud, and falsely
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.840]   impersonate someone using software, you can rightly say
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.920]   that it follows the rule of law. And we should be able to
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.680]   adjudicate that cleanly in courts. Instead, to have
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.280]   government agencies and have what this executive order
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.560]   describes as a chief AI officer in every federal agency,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.440]   responsible for regulating the systems and methods of all the
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.560]   actors and all the private companies that are building
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:20.000]   software to say this is the scale that your software can get
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.720]   to, you can have a certain number of parameters. If you're
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.600]   bigger than this number of parameters, we have to come in
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.000]   and check your software creates an outlandish standard. And one
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.760]   that makes absolutely no sense, particularly in the context of
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.240]   the pace of AI is progression. Remember, the paper that was
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.040]   foundational to transformer model development, which is what
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.800]   a lot of people call AI today, which is developed these LLM and
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.200]   so on, came out in 2017, and wasn't really widely adopted
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.920]   until 2018. As a standard, we're five years into this. So the way
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.160]   that we're making models, the types of models we're building
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.640]   the scale of the models, the number of parameters being used,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.720]   the pace at which these things is changing is staggering. We
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.680]   are only in the first inning. And so to come out and say, here
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.400]   are the standards by which we want to now regulate you. This
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.000]   is the size that the model can be these are the types of models.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.800]   It's going to look like medieval literature in three years, none
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.200]   of this stuff's even going to apply anymore. I'm just really
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.120]   of the point of view, as you guys know, that the market needs
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.960]   to be allowed to develop. If we don't allow our market to
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.200]   develop in the United States, India, and China, and Singapore,
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.080]   and other markets will get well ahead of us in terms of their
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.440]   model development and their capabilities as a nation and
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.360]   their capabilities as an industry. And the more our
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.560]   government actors step in and try and tell us what systems and
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.960]   methods we are allowed to use to build stuff, the more at risk we
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.920]   are falling behind. That's my general statement on the matter.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.120]   I'll pass the the mic. I mean, to mock you were advocating for
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.000]   AI regs a couple months ago, I think, right? I mean, where does
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.360]   this fall with respect to what you were advocating for and what
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.240]   you were concerned about?
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:59.080]   Well, I had a very specific lens that I viewed this stuff through
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.840]   and they didn't really address it. I think that this was a
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:08.320]   little bit of a kitchen sink yo. And I think what probably
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.400]   happened was depending on look, I mean, I think the thing is
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.560]   like, look, they when this process first started, it
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   started in the Senate and we started with the majority leader
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.520]   Chuck Schumer. And I met with Chuck and then I met with Chuck's
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.480]   team. And then it morphed into this much bigger thing. And I
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.920]   think it morphed into a lot of people trying to do the right
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.400]   thing, meeting with a lot of very important and very famous
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.720]   people. And I think somewhere along the way, it just became
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:45.320]   this convoluted and confused document, because I do agree
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.680]   with you that it's not super coherent. There's a lot of
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.040]   arbitrary requirements, you know, like there's like, I think
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.080]   there's a requirement here that as a certain number of
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.840]   parameters, you have to like self report yourself to the
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.880]   government, which is like, what does that even mean? Why? Why is
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.520]   that even important? So it's just a lot of random stuff. So
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.560]   it just seems like anybody who had the ear of the people
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.000]   writing this had a chance to write something in. So it's a
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.800]   little confusing. It's not going to do the job. And I think that
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.880]   you're right, two or three years, we're going to look back
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.240]   and this is going to look medieval.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.600]   I'll just say I'll point out another point, just one of many
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.920]   that I could highlight in this document, I read most of it.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.720]   They say, you know, there's got to be legislation on water
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.000]   marking AI content. Think about that for a second. What is AI
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.720]   content? We've been using Adobe Photoshop for 30 years, to
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.840]   change photographs and change documents. We've been using
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.080]   various tools for doing audio generation and music. I mean,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.520]   there's no music that doesn't run through a digital processor
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.920]   of some sort. There's no video. There's no movies that don't
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.320]   have some degree of CGI elements or some degree of post
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.960]   production, digital rendering integrated into the video
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:05.680]   itself. What makes something AI? Is it the fact that 100% of the
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.240]   pixels are generated by software? What if it's only 98%
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.840]   is Pixar AI, because all of Pixar is made on computers? Is
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.560]   the auto tune hip hop artist AI, because his voice isn't coming
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.320]   through on the audio track? So what is AI in this definition,
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.800]   the fact that any piece of content needs to be watermarked
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.960]   if it's AI, I think is one of the most outlandish infringements
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.520]   on First Amendment rights I've seen, and doesn't really
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.720]   understand any set in any sense, how software is generally used
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.640]   in the world today, which is frankly everywhere. And to say
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.040]   that now there is a certain definition of a certain type of
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.520]   software that we're going to arbitrarily call AI, we want to
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.560]   watermark this stuff, and we want to get a stamp on that
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.440]   content. So the government can track it and audit it, I think
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.800]   is absurd. tax over to you.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.080]   Yeah, okay, three, three quick points here. And number one, AI
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.400]   has been convicted of a pre crime. This, this EO, it
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.520]   describes it describes this litany of horribles, this parade
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.200]   of horribles, that's going to happen. Unless you know, the
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.840]   wise people in the central government, like Joe Biden,
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.480]   Kamala Harris, guide its development. So that's what the
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.080]   EO says can do is guide the development of this technology.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.480]   Because if we don't, it's going to result in all these horrible
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.800]   things happening. Steven Sanofsky, who was a key
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.600]   executive of Microsoft in the I think it going back to the 80s,
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.120]   wrote a really interesting blog post about this, where he was
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.760]   there at the beginning of the PC revolution, with the dawn of the
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.340]   microprocessor in the 70s and 80s. Yeah. And he pulled a bunch
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.340]   of books off his bookshelf from that time period, which were
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.240]   sort of the sci fi books like forecasting doom infringement on
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.420]   privacy, one was called the assault on privacy, and it was
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.440]   called electronic nightmare. Another one was called the rise
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.900]   of the computer state, and so on. And so it was also predicting
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.900]   all these horrible things that would come from the birth of the
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.740]   computer. And it would put all these people out of work and so
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:11.040]   on. Totally. But nobody allowed these fears to guide the
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.740]   development of the industry. There was no executive order at
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.820]   that time, saying that we're going to guide the development
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.060]   of the microprocessor processor to avoid all these harms that
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.420]   haven't occurred yet. And instead, we're taking a
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.420]   different approach here. And he makes the point that if the
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.260]   industry had been guided in that way, then it never would have
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.640]   achieved the potential that it ultimately achieved. And
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.380]   furthermore, he makes the point that a company like IBM would
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.220]   have been more than happy to work with the regulators to say,
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.340]   yeah, let's define a bunch of these rules to make sure that it
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.140]   doesn't go in this dark direction that everyone thinks
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.420]   it's going to go in. And I would have gotten very extreme
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   regulatory capture.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.460]   Can I pre cog one of the crazy lines in this thing? Here are
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:55.540]   the pre cogs. What here's one when a foreign person transacts
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.300]   with an infrastructure as a service provider. So as your
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.600]   Google Cloud Amazon, to train a large AI model with potential
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.240]   capable with potential capabilities that could be used
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.060]   in malicious cyber enabled activity, they propose
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   regulation that requires that I asked provider to submit a
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:23.280]   report. So if you have to, if a foreigner is using your API, so
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:30.460]   AWS, file a TPS report, what is going on? I have a clarifying
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.600]   question. What happens if you're a foreigner that's on an h1 b at
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.340]   Facebook or, you know, Microsoft? Well, technically a
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.780]   foreigner, right? And then Chamath Meanwhile, remember when
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.580]   SpaceX is now being sued by the DOJ because they haven't employed
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:52.940]   enough foreigners. So it's like, outlawed both sides of it. You're
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.660]   in non compliance just by existing.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:05.220]   By death. If you employ foreigners in the creation of
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.220]   these very sophisticated technologies, you're creating a
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.560]   national security threat. If you exclude them, you're violating
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.480]   their civil rights. And these are regulations are promulgated
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.360]   by two different parts of the government. So the government is
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.160]   basically getting to a point where no matter which side of
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.280]   the regulation you choose, you're going to be a non
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.660]   compliance somewhere. And this is just a recipe for the
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.400]   government to basically take action against anybody who they
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.600]   don't like politically. Yeah. Now in this pre crime point, you
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.560]   know, one of the crazier stories that came out, and I think this
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.280]   was in variety, is that Biden grew more concerned about AI
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.800]   after screening the most recent Mission Impossible movie, which
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.040]   the villain is a sentient AI that seizes control of the
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.640]   world's intelligence apparatus. Is that true? That's not true.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.120]   Well, that's what the story said.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.280]   Didn't the press reporter asked the press secretary this and
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.920]   this was the response. Who said this?
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.320]   The chief of staff, I guess said read said read who? Yeah, wow.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.560]   Unbelievable. The crazy thing is that I think the reason they're
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.200]   putting out this story is they don't want to admit how the EO
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.680]   really happened, which is a bunch of lobbyists came in. And
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.280]   like you said, a lot of powerful people from big tech, they're
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.600]   all clamoring for regulatory capture, they're all clamoring
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.800]   to define the regulations so that they can benefit themselves
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.680]   and keep out new entrants. Because one of the big targets
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.120]   here is going to be open source software. So if you are, for
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.120]   example, open AI, which is no longer open as closed source,
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.040]   the number one thing you want to do is pull up the ladder before
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.440]   open source software can get a lot of momentum. And a big part
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.320]   of the regulation here does apply to open source software. I
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.920]   think one of the most problematic things about this
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.880]   just to move on to the next point is the way that it's not
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.880]   just this 110 page EO that's being promulgated. The
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.320]   directive is for all these other parts of the federal government
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.160]   to start creating their own regulations. So it says here
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.840]   that the National Institute of Standards and Technology will
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.320]   develop standards for red team testing of these models. It
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.480]   directs the Department of Commerce to develop standards
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.280]   for like you said, freeberg labeling AI generated content
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:13.320]   directs explicitly the FTC to use existing leg regulation to
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:19.360]   go and legislate it, it requires the FCC to think about spectrum
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.320]   licensing rules. Through this lens, you're absolutely right,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.760]   it activates every agency of the government to create more
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.520]   bureaucracy,
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.640]   create more importantly, it creates authority for agencies
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.920]   of the government to go into private servers and run audits.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.600]   You're allowing the government for the first time ever to have
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.960]   access to private information, private computing
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.120]   infrastructure, rather than do what the job of the government
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.000]   should be, which is to regulate the outputs to regulate the
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.640]   outcomes to regulate illegal and illicit activities, rather than
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.680]   regulate systems and methods that as sacks point out are
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.800]   pre convicted of a crime, there is no crime until a crime is
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.000]   committed. And so this idea that the government can come in and
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.040]   regulate and keep a crime from being committed by auditing,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.360]   managing all the systems and methods that software companies
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.600]   are using puts the United States is at an extraordinary and unfair
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.560]   disadvantage on a global stage, by the way. And by the way,
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.160]   llama two is out there. Hardware is out there. All the tooling is
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.400]   out there for others to start to get well ahead.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.760]   Good news about the immigration thing. There is they actually on
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.600]   the other side do streamline the immigration process for people
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.440]   with AI or other critical technologies. So on the one
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.960]   hand, we should be able to hire them. But then on the back end,
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.200]   we'll have to file a TPS report about what they do.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.560]   We just finished my point about different agencies being
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.840]   directed now to promulgate regulations. And by the way,
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.240]   there's some new committee or council that's being created of
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.680]   29 different parts of the federal government that are now
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.520]   going to coordinate on this AI stuff. So it's going to be a
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.520]   Brussels style bureaucracy. What's going to happen is that
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.920]   with all of these different bodies issuing new regulations,
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.520]   it's going to get more and more burdensome on technology
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.480]   companies until the point where they cry out for some sort of
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.080]   rationalization of this regime, they're going to say, Listen, we
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.200]   can't keep up with FCC and Department of Commerce and this
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.560]   and it standards board, just give us one agency to deal with.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.240]   And so the industry itself is eventually going to cry uncle and
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.320]   say, like, please just give us one and you're ready here. People
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   like Sam Altman and so forth, calling for the equivalent of
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.040]   Atomic Energy Commission for AI. This is how we're going to end
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.760]   up with a federal software commission, just like we have a
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.520]   FCC to run big communications, and we have a FDA to run big
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.400]   pharma, we're going to end up with a federal software
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.200]   commission to run software, big software. And the thing to
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.040]   realize about AI is that functionally, there's no way to
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.200]   really say what the differences between AI and software in
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.560]   general, every single technology company, it's looking Valley has
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.160]   AI on its roadmap, it's a new computing paradigm, everybody is
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.560]   incorporating it, everyone is using some elements of AI. So
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.440]   this wave of AI is just becoming software. So we're going to take
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.080]   the one part of our economy that has been free market and
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.160]   relatively unregulated, which is software, it's like the last
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.120]   bastion of true entrepreneurial capitalism, and we're going to
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.600]   create a new federal agency to manage it. That's where we're
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.560]   all headed here. And we're going to end up as an industry in the
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.920]   same place that pharma has ended up or no telecom has ended up,
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   which is you go for permission to Washington.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.080]   No, I Nick, can you just put this up? So I, I did, you know,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.000]   write a blog post sort of asking for this AI regulation. And, and
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.520]   I do think like the model of the FDA is probably the best one
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.320]   where in certain use cases, I do think that you can create a
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.200]   sandbox where these things can be tested, and I think can be
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   evaluated. The problem is that this legislation or this
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   executive order doesn't really do that. So the way that I wrote
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.000]   this was, well, what are the arguments against what I'm
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.320]   proposing? And unfortunately, I have to say every single one of
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:24.440]   those arguments is not valid. So I think that we should have gone
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.960]   in the direction of like a simplifying assumption, which is
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.720]   that most of this stuff is just software. And there are going to
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.920]   be some very specific kinds of businesses that before you take
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.080]   it to market, you should do something that's equivalent to
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.600]   sticking it in a sandbox, letting people see it. And I
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.400]   think it's easy to define what those are actually. And the fact
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.080]   that we didn't do that, and we have this overly generalized
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.280]   approach is going to create more chaos and people will not know
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.600]   whether they're in violation or they're in support, they're
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.480]   going to be sort of pre guilty, as you said, sacks of a pre
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.360]   crime. It's just gonna, it's just gonna be chaos. So I think
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.760]   this is a smorgasbord for politicians, because everyone's
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.400]   gonna be lobbying them to try and shape the regulations the
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.680]   way they want. I think it's going to be a smorgasbord for
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.240]   lawyers. Yeah, I mean, everyone's gonna hire lawyers
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.200]   and lobbyists and policy people to try and shape these
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:16.840]   regulations.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.480]   Good time to bet on India. Thank God for Mark Zuckerberg and the
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.920]   open sourcing of the llama to model.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.040]   It's not entirely open source, right? I mean, I think the
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.680]   biggest thing with llama to that I find problematic is that it
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.560]   has these arbitrary arbitrary thresholds on the number of
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.040]   users one can have. Yes, yes. Before you have to go back to
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.400]   Facebook. So yeah, it's 700 million, I think, right? Yeah.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.520]   Yeah. Before I give all the credit to Facebook, I'd rather
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.160]   say that I think there are a lot of open source alternatives,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.000]   including Mistral that I think are much better. Yeah. And free
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.280]   and open and in the clear where you can have unencumbered
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.760]   growth, not dependent on anybody else.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.840]   Yeah, yeah. But I think your freeware, your larger point
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.800]   about us versus India versus China. I think this could have a
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.720]   major impact on our global competitiveness, of course,
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.840]   because as you look around the what's happening in the American
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.680]   system, there are so many things going wrong, right? Our fiscal
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.560]   situation is untenable. We're mired in massive debt. We have
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.760]   tremendous internal division in the country. Many of our cities
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.040]   are rife with crime, you just look at the number of people
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.160]   living on the streets. It's not good. I mean, you know, there's
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.200]   a lot of indicators that America's in decline, we're
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.480]   involved in way too many foreign wars. So there's a lot of bad
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.040]   things happening. However, the one bright spot that America has
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.640]   had going for it now, I think for decades is that we've always
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.080]   been the leader in new technology development. I mean,
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.840]   we're the ones who pioneered the internet. We're the place where
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.400]   mobile took off, we're the place where the cloud took off, and
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.920]   everyone else has been playing catch up with that. And I think
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   we are in the lead in terms of AI development. I mean, other
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.040]   countries are doing it too. But I think that we are in the lead.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.080]   And it's not because of the involvement of government. It's
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:00.280]   because we have this vibrant private sector that's willing to
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.240]   invest risk capital, where you know that nine out of 10 checks
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.800]   that you write are going to zero, but that one check that one
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.280]   out of 10, hopefully, could be a huge outcome. So we've had this
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.160]   incredible ecosystem of software development that is free and
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.520]   unregulated that is clustered around Silicon Valley, but it
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.600]   radiates out to many other places. And the only reason that
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.120]   ecosystem has thrived and survived is the reason that Bill
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.240]   Gurley stated at all on summit, which is it was 2200 miles away
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.560]   from Washington, and Washington has generally kept its mitts
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.680]   off. And now we are headed to a place where not just AI, but
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.640]   basically all software companies are headed for regulation. And
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.480]   like I said, right now, it's 29 different agencies promulgating
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.160]   the regulations. But where this is going to end up is that the
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.960]   industry is eventually going to beg for its own agency just to
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.280]   rationalize all the spaghetti of different regulations, we are
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.840]   eventually going to beg for our federal agency overlord, just to
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.600]   rationalize this whole mess. And sadly, I think that's where we're
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.840]   going to end up and a lot of what is special about our
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.480]   industry, which is that two guys in a garage really can get
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.680]   started in a completely permissionless way. I think
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.760]   that's going to be jeopardized.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.600]   If that's the endgame. That's genius.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.800]   I think that is the endgame.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.360]   I mean, do you think that they wrote this thing in a way just
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.680]   to create enough confusion where we all just cry uncle and say,
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.720]   just regulate us? Give us? Yeah,
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.120]   look, I don't know if it's that conscious. I think what it is,
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.560]   is there's a lot of politicians in Washington, and Biden and
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.960]   Harris definitely fall into this category, who just think that
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.200]   central planning or the central guiding of the economy or
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.440]   aspects of the economy to avoid certain problems that they think
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.680]   they can do this, they think that they are wise enough to do
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.480]   this. Or maybe they're cynical, and they just know this a
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.440]   pathway to campaign contributions. But either way,
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.880]   they kind of believe in this approach. And they threw the
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.560]   kitchen sink at this 110 pages. Every agency is not gonna be
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.080]   writing 1000s of pages. And I think where it's going to end up
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.160]   is with a new agency to manage software.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.160]   So I think, Saks, it's a, the point you're making is one that
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.080]   some folks in Silicon Valley have felt for a while, which
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.480]   that is that a lot of the freedom and opportunity that the
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.600]   United States offers pioneers and entrepreneurs has been
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.720]   realized and born out in Silicon Valley, that's feeling like it's
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.200]   been stymied in a number of ways. But the events in Israel
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.720]   couple weeks ago, in my opinion, seems to have shocked a lot of
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.960]   people that are traditionally very liberal Democrats into
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.840]   being red pilled. I have had a number of calls with individuals
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.040]   over the last few weeks that have historically been very
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.920]   diehard blue liberal Democrats have spent their, their time
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.360]   with NGOs with nonprofits with various efforts to promote
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.600]   liberal causes. And these are folks who may or may not be
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:12.680]   Jewish, but who have been so shocked by what's happened in
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:18.320]   Israel, and how many liberal organizations have created this
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.240]   narrative around being pro Palestinian, in a way that is
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.840]   being deemed, and is coming across as highly, and in many
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.360]   cases is very much anti semitic. And so I've had folks say, I'm
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.640]   giving up everything else I'm doing. And all I'm going to do
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.200]   is change the causes I'm working on now. And I have just been red
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.880]   pilled. Do you guys and Shamak, you shared your story on our
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.920]   show a couple of weeks ago, the clip of you saying that went
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.080]   viral on how you kind of recognize that maybe Trump was a
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.000]   good president in the context of what you're experiencing with
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.840]   the Biden administration. Now we're seeing with the Biden
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.600]   administration. Now, you seem to be like, the case study that
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.040]   I'm now hearing more from Silicon Valley folks. Yeah,
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.960]   about this mission.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:09.200]   I think that over the last three or four years, my political
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.440]   positions really haven't changed that much. But I think what's
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.240]   happened is that the the political party that I've
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.520]   historically been affiliated with has just kept lurching
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   further and further to the left. And so it leaves me looking for
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:33.880]   a new home, I think. And I think that there are a lot of people
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.320]   that thought they were signing up for a set of beliefs around
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.960]   free speech around being pro reproductive rights around being
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.200]   supportive of LGBTQ issues, but also supportive of a rational
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.360]   approach to the border and reasonable fiscal discipline.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   These are all seem to just be totally out the window. So I
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.880]   understand because I've actually talked to a lot of my friends
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.240]   and my friends, some of them have been huge donors to both
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.320]   elite colleges and the Democratic Party. And they've
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.160]   paused all of it. And it's definitely given me pause. And
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.840]   I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here. Because I
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.360]   think the reality is that this is a really crazy situation. So I
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.440]   think that there's just a lot of people that are in the center
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.760]   that don't really belong anymore, the way that the
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.080]   Democrats represent themselves. So there's clearly something
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.200]   going on that we just need to get to the bottom of here,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.120]   because I think it's not probably the Democratic Party
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.760]   that a lot of people thought that they belong to.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.120]   Do you have other friends and folks that you know, that have
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.600]   traditionally been democrat donors and Silicon Valley
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.080]   Chamath that you see are now maybe considering shifting where
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.760]   they're giving money to Republican Party candidates and
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.240]   causes?
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.680]   I think it's easy to say that amongst my friends, it's in the
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.640]   billions of dollars that's been paused. That's insane. That's a
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.160]   lot of money.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.200]   Actually, you used to be part of a niche in Silicon Valley,
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.120]   Silicon Valley, Republican niche. Is your niche growing?
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.680]   I think so. I actually made a list of I think eight issues
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.560]   that have driven the shift. And when you say there's been a
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.960]   shift, right, I wouldn't say that there's been a shift all
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.040]   the way to the right. But I think there's been a shift from
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.920]   the left to the center.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.320]   By the way, that statement is consistent with what I've heard
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.560]   personally from a lot of folks, which is I consider myself a
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.000]   centrist. Now that I see that some of these liberal causes are
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.240]   so they're extreme from my point of view,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.320]   right. So let me rattle off what I think the key drivers are
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.400]   number one, reckless fiscal monetary policies coming out of
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.840]   Washington, as Druckenmiller says, we've been spending like
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.520]   drunken sailors. Number two, the dismal state of San Francisco
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.560]   because of crime, drugs, homelessness, and so on. And we
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.960]   all know that's an extreme one party government. Number three,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.560]   the ruinous COVID policies, they botched the science, they harmed
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.560]   the educational development of kids. And they also harmed work
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.400]   culture by making employees feel permanently entitled to work
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.000]   from home. So that's number three. Number four, this long
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.840]   kind of regulatory capture in both Washington, Sacramento that
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.400]   we just talked about with AI, people are waking up to that.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.600]   Number five, the betrayal of true liberal values, like free
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.600]   speech and open inquiry. Number six, the way that tech
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.640]   visionaries like Elon have been targeted for harassment by left
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.160]   wing politicians. Remember, Biden said we need to look into
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.000]   this guy. Well, Reina Gonzalez was even less subtle. She said
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.360]   simply Elon Musk, number seven, the growing awareness that
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.320]   wokeness has gone way off the rails. We saw this even before
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.920]   the Israel Hamas war. But now I would say number eight is this
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.120]   war, it's really thrown gasoline on the fire by showing that
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.480]   wokeness leads to the simplistic breaking up of the world into
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.240]   oppressor and oppressed categories. And what we're
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.440]   seeing is that there's a lot of people in the woke left who are
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.600]   basically cheering for a terrorist organization. And
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.680]   they're able to rationalize atrocities because of this
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.200]   simplistic woke dichotomy. That being said, I do think it's
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.120]   possible to support the desire for a Palestinian state and a
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.840]   two state solution without falling into that bucket. I want
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.560]   to be clear about that. But I think that there's been way too
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.360]   many people on the woke left, who have blithely disregarded
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.560]   the atrocities and were basically cheering for Hamas
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.040]   from day one on this thing. And I think that has woken up a lot
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.640]   of liberals, both Jews and non Jews who saw Jews as allies on
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.760]   the left. And when they see Jews being attacked this way, that
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.280]   has led them to really, I think, question their their priors on
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:41.600]   this.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   What did you think of the Kamala Harris announcement
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.880]   yesterday that they're launching a program to combat Islamophobia
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.560]   in the US at a time when my understanding is many of their
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.840]   Jewish donors are up in arms about their lack of action on
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.920]   anti semitism. I mean, it just
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.080]   It just seems tone deaf. I mean, look, I have not seen in this
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.800]   particular case, I don't think I've really seen outpourings of
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.440]   Islamophobia. To be clear, I'm against Islamophobia. I'm
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.880]   against hatred towards any particular group, including
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   Muslims or Jews to me, you know, any outpouring of hate towards a
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.040]   particular group is bad. But yeah, this seems like a problem
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.520]   that we really haven't seen. So it seems a little bit tone deaf.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.600]   And look, this administration has been kind of stumbling
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.960]   around on on this whole issue. It seems like they don't really
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.560]   know what to do.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.200]   I don't know how to quantify it. I just think it's an anecdote.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.280]   What do you know, I like I'm saying, I don't know how to
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.320]   quantify it. But I think that the anecdote is a lot of folks
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   know what, what do you think? What do you feel?
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:50.520]   What do I feel? Yeah. I mean, I'm not a party guy. Taking a
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.320]   step back, this is getting a gonna get a little esoteric. But
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.920]   I think humans organize into social systems. One social
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.000]   system is a family one is a company. And I think that the
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.800]   government is a social system. The point of a social system is
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.680]   to get influence to achieve the things you want to achieve by
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.520]   aggregating together by creating a tribe by creating a system.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.280]   And that's what a government is. It lets a lot of people pull
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.800]   resources to get things done as a group that you wouldn't
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.040]   otherwise be able to get done individually. Same with a
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.800]   company, same with a family to support each other, etc. And I
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.280]   think that the problem with democratically elected
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.160]   governments, or all governments for that matter, frankly, is like
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   any other system. They and I've said this in the past, they have
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.400]   a natural incentive to grow. I met with a government person the
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.440]   other day, well known government person. And I was struck by the
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.840]   the tone. I've been struck by the tone on multiple people I've
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.720]   met from the government on here's all the next things I'm
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.440]   going to get done. And here's how we're going to grow and do
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.000]   more and be bigger. Just like if you're running a company, that's
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.240]   your incentive. That's your model of thinking. And like with
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.000]   your family, you want to grow the balance sheet for your
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.240]   family, you want to have another home you want to take care of,
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.480]   you want to build security, etc. So governments as an
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.840]   organizing system are no different. And so I think that
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:17.200]   in a democracy, over time, there is, as Saks points out, a group
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.840]   of folks who get elected, and as a result, like a philosophy that
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.960]   endures in that system, that is all about overcoming the power
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   that is that we all view there to be powers that are keeping us
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.200]   from doing the things we want to do. And I think that this is the
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.920]   ultimate manifestation of what happens is that you push the
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.120]   government to be as big as possible, with no end. And you
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.880]   push the government to destroy any system of power that gets in
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.000]   the way of those who are able to vote these folks in. And now a
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.080]   lot of folks who thought that they were supporting liberal
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.200]   causes to help those in need, are realizing that you're
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.960]   actually repressing minorities in the process that there are
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.800]   minorities that are viewed to be powerful, like Jews, that there
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.840]   are minorities that are viewed to be unfairly advantaged, like
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.800]   those in the tech industry, that there are minorities who are
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.040]   viewed to be unfairly advantaged, like billionaires. And
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.800]   I know that this sounds insane to say that those terms, but
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   that's the objective is to destroy any system of power, any
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.240]   individual of power that has any form of leverage over us. It's
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.840]   also why I think we've generally been techno pessimistic in the
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:29.680]   West since the late 1960s, early 70s, is because technology has
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.120]   been viewed as this point of leverage for creating a power
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.560]   system for a minority of the people. So I generally view this
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.360]   as part of a longer arc and a natural kind of conclusion to
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.520]   this stuff. And you know, I'm not trying to be super
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.400]   pessimistic about where things are going, because I do see that
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.360]   the a lot of folks are now waking up to this reality. And
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.520]   they're like, so my anecdote is, I've had a lot of folks tell me
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.320]   in the last couple weeks, we have to be thoughtful about how
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.760]   we elect and how we govern, so that we create a more balanced.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.120]   So what's the end? What's the end game in your framework? My
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.600]   end game is socialism. I think that's where things go,
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.480]   ultimately, long term, I think that there's a recapturing and
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.520]   redistribution of power and value, I think that there's some
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.480]   degradation of the system that erodes to looking like something
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.240]   like France, it's not like a nasty, and it's like a slow
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.840]   whimpering, like you end up looking like France or
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.160]   something. And so that's my end game in that framework. And I
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.520]   believe strongly, this is why we talked about this with Dahlia,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.960]   that there are political actions, decisions, voting
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.440]   mechanisms that that hopefully we can put in the place to stall
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.600]   out and to stop that from happening. Because I do think
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.040]   that human progress is critical for the minor for the majority
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.320]   of people that are disadvantaged. So we need to
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:40.760]   enable it.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.120]   Okay, so I'm guessing you're on the I don't want to be France
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.760]   side.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.520]   100%. That's right. Okay, so and so what is the I want to be the
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.920]   Wild West, I want to be the 19th, the early 19th century,
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.240]   what do you think that we should do in America right now? I think
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.320]   we should unwind a lot of laws. And I think we should have as a
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.440]   mandate, the objective is, how do we get more of our economy
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.600]   and more of our people in this country to be supported by and
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.240]   progress through private industry, rather than public
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.680]   support, the federal government and the role that the federal
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.560]   government has in funding industry and hiring individuals
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.960]   in pumping dollars into markets, I think has gotten so far beyond
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.280]   the tell, that we, as we know, are being sloshed back and
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.600]   forth based on the decisions being made by the Federal
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.760]   Reserve. That should have never been the case. The free market
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.440]   should have always been allowed to operate. Progress should have
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.920]   always been allowed the government should have stopped
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.080]   people from being hurt should stop negative outcomes. But the
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.520]   idea that the government should come in and start to run things
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.560]   and employ people and get to the scale that it's gotten to this
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.680]   is the largest organization in human history, the federal US
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.280]   federal government, it has got the highest dollar spend the
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.040]   highest budget of any organization in human history,
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.200]   even accounting for the Roman Empire, there should be
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.120]   accountability standards for every law, which is how do I
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.960]   know that this thing did what it was supposed to do? And how do
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.560]   I measure if it didn't? And by the way, if it doesn't, and the
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.320]   dollars aren't returned to me, it's a multiple, we shut that
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.800]   law down, we shut that department down, we move on,
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.520]   there should be an accountability standard for
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.920]   every dollar that's spent. But we don't describe any outcomes.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.400]   We don't say here's the standard of measure, and here's the
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.640]   accountability. And if it doesn't work, and if there's
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.400]   this dollar isn't returned to us, we don't spend it anymore.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.480]   And we don't keep doing this thing over and over again, and
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.200]   then layer something else on top and layer something else on top.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.840]   And then you've got 10 layers of nothing accountable to anything.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.800]   And the thing costs 10 times as much to do half as much. I am
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.280]   optimistic still, I'm always an optimist.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.480]   Oh, make sure you put in that caveat. Good. Yeah.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.640]   What's going right in your view? I feel like we just killed the
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   last good thing.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.640]   Yeah, what is going right? And you will the AI thing is what
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.880]   really pisses me off, man. I mean, this whole idea that we're
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.640]   gonna come in and tell people how to run business.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   I hear you go. Just go back to nuts. But do you think AI is
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:01.080]   going well, right now? We have nothing to really show for yet.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.880]   So it's hard to say that it's, it's cute. And it's cool. But
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.960]   there's there's nothing really
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.600]   I don't get the term. When I started my company, I had people
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.880]   that I called math people and statisticians, then there was
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   called data science, then it was called big data, then it was
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.000]   called ml. Now it's called AI. At the end of the day, it's
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.760]   software based algorithms that use three things, data, software
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.440]   and statistics. And the statistical tools and the
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.520]   approach to the software algorithm development have
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.480]   changed with the transformer model. That was paper that was
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.000]   described. But it's the same thing we've been doing since the
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.080]   1960s, which is creating packages of software that make
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.320]   predictions. And that do things for us. And all that's happened
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.360]   in the last two years, is we've seen a piece of software that
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.640]   can communicate well with us, based on these LLM. And we're
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.160]   like, oh, intelligence is here. You know, the first time a
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.240]   computer in the 1960s said, Hello, world. Everyone was like,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.560]   Oh, my God, we have AI now AI is sentient. It just said, Hello,
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.120]   world.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.600]   Well, the same thing happened when when big blue, which was a
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.560]   big IBM mainframe beat Kasparov and chess, people were like, Oh,
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.120]   my God, AI is just about here. Because at one time, being great
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.600]   at chess was considered to be only a human capability. And if
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.880]   a computer could ever get that good, the theory was that it
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.200]   would have to be an AI. But we actually found out that
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.280]   computers could do chess, but that didn't make them an AI, it
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.560]   just meant that they could acquire that one narrow
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.960]   capability. I think kind of what you're saying is that computers
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.560]   now thanks to language models, have some ability to interface
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.120]   with us using language and to understand language. By itself,
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.600]   that is not artificial intelligence in the way that
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.720]   that is portrayed in science fiction movies.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.800]   There's two key things that are happening. One is a new a new
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.400]   modality in human computer interaction through chat, which
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.680]   is incredible, and opens up lots of new software applications and
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.880]   markets, which I think can be transformative and worth
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.640]   trillions of dollars, no fucking doubt. And then the other one is
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.680]   in generative tooling where you can make art and you can make
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.440]   video and audio and all this other sort of stuff. So you're
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.760]   creating digital outputs that are not necessarily text, but
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.240]   other forms that also start to represent the expectation that
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.320]   you might otherwise have. And so that is really powerful and
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.680]   opens up all these new models for media, content, exploring
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.360]   new business models, etc. So both of those are really
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.280]   important new software capabilities that have emerged.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.760]   But this this notion that I think people confuse AI as being
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.800]   this, like, we've now got humans in software that can do things.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.280]   It's almost like back in the 60s, when the computer said,
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.160]   Hello, world. And they said the same thing.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:32.080]   I think that what people are hauled by right now is that a
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.680]   computer's ability to statistically guess has gotten
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.040]   several orders of magnitude better than it ever was before.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.000]   And so these guesses seem human and lifelike. But you'll find
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.360]   the edge cases where this stuff fails. And we'll be asking
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.920]   ourselves yet again in a few years. What the next leap is,
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.640]   but the thing that is different is that there is a level of
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.280]   investment multiplied. And Nick, I tweeted this, you can just
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.640]   show the math here, there's a level of investment, multiplied
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.680]   by a level of improvement in the underlying hardware, multiplied
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.040]   by a level of improvement in the underlying models, that's
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:16.400]   creating a 400 x improvement from the baseline every year.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.680]   And so the thing that I think is different is that we are taking
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.920]   this statistical guessing, if you want to just call it that.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.240]   And we're getting exponentially good at it. So there is an
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.720]   efficient frontier, at which point you're like, Oh, my gosh,
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.520]   this is as good as certain humans, you know, maybe not the
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.200]   smartest of the smart humans, but certain humans. And I think
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.200]   that that's what's really, really crazy and intense right
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.280]   now. So I can understand why people are like, we need to get
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.560]   a handle on this. But it may kill the golden goose. Although
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.480]   I would just say there is no golden goose yet. There's just
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.400]   a lot of really interesting stuff that people can say is
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.600]   novel, and it's inspiring to see. But by no means has there
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.720]   been just a proven use case that is 10x in productivity. Yeah,
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.680]   that hasn't happened yet.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.920]   That's the reason to wait is this whole thing just seems very
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.000]   premature. Let the technology develop a little bit. Let the
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.280]   problems become a little bit clearer, more manifest, let the
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.720]   way the cake bake, let the cake bake, let the problems emerge
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.840]   in a way, instead of we're guessing about them, we can
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.680]   actually see them, and also allow there to be time for
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.720]   solutions to be developed by the industry on its own. And we
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.800]   don't need Kamala Harris's help or guidance to do.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.200]   Okay, there you have it, folks. Thank you for joining us for
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   another episode of the all in pod. We hope that you walk away
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.680]   with the utmost of optimism, enthusiasm for the world around
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.000]   there's awe and wonder outside go take a walk and enjoy it.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.760]   There's so much more than what is on Twitter. I leave everyone
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.560]   with others what blessings and love. Gentlemen, anything else?
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.920]   Final words, David, you better fucking be there.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.240]   Oh, for poker. Yeah, I will. I will. I'm coming last week.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.800]   sacks RSVP is to poker, then texts, he's supposed to be at
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.000]   dinner. Seven o'clock text at 730. I'm on my way. 11 o'clock
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.720]   rolls around. No sacks. No idea what happened to you. You
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.320]   disappear into like the Bermuda Triangle of the Bay Area. I
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.040]   don't know where you go. But you just disappear. He gets in an
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.560]   Uber. He hasn't parked in the airport and he just plays chess.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:37.560]   Alright, boys. Bye bye bye bye bye.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:43.160]   Rain Man David
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:49.520]   sack. We open source it to the fans and they've just gone
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:49.920]   crazy.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   Love you.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   West. I squeened up.

[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:12.520]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.480]   because they're all like this like sexual tension but they
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.280]   just need to release
