[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   A listener named Ryland writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, do we need to be
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   listening for God's voice to speak to us outside of the Bible? Does He desire to
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.000]   speak to us audibly like He does to certain people in the Bible? And if so,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.840]   how do we know it's God's voice that we're hearing?" I really want to say
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.240]   something positive here and not just negative. In fact, most of what I have to
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:34.760]   say is positive. And the first and main thing is to say, "God really has spoken."
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   And this word is living and active. It's not a dead word. He really speaks today
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.960]   through the inspired scriptures. He really, really does, Ryland. He really does.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.320]   Not just with information, but with Himself, by His Spirit. 1 Samuel 3 21, "The
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.800]   Lord appeared at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.000]   the word of the Lord." That really happens. God stands forth from His inspired word
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.040]   as we read it prayerfully and dependently. And I would add this, that
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.480]   word in the Bible is more sure than anything you can hear outside the Bible.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.800]   I base that on 1 Corinthians 14 37, "If anyone thinks he's a prophet or
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.280]   spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.840]   of the Lord. If anyone does not recognize this, he's not recognized." That's amazing.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.520]   Paul is saying, "You can call yourself a prophet and get messages from God. You
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.120]   can call yourself spiritual and be tuned in to God, but if anything you say
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.800]   doesn't accord with what I say, you're not recognized." Which means that outside
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.080]   the Bible, we have fallible, uncertain impressions and messages. Inside the
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   Bible, we have rock-solid, dependable messages. So there are treasures and
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.880]   wonders and glories and dimensions of God to be seen in the Bible that we have
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.640]   scarcely seen. It seems to me to be folly to crave the lesser authority and the
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.040]   lesser riches outside the Bible than the riches and the greater authority that
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.680]   we've barely tasted, let alone digested inside the Bible. Now, having said that
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   positive thing about the Bible that I love, I just love the Bible so much and I
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   know that after, what, 60 years of reading my Bible, I've barely scratched the
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.520]   surface of glories, so I kind of get ticked, frankly, at myself and others who
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.720]   are craving stuff outside the Bible as though there's something better to be
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.280]   had out there. Having said all that, I don't see anything in the Bible that
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.240]   would say God can't communicate with us in extraordinary ways outside the Bible.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:38.760]   He can. And if he does, we should test it by his infinitely authoritative written
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Word, and we should commend it to those whose lives show a deep, long wisdom in
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.480]   Christ. There's this community dimension to testing all things. Like Paul said,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.120]   "Don't despise prophecies. Test all things. Hold fast to what is good." That's just not
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.160]   a private thing. That's something we do with others as well. But I'll close with
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:15.960]   this. Beware, Ryland, beware of craving the sensations of a voice. Jesus warned
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.420]   against those who seek a sign. So here he is, he's standing there in front of the
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:31.320]   Pharisees and scribes, speaking, and they say, "Give us a sign." What does that mean?
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.080]   It means that the voice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, wasn't adequate. They
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   needed something more. They needed to feel more, touch more, seem more. They
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.160]   wanted more, and Jesus wouldn't give it to them. And I think we're in a situation
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.840]   today not unlike that. We hear more of the Son of God than anybody in Jesus' day
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.040]   ever heard, because we have all four Gospels, and those people got it in
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   snatches. Therefore, we have the wholeness of the Revelation that Jesus meant to
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.760]   communicate, and it's speaking to us every time we read the Bible. And if we
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.120]   turn away from that and say, "But I need a sign, I need a sign, I need a voice, I
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.320]   need a tree to fall down in the woods when I'm talking, I need
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.880]   something," we're putting ourselves in the position of those who demanded a sign.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.360]   Instead, I think our heart should be, "Oh God," this is the way Paul taught the
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:49.000]   Ephesians to pray in chapter 1 verse 17, "Give my heart's eyes sight. Open my eyes
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   to your power. Open my eyes to your wisdom. Open my eyes to your inheritance.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.040]   You say stunning things that should blow me away, and give me a sense of your
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.760]   worth beyond anything any message outside should give. So Father, if I'm
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.960]   not seeing, if I'm not hearing, have mercy upon me and open my eyes."
