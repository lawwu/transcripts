[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.480]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the fourth chapter, and reading from verse 31
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.920]   to verse 35.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.440]   I am particularly concerned tonight with the thirty-second and the thirty-fourth and the
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600]   thirty-fifth verses.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.000]   The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own, but
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.440]   they are all things come.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.720]   Now here we are looking at this marvelous, wonderful picture that we have here of the
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360]   early Christian church.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.040]   We've been examining this for weeks, and we've been doing so because it is, as I say, a picture
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.340]   of what the early church was like.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.880]   We are concerned to know what Christianity is, and we are concerned to know what that
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.560]   is because of the state of our world this evening.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.320]   We are here tonight, I am in this pulpit, because I believe that this is the only hope
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.240]   for the world.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760]   Nothing is more important than this.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.520]   But there's trouble about this and confusion about this, and therefore I say we must come
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.840]   back to this only authoritative account that we have of these matters, and that is what
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.280]   we are looking at here in these early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.760]   Now we see that what happened was this.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.520]   That great event took place on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down upon
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.400]   the church and filled these men with power.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.760]   And it led to their preaching.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.680]   You notice, "With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.720]   They spake the word of God with boldness."
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.960]   And we've been looking into this.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.240]   This is what brings the church into being.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.660]   What brings the church into being is apostolic preaching.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.280]   It is the testimony and the witness to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.200]   We've seen how Peter put it in these words, "We cannot but speak the things which we have
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040]   seen and heard."
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   These men were witnesses to Jesus of Nazareth, to his life, to his teaching, to his death,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.360]   his burial, his resurrection, his ascension.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.560]   And now they are witnesses to his sending down upon them the Holy Ghost from heaven
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.040]   as he promised that he would do.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.800]   Now there would never have been a Christian church but for this.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Never.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.560]   The idea that these men, these ordinary fishermen, were possessed of sufficient genius to invent
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   all this, these marvelous stories, the thing is quite preposterous.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400]   They were incapable of it on any level whatsoever.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.440]   And certainly we would never have known such a thing as the Christian church were it not
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   that the things to which they bore witness were literal, actual, hard facts.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.960]   And their preaching consisted mainly of a recitation of these events and facts and their
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   meaning and significance.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.280]   We've been looking at some of these sermons and addresses preached and delivered by the
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   Apostle Peter.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.600]   And we have seen that in every instance that is what he does.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.080]   He states the facts, he shows how they are fulfillment of prophecy, and then he proceeds
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.960]   to apply this and to show the significance of all this to the people who were listening
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   to him.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.120]   Now, we have seen therefore that the church came into being as the result of just that.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:52.920]   This message, this apostolic message, preached and delivered in the power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.720]   And it has a mighty influence upon men and women.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.200]   We've seen it three thousand on the day of Pentecost, two thousand probably the next
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.400]   day, and on it goes from day to day, and the Lord added to the church daily such as were
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   being saved.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   That's how Luke sums it up in his history.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.120]   But what we are anxious to do tonight is to look at this society that thus comes into
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.760]   being, this community of people.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.840]   We've already been told of them in the second chapter that they continued steadfastly in
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.240]   the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayer.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.560]   They met together in one another's houses, eating bread, talking about these things,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.280]   praying together, and above all rejoicing together and praising God.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   That's the Christian church.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.320]   Not some great institution with potentates and powers and great ecclesiastics.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   There's nothing like that anywhere near the New Testament.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.520]   That's the accretions of men and of the centuries.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.800]   This is Christianity.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.920]   And here tonight we are reminded particularly of the character of this community, this society.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.600]   And what we are told about them is, you see, that they had all things common.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.880]   It's a picture of wonderful peace, a picture of unity, a picture of brotherhood, a picture,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.320]   if you like, of fellowship.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.720]   Now what brought that into being?
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.080]   Well, I say that the only answer is the gospel.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   And I want to try to show you this evening how this fellowship as we see it depicted
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.160]   here is in and of itself a proof of the gospel.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   Nothing but the gospel of Christ can ever, ever has, or ever will produce the state and
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.360]   condition of affairs which are described to us in these verses that we are looking at
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   together.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.280]   "The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.440]   Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.880]   they had all things common.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.680]   Neither was there any among them that lacked, for as many as were possessors of lands or
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.280]   houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.920]   at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made unto every man according as he had
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   need."
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.800]   That's someone, a kind of primitive communism.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.280]   That's what communism does.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.720]   That's exactly what it produces.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.840]   It makes all men equal in this way, and they share all their goods.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.120]   That's nothing but an example of an experiment at communism, which didn't succeed, but men
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.960]   have continued to try it from time to time.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.560]   They tried it again in the 17th century, some of them, the Levellers and others, and here
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   it is.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.160]   There's only hope for the world that we accept this principle of communism, and all share
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.880]   everything in common in this way.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   But is this communism?
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.760]   Well, it's amazing that anybody should ever imagine that it is.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.200]   I want to try to show you that it's the exact opposite of communism, or of any other effort
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.400]   and endeavor on the part of men to produce this kind of community.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   What's the difference?
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.280]   Well, there's one difference here which is enough in and of itself.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.400]   You notice that what happened here was entirely voluntary.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.440]   How much of the voluntary principle is there in Russia tonight, or in any other communist
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   country?
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.720]   There's no voluntarism where there is communism.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.480]   Communism does what it does by the power of the sword.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.040]   It's power, it's force, and if you defy it, what happens to you?
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.640]   You're eliminated.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.200]   Communism has eliminated, to use that terrible term, more people, probably even the Nazism
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   did.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   This is the antithesis of communism.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.920]   Communism imposes an equality.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.160]   Here there is a voluntary equality, a rejoicing in doing it, not done in a spirit of fear
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.320]   and terror, not because you've got secret police that are watching you and you have
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.600]   no choice in the matter.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.440]   This imposed system is the exact opposite.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.520]   No, no, this isn't communism.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.680]   This is not the spirit of fear and of terror and of compulsion.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.640]   It is the exact opposite.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.600]   It is the spirit of joy and of rejoicing, of men and women voluntarily doing this thing
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.200]   of which we read here.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.160]   Well, now then, here you see is the thing to which I call your attention on this Sunday
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.400]   night before Christmas Day.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.880]   The world is seeking for peace.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.640]   The world is seeking for unity.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.220]   The world is seeking for fellowship.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.880]   The world is seeking for brotherhood.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   As Christmas comes around, year by year, men still continue to talk about this.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.520]   Why?
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.040]   Because the world is torn.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   The world is in trouble.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   Look at it tonight.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   Here it is once more.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:20.360]   The problem in Rhodesia, nations breaking off diplomatic relations with this country,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   fighting in Vietnam.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.560]   Well, I needn't remind you of the sorry catalogue.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   The world is ill.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   The world is sick.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.680]   The world is unhappy.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.880]   The world is torn by strife and war and bloodshed.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.320]   That's why I'm calling your attention to all this.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:44.280]   The world, the mankind throughout its long history, has been seeking a peace, a fellowship,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.240]   a brotherhood amongst men.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.440]   It talks a great deal about this.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.800]   It sets up its institutions one after another.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.640]   It gives them different names, but it's the same thing.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   League of Nations at one time, United Nations at another.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.120]   The world has always been dreaming this dream, and it's done its utmost to produce some
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:12.920]   kind of organization that will really deal with the problem of mankind at strike and
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.880]   produce a condition of peace and of happiness and of brotherhood and of fellowship.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.080]   The world is seeking it tonight as much as it's ever done and is talking about it as
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.040]   much as it has ever done.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.480]   But what is so obvious is this, isn't it?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.760]   That the world can never produce it.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.080]   If it could, it would have done so.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   The world has failed, and it's failing tonight as much as it has ever done to produce peace
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.400]   and brotherhood, fellowship and friendship amongst men and women.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:56.320]   Now it is to that kind of background that I'm anxious to call your attention this evening
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.800]   to this description which we are given here of the early church.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.600]   Here is the very thing, you see, that the world has been looking for and cannot find.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.680]   Here it is.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:14.000]   And this is what you always have when you get true Christian people.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.240]   Now then, let's examine this therefore together.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.640]   Let us therefore ask the first obvious question.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.880]   Why is it that the world lacks peace?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.520]   Why is our world as it is tonight?
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.680]   That's the question.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:41.160]   Why does mankind go on killing itself, dividing itself up, building these terrible armaments?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.200]   What's the explanation of it all?
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.400]   Now there, I think you must agree, is the great fundamental question which we are forced
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.960]   and compelled to ask at the present time perhaps more than ever, especially in the light of
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.080]   the fact that mankind at the end of the last century in particular was so confident that
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.680]   it was going to produce a state of peace.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.200]   Oh, those poets of the mid and the late Victorian era, and they simply expressed what everybody
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.320]   thought, the confidence of that era.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.200]   There's never been anything more pathetic, I think, in the whole of human history.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Parliament of men, the federation of the world.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.320]   Oh, the golden age that was coming, and in this century it was due to come, but it hasn't
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   come.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   Why not?
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   What's the matter?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.680]   Now, I suggest to you that until you answer that question, you have no right to go any
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.120]   further, you have no right to proceed.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.200]   That is the first fundamental question.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.000]   And I'm here to suggest to you once more that there's only one answer to that question,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.960]   and it's the answer that you find in this book called the Bible.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   If I had no other reason for believing this book, I would believe it for this reason.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.800]   It is the only book that I know of that makes an accurate diagnosis.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   There is nothing else that explains the present state of the world as such as this does.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:15.200]   And it is because the world has never really discovered its ultimate problem, that all
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.680]   its efforts at amelioration fail.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.240]   They're bound to fail.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.760]   If your diagnosis is wrong, your treatment must be wrong, and it is wrong, and it's
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   futile.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.800]   I want to start with the only explanation of the trouble.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   What is it?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.520]   Well, it can be put as simply as this.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:41.560]   All men's troubles are due to his wrong relationship with God.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.840]   That's the trouble, and it's the whole of the trouble.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:50.880]   Of course, the statesmen, the United Nations, they're looking, as somebody put it horizontally,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   looking at one another.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.640]   They forget God, and that's why all they do is futile.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.720]   The problem is not primarily between men and men, it's between men and God.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.040]   There's a great statement made by the prophet Isaiah, and he repeats it.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.880]   And here it is, it's the key to the modern problem.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:17.320]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now that's a terrible statement, but it's true.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.880]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.560]   However advanced, however developed, however learned, however wealthy, however important
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:35.000]   nations may be, they will never know peace while they're wicked."
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.720]   And wicked means, of course, this wrong relationship to God.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.840]   Now, all men's troubles are due to that.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.720]   All men's troubles result from the fact that he's in a state of sin, and in a state of
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.200]   rebellion against God.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.080]   Now you take any other prophet explanation of the state of the world, or look at any
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.240]   of the attempts to deal with the problem, and you'll find they never touch that, they
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.960]   never mention it, and that's why they all come to nothing.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:16.640]   The truth about man is this, that he was made to be God-centered.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.040]   That's a part of his very nature and being.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   He didn't make himself.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.200]   He hasn't just happened.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.920]   Man is not just an accident.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:34.440]   No, no, man was created and made by God, and he was made in such a way that he can only
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:42.160]   function truly, and successfully, and happily, as long as he obeys the laws of his nature.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:50.000]   And he was made in such a manner that he can only function truly, as I say, when he obeys
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   God's laws.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.680]   Now, it's no use objecting to that.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:01.080]   You might as well object to this watch, and say now that it's wrong that this watch goes
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.980]   because one wheel turns this way and another that way.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.840]   You may say the man shouldn't have made the watch like that.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.320]   The point is he has.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.920]   And this watch functions, and it does its work, well, by being wound up and acting according
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   to the laws of its own make.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.520]   And man is exactly the same.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   Man objects to this.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   He doesn't like it.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.360]   That's exactly why he gets into trouble.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.200]   He is fighting against his own constitution.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.840]   He is fighting against the laws of his own nature, and of his own being, and of his own
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.640]   creation, and hence all his troubles.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:44.080]   Man's happiness always depends upon his relationship to God.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.880]   Now, how anybody who's ever read the Bible can dispute that, passes my comprehension.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.760]   Take it in the case of individuals, take it in the case of nations, and you get this abundant
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.800]   evidence with regard to this.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.240]   You find great men here, you see them happy and miserable, then you see them rejoicing
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   and happy.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   What's the difference?
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.840]   Well, it's all a question of their relationship to God, always, invariably.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.120]   Look at a man like David.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.000]   You see him rejoicing, you read some of his great psalms.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.320]   He cries out one day, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:27.480]   But then you read the 51st Psalm, and you find him in a condition of wretchedness, misery,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:34.160]   and unhappiness, "Created me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.680]   He's down in the depths, and what's the matter?
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   What makes the difference?
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.800]   Oh, it's always his relationship to God.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.200]   When he obeys God, he sings the 23rd Psalm.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.880]   When he disobeys and rebels, down in the depths of Psalm 51.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.200]   Now, this is the universal law, you find it running through the whole of the history of
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   the Old Testament.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.520]   The same in the New, and the same in the history and the story of mankind everywhere.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.680]   Man having been made like this, can only function truly and can only find happiness and peace
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:16.160]   and joy to the extent that he obeys the laws of God, which are the laws of his own constitution.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.880]   But man sets himself up against this, and this is the whole cause of his trouble.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.120]   Man, you see, was never meant to be master.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.360]   He was meant to be servant.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.280]   He was meant to be in the position of obedience.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:40.120]   God is the Lord, God is the master, God is the governor of the universe.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.040]   And man was made to obey the laws of God, and if he'd done so, the world would have
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.160]   continued to be paradise, it would have continued to be peace.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.840]   But man didn't like this.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   Man rebelled against this.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.200]   Man felt that this was robbing him of something of his greatness.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.280]   That's the original sin, that's the original fall of man.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.400]   Man beginning to assert himself.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:12.160]   Man claiming for himself the right of government and of judgment and of ordering his own affairs.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.360]   Man, if you like, setting himself up as an autonomous being, no longer recognizing the
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:26.600]   supreme governor and the final law, but every man setting himself up as a governor and as
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   a law giver.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:34.480]   In other words, if you like, the world is in its trouble tonight because man, instead
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.440]   of being God-centered, has become self-centered.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.000]   That's the whole problem, self-centeredness.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.180]   The moment man became self-centered, he lost his happiness, he lost everything.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.880]   But that is the trouble, and it's still true, is it not?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.440]   Mankind objects to the belief in God, it objects to the law of God.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   It doesn't like the very term law.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.880]   It objects today more than ever to discipline.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.360]   Man wants to be free, he says, to live his own life in his own way.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:11.020]   Yes, but unfortunately for the individual, every other individual is exactly the same.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.280]   And you see, the trouble in the world is due to this, that instead of all bowing down before
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:22.360]   and worshiping and adoring the only true and living God, the world is full of gods.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.400]   We're all gods.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.040]   And we're all saying, by nature, "Why shouldn't I?
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.400]   I have a right to do what I like and what I think is best."
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.040]   In other words, we're all self-centered, we're all selfish, we're all considering
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.800]   ourselves and nobody else.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.600]   That's why, you see, you get divorce and little children suffering and all the agony
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.840]   and the pain of the world tonight.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.520]   People are only thinking of themselves and what's going to make them happy and give them
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.160]   joy and pleasure nobody else has thought of.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.880]   But you see, the tragedy is that the world is full of people like this.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.800]   And so you get all these terrible troubles.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.640]   It's inevitable.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.440]   Man was never meant to govern himself, he's not fit to, he's not big enough.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   He doesn't know enough, he can't see enough.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.160]   He's in a universe that's bigger than he is and that baffles him.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.480]   But he's always trying to and claiming it and the result is he's unhappy and he's restless
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.960]   and he's never satisfied.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.880]   He becomes irritable and because he's irritable he quarrels with others.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.680]   Because everybody's irritable you're bound to get a clash.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.520]   Now, you know, that's the whole trouble with the world tonight, isn't it?
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   And of course, setting ourselves up, we look at others and we judge them.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.440]   If we think they're higher up than we are, we're jealous of them and we're envious of
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.760]   them and we're going to pull them down.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.160]   What right have they to be there?
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.160]   But if we happen to be up, we look down upon the others and say their place is down there.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.480]   They have no right to be up here, they're not equal to me.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.720]   Now, you see, this is it, isn't it?
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.200]   And the whole world is divided up like this.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.080]   Men divide themselves up according to their ability or lack of ability.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.600]   They divide themselves up according to the color of their skins.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.840]   One is essentially superior to the other.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.800]   They divide themselves up in the amount of money that they possess, wealth and position,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.600]   tradition, a thousand and one things.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.200]   This is all, you see, the result of men not seeing himself truly.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.760]   Men setting himself up and therefore looking at others in terms of his own greatness.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.800]   And either he's denied it by another or else he despises someone who's down below him.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:40.360]   And so you see the world tonight is full of jealousy and of envy, full of malice and spite
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.200]   and bitterness and hatred.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.040]   What is the problem in Rhodesia?
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.240]   What is it?
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   What is it really?
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.040]   And what's the problem between Rhodesia and this country?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   What is the real explanation?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.440]   I'm giving it to you.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.600]   And it's the explanation of all the problems in the world tonight.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.080]   Sometimes it's put by the historians as being the problem of the haves and the have-nots.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   All right, it's just one manifestation of it.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:12.240]   Haves, have-nots, color, black, white, yellow, pink, whatever it may be, and all these various
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.920]   other manifestations, but it's the one problem.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.160]   It's man setting himself up.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.520]   He becomes a god.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.440]   Well now then, there is the explanation of why the world is in its present tragic unhappy
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.200]   state and condition.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.480]   And it is the only explanation.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.080]   The politicians and the statesmen, the philosophers and others, they don't begin to see this,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:48.200]   because they never start with this fundamental question of man in his relationship to God.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.560]   That's why there is no peace.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.520]   That's why there's no fellowship.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.040]   That's why there's no unity.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.880]   That's why the picture is so much a contrast to that which we read of here in the case
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.400]   of the early church.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.360]   But let me go on to a second principle.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.600]   That is why the world is as it is.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:15.000]   But let us now consider why it is that all the efforts of the world at producing peace
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.280]   inevitably fail.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.060]   Now I've already given you the one big answer, and that is that it fails at this first question.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.760]   But let's look at it in another way.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.720]   Has it not struck you that the world in all its efforts and endeavors to produce peace
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.280]   is tragically superficial?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.520]   They seem to think it's so easy, and they're surprised and disappointed when they fail.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.200]   You've only got to call a conference.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.920]   Mr. Neville Chamberlain thought that he'd only got to go and visit Hitler and talk to
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.800]   him as a businessman across the table.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   No problem.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   Quite simple.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.560]   And they go on doing that, don't they?
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   But it doesn't succeed.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.560]   You see, what's the matter?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.680]   Well, I say it's all so tragically superficial.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.240]   They seem to think that this is only a problem for the mind.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.760]   You see, they say if only you can get people to come to the conference table, then when
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.000]   you put your cards on the table or when you put your case, well, every reasonable man
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.040]   must surely admit it at once.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.320]   Poor old H.G. Wells.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   He believed that you could banish war.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.440]   Man would do away with war.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.720]   It's only primitive people who fight, he says.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   Educated people won't fight.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   Of course not.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   They've got too much sense.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   They can think and see what they're doing.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.600]   And they say, look here, don't start hitting meat at a conference table.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   Then all will be well, and you'll all agree to banish war, and you'll never have another
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.040]   war in the long history of the human race.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.600]   It's only a question for the mind, they say.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   It's only a question of applying reason, sweet reason, to the problems and the perplexities
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   of mankind.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.080]   That's the view, isn't it?
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.520]   And then another characteristic of this non-Christian view of the way of trying to find peace is
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.880]   that it's always so negative.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   You see, what they mean by peace is cessation of war.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.800]   They think that if only all the nations would destroy their armaments, you'd have peace,
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.440]   but you wouldn't.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.000]   You can destroy all your armaments, you won't have peace.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.760]   You won't have peace in homes, in families.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.120]   You won't have peace between classes.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.520]   To start with, they'll never burn up all their armaments while man remains man.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.240]   But you see, it's negative.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.020]   The view is always negative.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.220]   We put a stop to war.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.040]   To me, there are no people in the world tonight who are so opposed to the Christian faith
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.480]   as the pacifists.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.920]   I mean the people who say that you really can do this by applying reason and teaching
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   to the situation.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   Why are they so wrong?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   Well, for this reason.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.480]   That they've never realized that the cause of every kind of warfare, whether it be a
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.040]   quarrel between a husband and a wife, or a man and another man, or a woman and a woman,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:21.800]   every quarrel, every fighting, every lack of peace and fellowship, is always due to
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.120]   a wrong heart.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.840]   Not a wrong mind, but a wrong heart.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.400]   The whole problem with men ultimately is in his heart.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.200]   I'm not depreciating the mind when I say that.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:41.440]   I'm simply saying this, that a true psychology of men realizes that the mind is not the greatest
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   and the controlling factor in men.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.000]   All men are ruled by their hearts.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.680]   A man may be a great man.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.120]   He may be a man who has great knowledge, and he has great wisdom and understanding.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.520]   Does that mean that he of necessity lives a good life?
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.360]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.080]   There's something deeper in him, something elemental.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.680]   He will do himself what he condemns in another.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.640]   Give him an objective case, he'll give you a perfect judgment.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   Look at his own life, and you'll find that he doesn't apply the same wisdom.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   Why?
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.160]   Because it's governed by his heart.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.000]   And the problem of peace is the problem of men's heart.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.420]   It's men's nature that's at trouble.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.540]   It isn't merely the lack of thinking.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.520]   It's this elemental force, this power, this driving something.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.640]   Or as James puts it, "Why are there wars whence come wars amongst you?"
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   And he answers his own question.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:41.360]   "Come they not," he says, "of your own lusts, that war within you, desire, lust?"
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.000]   The heart is the cause of the trouble.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.320]   Or let me put it in another form, and this again is of supreme importance.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:00.280]   Non-Christian thinking can never see that peace is never something that you should aim
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.720]   at directly.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.280]   Peace always comes indirectly.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:15.200]   You can say, if you like, the same thing about peace as you do about happiness.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:22.120]   Now, the last man to be really happy is the man who's living for happiness.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.760]   If you set out to live for happiness, you'll never get it.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.080]   Happiness must never be sought directly.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.520]   Happiness is always a by-product.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.960]   It's a by-product of something else.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.920]   It's a by-product of something else.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.280]   And if you don't realize that, you'll go wrong about happiness or about peace.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.240]   Set up happiness as the one goal, you'll never get there.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.080]   Set up peace as the goal, you'll never get there.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.480]   Peace is a by-product of something else.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.120]   What's that?
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.960]   The answer the Bible gives to that is righteousness.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.600]   Righteousness.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.840]   And here again is one of these fundamental propositions of the whole of the Scripture.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.200]   Now let me give it to you in the words of James, who has put this matter very clearly,
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.760]   it seems to me, at the end of his third chapter, where he puts it like this.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.680]   He's dealing with this whole question of warfare.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.080]   He says, "Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   Let him show out of a good conversation," which means behavior, "his works with meekness
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   of wisdom."
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.360]   That's the thing, meekness of wisdom.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.160]   But he says, "If you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not and lie
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.400]   not against the truth.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:56.160]   This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.440]   For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.400]   But the wisdom that is from above is first pure."
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.440]   Pure, notice, that's the thing he puts first.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.240]   The wisdom that is from above is first pure.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.800]   It's clean, it's righteous, then peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated, full of mercy
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.920]   and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:32.720]   And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that seek peace.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.340]   You see what he's saying is this.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.760]   If a man shows righteousness, he will have peace.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.960]   It's the fruit of righteousness.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.440]   But the tragedy of the statesmen and the world apart from Christ is this.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:50.160]   They're always trying to sow peace and they're never producing it.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.080]   If they begin to sow righteousness, then they have a hope of peace.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.440]   Now here is the great central message of the whole of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.160]   Why is man not at peace?
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   The answer is because he's not righteous.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:15.440]   I quoted it at the beginning, "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.280]   He can be very clever, very learned, very wise.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.000]   He can advance in scientific knowledge.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.960]   He can do so many things that the modern world is doing, but there's no peace.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   Why?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.400]   Well, because he's not righteous.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.640]   Peace is always a by-product.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:42.240]   Peace is always the result of righteousness, purity, holiness, right relationship to God,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.680]   and obedience to his holy laws and commands.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.880]   But the world, you see, has forgotten God and it's trying to find peace and to produce
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   it.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   It never can.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.960]   It's based upon righteousness.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.840]   Or looking at it the other way around, the root that produces peace is righteousness
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.600]   and truth and justice and purity.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.920]   Indeed it is a conformity to the holy law of God.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:15.360]   Very well then, my friends, that is why all the world's attempts at peace must inevitably
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   fail.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.080]   They're trying to patch up quarrels.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.560]   They're trying to find a formula, a compromise.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.240]   They take their officials with them and they spend their time trying to produce a sentence
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240]   that will just do it.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.600]   But it's only a sort of armistice.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.280]   It's only a temporary cessation of warfare.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:38.560]   And what we are out for is peace, fellowship, fraternity.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.440]   And this is a matter of the heart.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.680]   This is a matter of something elemental and fundamental.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.560]   It's something that results from man's nature.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:55.080]   And it is always based upon righteousness and truth and the holiness of God.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.800]   Very well, that is why all the efforts of the world at peace inevitably and always come
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   to nothing.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.600]   But there is a peace that is possible.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:14.520]   Here it is at the end of this fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.880]   How is this obtained?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.600]   How does this come into being?
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:25.640]   Well, here is my Christmas message for you.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.880]   Christ alone can give peace.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.200]   Christ alone can lead to this condition.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:39.440]   He alone produces fellowship and brotherhood and all the things that the world is longing
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:44.960]   for but longing in vain.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:52.920]   The message of Christmas is that he came into the world in order to make and to produce
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.640]   and to give us this peace.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   Who is he?
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.600]   He is the Prince of Peace.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.160]   But that is not his only title.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.960]   He is also the King of Righteousness.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   You see, it is always there.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   The prophet, the psalmist acting as a prophet, discovered it long ago.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.240]   He said, "Righteousness and peace have kissed each other."
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.040]   They have met together.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:34.800]   And they have met together in this one blessed person, Jesus of Nazareth, who was born in
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.920]   the stable in Bethlehem and whose little body was placed in the manger.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.960]   And Charles Wesley is right again when he hails him in these words, "Hail, the heaven-born
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.760]   Prince of Peace!
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.800]   Hail, the Son of Righteousness!"
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.640]   You see, the two things always go together.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:05.480]   And there is no peace unless we take them together.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:12.640]   And the whole purpose of the incarnation of the Son of God, I say, was to bring in this
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.240]   reign of peace, of which he is the Prince.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.680]   He does it by his teaching.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.840]   He taught men to love one another as no one else has ever done, but he did not stop at
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.960]   teaching.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:38.520]   And we must never forget this, his teaching alone will never produce peace.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.040]   And that is where I say that the people who call themselves pacifists are the ones who
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.000]   deny him and his teaching most of all.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.200]   They say, "But look, look at the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.520]   He tells you to turn the other cheek.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.880]   He tells you to love your enemies and to do good to them that hate you.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.920]   And you've only got to tell people to do that and they'll do it and there'll be
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   an end to war."
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.600]   But they don't do it.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.000]   Why?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.640]   Well, because they cannot do it.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.200]   And why can't they do it?
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.000]   Well, they can't do it for the reason that I've already given you.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.440]   The trouble is not in their minds but in their hearts.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:25.680]   No man in his senses can love war, and yet men go to war against their reason, against
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.360]   their own wisdom and understanding.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   So I say that he brings in peace not even by his teaching.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.520]   How does he make peace?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.040]   And the answer is here, right through the New Testament.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.640]   He does it by his death and by his resurrection.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.200]   It's the only way.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.480]   It's here you see the way to peace.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.920]   Teaching alone can't do it.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.600]   Something further is needed.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.480]   Man's whole nature, man's relationship to God is wrong and that is why there is
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   no peace.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.640]   And he's got to deal with this problem and here he does it.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.080]   Listen to Paul putting it in the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:22.480]   But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off for midnight by the blood of Christ,
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:28.200]   for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:42.240]   in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace, and that he
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:50.440]   might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity, thereby
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:56.400]   man came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh, here
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:05.600]   it is, he makes peace through the blood of his cross.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.240]   What does this mean?
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.160]   Well you see it can be put like this.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:20.540]   It is only as you look at this blessed person who was born as the baby in Bethlehem.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.400]   Look at him there.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.640]   Look at him as a boy aged twelve in the temple.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.000]   Look at him working as a carpenter.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.960]   Look at him going out to preach at the age of thirty, watch his miracles, listen to his
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.960]   superb teaching.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.240]   But oh come I say and look at the cross.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   What's he doing there?
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.440]   If he's son of God.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.360]   What does this mean?
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:52.160]   And here and here alone we find the answer and the solution to our problem.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.080]   What is he doing there I ask and the only answer is this.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.400]   He is there because of our utter sinfulness.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.800]   He is there because of our guilt.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.720]   He is there because of our complete helplessness.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.280]   What's he doing there?
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:19.000]   He is there because man is guilty before God and is under the curse of God instead of being
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.760]   under the blessing of God.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.360]   And that is why man is ill at ease and restless and is fighting and trying to find something
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   he cannot find.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.800]   It's this relationship to God and he has come to put that right and there and there alone
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.040]   he puts it right.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.440]   The first problem of man is the problem of his guilt and of his sinfulness.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:49.720]   The problem of his alienation from a holy and a righteous God.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:56.760]   And there is no hope for peace until righteousness has been restored, until man is reconciled
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.440]   and restored to God.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.160]   And there's only one way for it and it was taken when the son of God went to the cross
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   on Calvary's hill.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.000]   He makes peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.560]   It is there and there alone we see what we are and our plight and our need and there
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:24.880]   we see that he reconciles us and procures our pardon.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.640]   Without that there is no hope of peace.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.400]   A man must be at peace with God before he can be at peace with himself or peace with
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.640]   anybody else.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:43.600]   But being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.840]   And it is there alone I find it, but not only that, and this is wonderful, he not only procures
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:59.800]   the pardon of my sin and clears my guilt, he gives me a new life and a new nature.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.560]   He gives me a new heart.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.480]   And as I've been showing you this is men's fundamental need.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.320]   Men doesn't need instruction, he needs a heart.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   This is the condemnation that light is coming to the world, but men love darkness rather
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.400]   than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.680]   You think the only thing the world needs tonight is light and instruction?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   Well here it is.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.520]   If only the world applied this the world would be paradise again.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.880]   There's no more light, here it is.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.800]   Here is the way of life, the way of living.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.560]   Well why is the world as it is?
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.840]   The answer is it doesn't like this.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:45.640]   You know the world tonight prefers to be drinking and indulging in sex rather than studying
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   this.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.720]   The world doesn't want this kind of life.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.560]   It really despises Jesus of Nazareth and the way in which he lived.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.120]   The world wants what it's doing in London tonight and it laughs at this and ridicules
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.240]   this.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.720]   The clever men on the wireless and the television, they cater to the public palate.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.560]   A little bit of spice in it isn't there?
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.680]   None of this straight, less narrow Christianity.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.080]   The world isn't interested in purity, it's not interested in righteousness and decency,
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.200]   and yet it's surprised that it's fighting and that it hasn't got peace and rest and
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   fellowship.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.560]   My dear friends you've got to obey the laws.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.520]   If you love these evil things you'll reap your consequences.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:34.120]   Whatsoever a man soweth actually also reap, and it's an absolute law.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.880]   No, no, what man needs is not light and knowledge and instruction.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.200]   He's had enough of it throughout the centuries.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.760]   The Greek philosophers have tried it as well as the Bible, but man doesn't listen to it.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.640]   He doesn't put it into practice.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:54.860]   What man needs is a new heart, a heart that'll love the light and hate the darkness instead
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.720]   of loving the darkness and hating the light.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.160]   And until mankind has a new heart it'll never have peace.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:11.600]   As long as it's governed by its lust and evil desires there will be restlessness and war
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.980]   and strife and envying and all that is ugly and foul.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.120]   But in Christ Jesus there's a new heart possible.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.240]   Do you know why he came down and took on human nature?
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.920]   He did it in order that he might found a new humanity.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.200]   He knew that we need to be renewed.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.380]   He knew that we need new hearts, new natures, new lives, new everything.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.320]   He took on human nature in order that joining it to the divine he could give it us.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.520]   We can be born again.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.380]   That's the glory of the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:50.260]   He solves all the problems of men.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:45:00.340]   Man's relationship to God, man's evil heart and nature, they're dealt with and dealt with
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.620]   alone in the gospel of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.920]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.860]   He died to make us good.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.900]   The gospel doesn't stop at forgiveness of sins.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.380]   There's a new birth as he was born in Bethlehem.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:24.140]   You and I can be born again, born of the Spirit, born of God, born as the children of God,
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.820]   become partakers of the divine nature.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.700]   That's the message.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:34.740]   He came down and took on human nature in order that he might, linking it to himself and purifying
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:42.100]   it, give it back to us and so start anew and a cleansed and a purified humanity.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.580]   That's the message of Christmas.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:51.860]   These people, here they are, you see, and in addition he gives us the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.700]   They were all filled with the Spirit and then they began to behave in this way.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.700]   Why?
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:04.300]   Well, you see, the Spirit produces a certain type of fruit.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.380]   And what is the fruit of the Spirit?
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.740]   Well, you remember the great answer given to that question by the Apostle Paul in the
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.900]   fifth chapter of his epistle to the Galatians.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   Listen.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:27.660]   "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, faith, meekness,
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.660]   temperance."
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.660]   Oh, that's what the world needs tonight, isn't it?
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.540]   Look at this old warring world, look at the unhappiness, the strife, the trouble, the
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   agony.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.540]   What does it need?
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   Here it is.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:56.180]   Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.060]   This is the need of men.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.660]   Not instruction, not enlightenment, not education, not conferences, not consultations, not compromises.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.660]   They won't achieve anything.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:12.620]   Man needs to have a nature out of which will grow the fruit, the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:17.780]   Love and joy and peace and longsuffering, able to bear with others.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.580]   Here is peace.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:26.980]   And you see, the moment these people began to believe this message, and the moment they
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.300]   were all filled with the Spirit, this is what happened.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.460]   The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.980]   They hadn't always been like that.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.900]   They'd been quarreling, they'd been envying, they belonged to different nations, and they
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.300]   were like all the rest of us by nature, but they're welded into one.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:52.700]   And there is this amazing understanding and this generosity and help and love and all
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.540]   giving for others and sacrifice.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.420]   Here is peace.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   Here is fellowship.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   Here is brotherhood.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   Why?
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.860]   You see, I've already given you the answer.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.860]   These are new people.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.300]   These are not people who've just decided to take up the teaching of Jesus and to apply
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   it.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   They're born again.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.300]   They're filled with the Spirit.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.980]   They've got new natures.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.660]   They've got new hearts.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.180]   They're new men and women, and they're amazed at themselves.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.180]   But this is Christianity.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.980]   This is the very thing.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:35.220]   It does what the world is vainly trying to do, and it's all in this blessed person, the
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.740]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.380]   You see, what happens is this.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:45.820]   The moment men and women are born again, because they're all born of the same Spirit and inherit
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:53.780]   the same nature, they all become one in a new and in a strange sense.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.580]   They see everything in a new way.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.860]   When a man is born again, he sees himself in a new way.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.740]   He used to think a great deal of himself and was very proud of himself.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:13.140]   The moment a man is born again, he never does that again.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.180]   He sees that he was a fool.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.020]   He sees that he was blind.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.740]   He sees that he was ignorant.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:27.540]   He sees that he was his own worst enemy, but he's the only man who does.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.860]   A man who becomes a Christian is a man who's first convicted of sin.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.860]   He's knocked down.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.860]   He's humiliated.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.100]   He becomes nothing.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.340]   He sees himself as a vile, a hopeless, a useless sinner.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.460]   He sees his selfishness and self-centeredness.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.380]   He knows the truth about himself for the first time in his life, and he only gets to know
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:56.140]   it as he confronts this blessed person who was born as a babe in the stable and put into
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.340]   the manger there in Bethlehem.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:04.340]   Standing face to face with him, he sees himself and he's humbled and he's ashamed.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:10.780]   Like Saul of Tarsus, he says that he is the greatest and the chiefest of all sinners.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:19.660]   But you see, he not only has a new view of himself, he has a new view of others also.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.060]   And what he sees now is that they're all just like himself.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.020]   He used to think they were very different.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.980]   He was right, everybody else was wrong.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.660]   He sees now that he's wrong and they are wrong.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.860]   Everybody's wrong.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.620]   And we're all fools together, and we're all lying in the dust of hopelessness and of helplessness.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:46.220]   He furthermore sees that now life is entirely different from what he thought it was.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.580]   He thought life was just a place in which you eat and drink and make money and buy the
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.580]   things you want.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:57.860]   And money can buy them, yes, but it can never buy happiness and it can never buy peace.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.140]   And now he begins to see that life was not meant to be that, that man's not an animal,
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.620]   that man is a pilgrim of eternity, that man is a creature made by God, that man was meant
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:14.060]   to be like that babe in Bethlehem as a babe, and as he grows up as a man, that's life,
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   that's man.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:19.540]   He sees that he's meant to live like that, and that life is big and great and glorious,
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.220]   not something just to go through, getting out of it the best you can and forgetting
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.220]   everybody else.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.460]   No, no, his views are revolutionized.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:36.460]   He sees himself, he sees others, he sees the whole of life in a different way.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:42.940]   And he looks at his fellow men and women here with him in the company, and he sees that
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:50.220]   he and all they are now what they are, not because of anything in themselves, but because
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.780]   of the grace of God.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.860]   "I am what I am," says Paul, "by the grace of God, and so are these others."
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.340]   Well, there's nothing to boast about then, is there?
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.260]   We used to look at one another, and has he got more brains than I have, is he better
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.180]   than I am, has he got more money, and if so, I'm going to beat him.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.500]   But now, you see, you look at him and you look at yourself and you see you're nothing,
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.380]   you're all paupers, you've all got nothing to boast about at all, and you're Christians
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   together.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   Why?
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.380]   Because of what?
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.380]   The life you've lived?
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.380]   Not at all.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.380]   Because of the grace of God.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.700]   And we're all receivers of the grace of God.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.460]   Boasting is dismissed.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:34.100]   We are all paupers who've been given the same fortune, and we're all one, and we rejoice
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.220]   in the same Savior.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.420]   We like to sing about the same Savior.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.280]   We like to sing the same carols, the same hymns.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.380]   We like to read the same scriptures.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.100]   We like to meditate about Him, the one who's come out of the glory and humbled himself
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:53.740]   even to the death of the cross in order that we might be made rich.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:53:00.380]   You know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, says Paul, that though he was rich, for our
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.020]   sakes he became poor.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.020]   And you know when you're singing the same songs with people, you're one with them, and
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:14.380]   you begin to love them, and you rejoice together with them in the same Savior.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:21.780]   But above all, you see, now, these people have come to look at the whole of life in
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.780]   the same way.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:31.180]   Before, this world was everything, was all, and there was nothing else.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.700]   It's no longer like that.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:42.660]   They've all come to see together that this life is but a journey, it's but a pilgrimage.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:50.140]   We are all but strangers and pilgrims, travelers and journeymen.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:56.300]   As he came into the world from the glory, passed through it and went back to the glory,
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.500]   we all are sent into this world by God not to stay here.
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:07.580]   We are meant for a glorious heritage.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.060]   We are traveling the same journey together.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:20.300]   Christians are people who say together in unison, "Here we know continuing city, but
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.060]   we seek one to come."
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.060]   He's gone before us.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.500]   He's gone to prepare a place for us.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.620]   He has told us that in my father's house are many mansions.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.620]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.340]   We look at this world as simply a place of transition.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.020]   Why should I holler at my wealth?
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.100]   Why should I have all and the other man nothing?
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.780]   Why should I say, "Let him get on with it.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.780]   He's unlucky.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.780]   I'm lucky."
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.780]   No, no.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.100]   I say this is only temporary.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.060]   This is only passing.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:53.020]   We are all one, and we are all making for the same eternal home.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:58.540]   We are all looking forward to the same glorious inheritance.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:05.980]   We see that this is not only a passing world, but also an evil world, a world of which you
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:13.140]   can always say, "Change and decay and all around I see."
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.020]   We are slipping out of it, and it is passing away.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.180]   The world and its kingdoms and its glory, it's all passing.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   It's all vanishing.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.460]   A man who lives for this world is a fool.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:29.980]   But these men are enlightened, and their eyes are all together on the glory to which they
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.860]   are going and for which he by the Spirit is preparing them.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.260]   And so it is inevitable.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.540]   The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.580]   Neither said any of them that all of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.260]   all things common and all the rest.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.660]   You see, they've understood this birth at Bethlehem.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:54.660]   They know who he is.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   They know why he came.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.620]   They see the meaning of his death and his burial and his resurrection.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:06.940]   They know that he's seated there and waiting for them and preparing a place for them.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.860]   And so instead of looking at one another and being filled with jealousy and envy or with
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:20.100]   contempt, they look at one another and love one another.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:25.580]   They belong to the same God, the same Father, the same Savior, and they're making for the
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.500]   same country.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:35.060]   And they're going to be joined heirs and participators in the great same inheritance.
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:40.300]   And so it is true to save them at the beginning, and is true tonight, through the night of
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:49.740]   doubt and sorrow onward goes the pilgrim band, singing songs of expectation, marching to
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.540]   the promised land.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:57:01.340]   They have the one thought, the one belief, the one rejoicing, and the one glorious, blessed,
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:09.980]   eternal hope, which can never fail, my dear friends.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.700]   When will this sad old world begin to listen to this message?
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.700]   Listen.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:22.620]   Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:29.420]   Beneath the angel's strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:35.660]   And men at war with men hears not the love song which they bring.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:42.700]   O hush the noise, ye men of strife.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.340]   And hear the angels sing.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.340]   What are they singing?
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:55.940]   Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of goodwill.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:02.980]   O hush the noise, ye men of strife.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.740]   And hear the angels sing.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:11.220]   For lo, the days are hastening on, by prophet gods foretold.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:18.580]   When with the ever-circling years comes round the age of gold, when peace shall over all
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:29.620]   the earth its ancient splendors fling, and the whole world send back the song which now
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.300]   the angels sing.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.580]   Let us begin to sing it tonight.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   Let's prepare.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.460]   Let's have a rehearsal.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:44.700]   Let's begin to sing this song and send it back.
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.620]   The angels are singing it.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.540]   Let all believe in him.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:55.620]   Join together and begin to sing it here this evening.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.980]   It's here for us in hymn number 88.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:26.020]   It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
