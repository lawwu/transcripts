[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   - Hi, I'm here with Chris Mueller,
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.340]   pastor of Faith Bible Church in Wildermar.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.140]   Chris, you're here for the Shepherds Conference,
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.940]   and you've been reading the LSB a little bit.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.780]   What do you think?
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.900]   - I love the LSB.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.180]   The amazing thing is our congregation,
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.400]   they use three versions,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.860]   and the LSB is growing in favor.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.700]   And they love it.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.940]   It's clear, it's accurate,
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.020]   and what you want is something that reflects the text,
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.540]   and it reflects the text,
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.300]   and does a great job of really making the words,
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660]   not contemporary, but very readable.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660]   Very readable, and very true
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.700]   to the original intention of the text.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.900]   And that's what you want.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.540]   And it's a wonderful version.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.740]   So we love it.
