[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Yes and amen.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   But wouldn't God also be glorified in us if we were just minions, his slavish laborers?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's a question from a listener named Gage.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Pastor John, hello. I just finished reading the first chapter of your book Desiring God.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   After the introduction, I was fired up to read more about Christian hedonism
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and already felt as if I could call your book a paradigm-shifting book for me.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   My confusion hit when I began reading about the happiness of God.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   As you described the chief end of God, I didn't find myself in disbelief.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   If God's chief end is to glorify himself, that is absolutely believable.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Where I am awestruck is the fact that his glorification is his chief end
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and yet he still doesn't require us to live by works to satisfy him.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   My question is this.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Why is it that with God, his chief end being to glorify himself,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   doesn't require us to slave away in works?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Couldn't he be just as glorified in us if we were tireless slaves for him?"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Couldn't he be just as glorified in us if we were tireless slaves for him?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And the answer to that question is easy and clear. No.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   He could not be just as glorified.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   But the best way to come at a question like this is not first to dig into the nature of God
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   to explain why this is so.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   That's what I was frankly tempted to do because it's not hard to do and it's glorious to do it.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   But I think first is to dig into Scripture to show that this is so, not just why it is so.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That he does not seek tireless slaves for him.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Because that will yield, I think, a more biblically sound and solid answer
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   than if we try to jump over concrete texts and just jump to the nature of an all-sufficient God
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   to argue why he doesn't need slave labor.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So let's do that.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   There will be clear answers to the question why God is more glorified
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   when we receive power and blessing from him rather than receiving slave labor from him.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Those answers are coming.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But even if we couldn't answer the question why, the why question,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   it's crucial that we submit to the teaching of Scripture that it is so.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He doesn't need and doesn't use slave labor.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He abhors the idea of being served as a slave who provides the poor needy plantation owner
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   with the labor that he's lacking.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   God does get more glory from our serving freely, by faith, in his enabling power
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   than providing needed slave labor.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So let's look at a few passages and then circle back to the why question,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   why he would be more glorified this way than by tireless slave labor.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   1 Peter 4:11, "Whoever serves, let him serve as one who serves by the strength that God supplies,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So God gets the glory because God gave the strength.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So the giver gets the glory.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   If we were the giver of slave labor and God were the needy plantation owner dependent on us,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   then we would get the glory, our power, and our wisdom, and our resourcefulness providing his need.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That's the gist of the argument in 1 Peter 4:11.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Here's 2 Thessalonians 1, 11, and 12.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "We always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill," get this,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   "fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So God fulfills our good resolves to serve God.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you."
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   So God is glorified because he fulfills every good resolve and work of faith.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   We don't provide his slave labor.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   He provides our strength to give any labor.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That's why he gets the glory according to 2 Thessalonians 1, 12.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Here's Acts 17, 24, and 25.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   "The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   is not served by human hands as though he needed anything,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So God's glory is such that he is not and cannot be served as though he needed anything,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   especially slave labor.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   He's the giver of all, not the receiver.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And then Romans 11, 34, and 35.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Answer, nobody.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Nobody counsels God.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Nobody gives God advice that he doesn't already know.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Verse 35, "Or who has given a gift to God that he might be repaid?"
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Answer, nobody.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You can't negotiate or barter with God.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You can't ever put him in your debt.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   He already has everything.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   If you give him anything, you're giving him what he already owns.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So, verse 36, "From him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   To him be glory forever and ever."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So he gets glory because nobody can give him anything that he doesn't first give to us.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   For all is from him and through him and to him.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The giver gets the glory.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So, God's way of saving us is by faith in his initiative and his gift and his empowerment.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It is decisively from him, through him, to him, beginning to end.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And so Paul says of Abraham in Romans 4, 20,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "Abraham grew strong in his faith, giving glory to God,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Faith in God's promises of provision is how we glorify God,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   not by showing that we have resources for slave labor in ourselves
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   to contribute to God's faltering labor force.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So Jesus says to his disciples, "No longer do I call you slaves."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Not going to call you that.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   "For the slave does not know what his master is doing, but I have called you friends.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   For all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And he makes clear that his glory consists in his being the giver, not the taker.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   John 14, 13, "Whatever you ask, ask, ask," not give,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   "Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So God is glorified by being rich, resourceful, all providing as our giver Father.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So here's the answer to the question.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Couldn't God be just as glorified in us if we were tireless slaves for him?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   No, because having slaves shows a few glories.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Some wealth to purchase the slaves, some power to coerce the service,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   some wisdom to secure the investment.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So there's a kind of glory for the slave master,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   but the fullness of God's glory would never be shown this way.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   His grace, his mercy, his patience, his kindness would not shine that way.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   God knows that he is seen to be more glorious
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   when the beauty of all of his perfections bind us to him,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   not with chains, but with cherishing, not with coercion, but with contentment,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   not because he's a tyrant, but because he's a treasure that we won't leave.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He's not a tyrant that we can't leave.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He's a treasure that we won't leave, and therefore he gets way more glory that way.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   than if he operated by coercion that we had to fulfill against our delights.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   No, God would not get more glory from a tireless slave labor force.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   He gets more glory.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   He gets glory by being so beautiful in his character and in his ways
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   that we are bound to him not because we are held in jail,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   but because we are held by joy.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Amen. That is a beautiful word. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
