[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060]   FU money is the same as being financially independent.
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.960]   Financial independence is when you get to that fully independent stage, and FU money
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   are the steps along the way.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.480]   The moment you begin saving and investing, you now have FU money.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.760]   It's kind of like going to the gym.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100]   The moment you go, you're not going to be bench pressing 300 pounds the next day, but
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.000]   you're a little bit stronger than you were the day before, and that's your FU money.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.680]   The more FU money you have, the bolder you can be.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.280]   A lot of people are intimidated when they start because they say, "Wow, being financially
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.920]   independent at some large amount of invested assets, that feels like a long way off and
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.440]   maybe not even possible."
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.840]   It's not an on-off switch.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.800]   You don't have to wait for the benefits to come to you until you're at that destination.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.280]   The moment you start, you become stronger and better able to make better decisions.
