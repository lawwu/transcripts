[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:14.200]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 4, reading from verse 27 to verse 30.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.080]   And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman; yet no man said,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.600]   What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.840]   The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.020]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Christ?
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.640]   Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.160]   I'm anxious to consider with you, especially this morning, the twenty-eighth verse.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.200]   The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way into the city.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.000]   Now, we are looking at this incident, as most of you will recall.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.680]   In order that we may learn from it, one of the most important lessons we can ever learn
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.600]   in this life and in this world, and that is, how we can obtain what the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.840]   has come into the world to offer to mankind.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.560]   He has come, as he has told this woman, to offer water, whosoever drinketh of the water
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520]   be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.760]   Now, that is the offer of the Christian gospel, or, if you prefer it, of his fullness have
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.520]   we received, and grace upon grace, or, if you prefer it again, I am come that they might
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.320]   have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   Now, this is the Christian faith, this is the Christian message.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   And you see, it is the message that offers us such a life, that we shall never thirst.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   It doesn't matter what happens.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.800]   The Christian has inner resources, he's got an inner peace, he's got an inner satisfaction.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.840]   He never thirsts, never upset by what happens round and about him, never panics, he never
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.120]   thirsts, because he's got this life and life more abundantly within him.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.400]   And as I say, the most important thing for us is to be certain that we have this.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.560]   And if we haven't, to find out why we haven't, to find out how we can obtain this.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.680]   The scriptures are given to us in order that that might be possible.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   The ascended Lord, as we are told by Paul in Ephesians 4, when he had ascended up on
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.400]   high, he gave gifts and amenity to the church, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   teachers.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   What for?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.880]   Well, in order that we might know these things.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.000]   Though, you see, we are born again, we are not perfect, and the world and the flesh and
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.920]   the devil are round and about us and are ever trying to rob us of these things.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.200]   So he has made this wonderful provision for us, that we might see the things that are
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.720]   possible for us, and examine ourselves in the light of it, and then discover, as I say,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.600]   what it is that stands between us and entering into this great possession.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   And then finding, as I say, the way in order to do that.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.920]   Now this woman, this case of this woman of Samaria that we are considering, is most instructive
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   in this respect.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   Thank God for a story, a case like this.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Here's a woman who went, as usual, to the well to draw water, expecting nothing at all
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   to happen.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.560]   The humdrum, ordinary, sordid kind of life that she was living.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.480]   Suddenly, she's confronted by this blessed person, and he speaks to her, and she comes
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.920]   to this realization as to who he is, that he is the Messiah.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.720]   He tells us, "I that speak unto thee am he."
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.520]   So she goes to the city and tells the men of the city, "Come see a man which told me
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.200]   all things that ever I did.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.740]   Is not this the Christ, by which he means this is?
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.740]   He must be.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.080]   He can't be anybody else.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.120]   Come and see him."
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.560]   Well now then, I say that here, through the case of this woman, we can learn many valuable
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   lessons.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   Very many.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.960]   And what we're doing now is to show here, in her reaction to our Lord, the things that
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.160]   are really essential and vital to the obtaining of this well of water.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.440]   And we've seen that she was brought by our Lord to a sense of her own unworthiness.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   She was given a conviction of sin, "See a man who told me all things that ever I did."
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.300]   She was humble.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.040]   She really saw herself for the first time.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.120]   Very difficult to understand this, and yet it's true of all of us.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.600]   Though this woman was living in such terrible sin, she could still justify herself in many
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   ways.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880]   We're all experts at the same thing.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.680]   But the moment we meet our Lord, that comes to an end.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.360]   Self-defense goes.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   Self-righteousness.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.000]   Well, as the Apostle Paul puts it there in Philippians 3, "It all becomes dumb, refuse,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   not worth talking about, ridiculous."
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.680]   So you see, it is partly because we don't see that about our own righteousness, that
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.040]   we are lacking in his righteousness and in his fullness.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.480]   See, there's this great turning point, as the Apostle puts it there, "Not having my
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.120]   own righteousness, which is of the Lord."
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.560]   How could he ever have relied upon that?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.960]   How could he ever have boasted in that as he had been doing?
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   He sees it all, it's nonsense.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.240]   He wants that righteousness which is of God, by faith in Jesus Christ, the only thing that's
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   worth talking about.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   Well now, this is obviously a very vital point, and the woman brings this out quite clearly
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   in her own way and in her own language.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.920]   That is a very common cause.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.840]   We've got to abandon ourselves to him, let him handle the situation.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.200]   If you resist him in any way, if you come, as we were showing last Sunday morning, with
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.800]   your demands, well, you won't get anything.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.080]   You've just got to come realizing that you don't know what to ask for.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.560]   And therefore, leave yourselves in his hands and let him speak to you and let him deal
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   with you.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   He will do so, he's promised to.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.040]   And what he did for the woman, he will do for us.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.160]   Thank God he does this, if we only allow him to do so.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   But this isn't the only obstacle.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.620]   There's another thing here, and I want to call attention to this this morning.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.600]   Another thing that often stands between us and the realization of this fullness that
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:03.360]   he has come to give us, is that our whole notion and idea of the Christian life is defective,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   inadequate.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:12.720]   I mean by that, that though we may see clearly this question of our guilt, and may see the
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.000]   utter folly and uselessness of ever trying to justify ourselves by our works or our understanding
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.620]   or anything else, we may see clearly this whole question of the need of justification
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.140]   by faith only and regeneration and so on, and still have very defective views of the
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.700]   true character and nature of the Christian life.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.420]   And this, I suppose, is one of the main causes of our trouble.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.900]   The instinct of safety, a desire for safety, self-preservation, tends to make us realize
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.160]   the problem of forgiveness acutely.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.340]   But then we tend to stop at that, we are saved, and so we stay there.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.220]   You notice how frequently in these New Testament epistles, the various writers, not only the
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.800]   Apostle Paul, but the others as well, are constantly reprimanding the people to whom
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.960]   they were writing, because they were remaining as babes in Christ.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.800]   They were not going on, they were not going on to perfection, they were not exercising
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.840]   their senses, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, to understand these
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   things.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.480]   And so the Apostles and the writers had to keep on dealing with the first principles
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.040]   of the Gospel of Christ, the danger of staying there and not realizing the tremendous and
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.480]   the glorious possibilities of this life into which he has brought us.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.520]   Well now, here again you see we are helped by this woman.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.240]   And I see it in this 28th verse where we are told that the woman then left her water pot
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.920]   and went her way into the city.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   But it is very important that we should understand exactly what she did and why she did it.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   Now one tends instinctively to imagine that what happened here was this, that the woman
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.000]   was having this conversation with our Lord and he had just spoken to her about himself,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.480]   then the disciples suddenly appeared.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.280]   And seeing the disciples come, the woman got excited and rushed back to the city forgetting
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   her water pot.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.740]   Now I think that is a complete misunderstanding of what this woman did.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.360]   This is not a case of excitement in that sense, it is not a case of forgetfulness.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   I think I can prove that.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.640]   She went to the men into the city and said to the men, "Come, see a man which told
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.520]   me all things that ever I did.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.700]   Is not this the Christ?"
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.680]   Now she did not say, "Go," she said, "Come."
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.160]   In other words, she deliberately leaves her water pot there, goes to the city to invite
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.960]   these people to come, and takes them back with her.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   That was her whole intention.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.800]   She had not forgotten her water pot.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.400]   She was not just carried away, as it were, and not realizing what she was doing, suddenly
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.840]   rushes back to the city.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:13.520]   No, no, she does this thing quite deliberately, leaves the water pot and goes and extends
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.480]   her invitation to her fellow townsmen and brings them back with her.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.560]   Now, why, why, what does this teach us?
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.200]   Well, here it seems to me that we are led to this principle that I am anxious to enunciate
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.680]   this morning.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:36.880]   The fact of the matter was, this woman had undergone a complete and a radical change.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   All her values have changed, everything has changed.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.120]   She had become a different person.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.600]   Her life, hitherto, had been a life of sin and a life of drudgery.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.760]   The daily chores of the household, especially this business of going to fetch water to the
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.080]   well back and forth, and as is undoubtedly the case, she would have to do so at a time
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.400]   when the sun was shining in the heavens.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.880]   She did not like to go when other people were about.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.760]   She knew what they thought of her and what they were saying about her.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   So she had to go in the blazing sun to get this water back and forth.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.200]   But now something has happened to this woman and everything has changed.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.680]   And this comes out, it seems to me, in her deliberately leaving her water pot there and
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.920]   doing something else.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.120]   In other words, you see, she had gone there to get the water.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.680]   That was on her mind, that was one of the big things in her life, no longer is this
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   the case.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.160]   There's a revolution and she leaves her water pot, goes and fetches the people and
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.320]   brings them.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.960]   This is a tremendous change and it leads us to see a number of things which are always
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.040]   true about this Christian life of ours.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.600]   And so we must examine ourselves in the light of this.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.780]   So I would say the first, let me put some negative points first.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:07.960]   The Christian life is not merely a slight modification of our lives, it's not just
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:16.040]   a slight change in our lives, it is a complete change.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   Nothing stands out so clearly about this woman as just that very fact.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.560]   She's an entirely different person when she goes back to that city from what she was
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   when she'd left it to go to the well to fetch the water.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.240]   Now, as you know, the New Testament is full of this.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   Our Lord has already put it to Nicodemus, "You must be born again."
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.400]   That is the essential truth about this Christian faith, this Christian position of ours.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.120]   It is indeed a life, and that's the thing that comes out so clearly, that's the thing
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:55.240]   our Lord has told us, it's a well of water within you, springing up into everlasting
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   life.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   Well, let's put it like this, and this is where it seems to me it comes to us in a very
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.160]   searching manner.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:10.320]   The life of the Christian is not like the life of everybody else, with just this one
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.120]   difference that he has this interest, which comes in.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.440]   You look at him, and you come to the conclusion, "Well, he's a man like everybody else.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.880]   He's got the same interests, he's got the same pursuits.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.800]   Six days of the week he's like everybody else, but he does this odd thing on the seventh
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.040]   day, the Sabbath, the first day of the week, whichever it is.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:38.440]   The point is that six days out of seven he's like everybody else, but this odd day he just
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.080]   shows a slight difference."
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:47.360]   Now, isn't this true so often of many of us in this Christian life?
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.440]   You look at this person, and you're rather surprised and amazed that he or she is a Christian.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.480]   I can't remember whether I ever told you the story of what a man once told me, who had
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.080]   not long become a Christian himself, and he'd been ill afterwards, and he was advised to
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.400]   take a cruise in the Mediterranean for the sake of his health, and he and his wife had
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.160]   gone, and there they were, and the Sunday came, and going down to breakfast they noticed
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.720]   the notice board, and that there was an announcement that at eleven o'clock the captain of the
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.440]   ship would be holding a service in the lounge, and they were delighted at this.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.640]   This was something that thrilled them.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.800]   So they went down to the table, they were seated with a number of other people, and
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.320]   they'd been talking to them since they'd gone on board, and they immediately said,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.680]   "Oh, God, they were to notice that there was to be a service at eleven o'clock."
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.040]   And to their utter astonishment and amazement, a lady sitting at the same table with them,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.240]   and whom they'd got to know the previous days, expressed her great delight also, and
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.280]   how much she was looking forward to it.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.600]   Why were they surprised at her saying this?
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.400]   Well, the answer was that it had never occurred to them that she was a Christian, never, in
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.240]   her conversation, her appearance, her demeanor, her everything.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.680]   It comes as a shock to them to find that this woman is a Christian, as they have recently
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.160]   become Christians themselves.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.720]   Now, that's an extreme example of it, perhaps, but isn't this so often true, that the main
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:24.120]   tenor of our lives is like the life of everybody else, but we add on this.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   This comes in.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.600]   It doesn't seem to be an essential, central part of it, but it's an addendum, an appendix,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.360]   an addition to our lives.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.040]   Now, this, I say, is something that is quite foreign to the New Testament picture of the
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.400]   Christian.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:48.600]   That isn't the Christian at all, or, let me put it like this, far too often we give
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   the impression that the Christian faith and our Christianity is nothing but some sort
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.240]   of a break upon our lives.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:06.840]   I mean in a moral sense, mainly, that we are doing what everybody else does, and then we
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.600]   suddenly won't do something, and these people are amazed, they're astonished at us.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.200]   "Why won't you do this?" they say.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.240]   They never thought that we were different, but just this odd point comes now and again
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.360]   when a break is put on, and we are held back, we are held in, and we can't, but it doesn't
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.560]   occur to these people that we are essentially different.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:35.840]   This seems to be an oddity to them, some sort of expressiveness, and they're perplexed
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   by this.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.320]   Perplexed, not so much that we don't do this particular thing, as that this seems
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.920]   to be a contradiction to their estimate of our lives, an oddity.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.560]   Far too often we give people the impression that to be Christian is to be an odd person,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:00.400]   because there isn't a wholeness about our life and about our whole demeanour.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:08.320]   Or another way in which we can put this, selfsame point is this, that far too often our Christianity
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.360]   seems to be something of which we have to remind ourselves, we have to pull ourselves
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.800]   up and remind ourselves that we are Christians, or perhaps indeed we may be in such a state
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.640]   and a condition that other things have to pull us up.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.960]   I've often been told this by people, and I'm sure it's true to all our experiences,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.200]   an illness or a sickness or something, pulls us up sharply, and we are reminded of how
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.240]   we've been going on assuming our Christianity, but forgetting it in a sense.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.880]   Fundamentally, if we'd been questioned or examined, we'd be all right and we'd
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   give the right answers, but in our life, in our daily living, in our regular course,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.480]   it really had more or less not been there, and our life might have been the life of anybody
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.600]   else who wasn't a Christian, but suddenly we are reminded of it.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.800]   Oh, how often does this happen?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.160]   And you see, the New Testament tells us this, that God himself has to chastise us at times
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.520]   because we are his children, and the Lord loveth he chastened, and if we won't give
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.640]   a positive obedience, he will employ other methods in order to remind us of who we are
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.240]   and our relationship to him, and the fact that the whole glory of his gospel is in our
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.160]   hands, as it were, and that it is being tarnished.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   Now this is another way, therefore, in which we fail to demonstrate clearly the essential
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.760]   character of the Christian life.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   Or another way in which I can put it again is this.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.040]   Is our Christianity something that we take up as a duty?
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:52.720]   Ah yes, there it is, and it's a duty, and we have to perhaps force ourselves to do it,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.680]   force ourselves to carry out the duty.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.000]   There is that in us that doesn't want to do this, but after all, we are Christians
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.040]   and therefore we've got to do this.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:11.360]   Now this is so often true, isn't it, that we give the impression it's a sort of burden,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.680]   it's a kind of weight which we're carrying, it's a duty.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.840]   In other words, we've turned it into a law, and we give the impression very often that
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:27.520]   it's against the grain, and we just have to make ourselves do this, and then we take
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.080]   credit to ourselves because we've done it, we've carried out our duty.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:39.160]   Now this is a kind of mechanical religion, and we take it up and we put it down and we
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.080]   force ourselves to do it, and we as I say feel we really have done very well and very
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.440]   wonderfully because we have carried out certain religious duties, attendance at the house
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.120]   of God or something else, and if other things of course, well yes, and so we go on.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.840]   Now this is, I say, the opposite of what is illustrated here and what is taught everywhere
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   in the New Testament, or let me put it finally under this negative heading.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.000]   Is it merely a vague general influence?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   And something about which we're not quite clear and which we don't quite understand?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.880]   In other words, I'm asking this one big question.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.720]   What is the place and the position of your Christian faith in your life?
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.860]   That's the one big question.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:33.560]   I've subdivided it in order to make it more obvious, but it really all comes to this.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.540]   Where does this exactly come in my life?
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.680]   Is it only in the appendix, or is it right through the whole book?
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.080]   Now here is the thing I say, that I see so clearly in the case of this woman.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.640]   She's an illustration of our Lord's teaching about the rebirth, about being born again.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:06.080]   Here is a woman who's been changed entirely, there's a radical, central change.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.680]   And of course, the change is due, we must go on to find out as a second principle, the
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:20.040]   change is entirely due to the fact that her life is now dominated by our Lord.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.400]   You see, until this point, she was in control of her life, I mean, in the sense that she
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.560]   did what she did.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.520]   In her work, she had to do it, and she thought about it, and she did it in this way.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.560]   She'd gone from home with the intention of filling that water pot again, and taking
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.160]   it back and going on with the work in the house.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.520]   She'd got her program.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.680]   Then she'd got her pleasure and her unworthiness and all the rest of it.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.480]   But she had got her program, and she lived according to her program.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.120]   Suddenly her program is completely upset.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.520]   She leaves her water pot, does something else, she's got time.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   Why?
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.320]   Well, a revolution has taken place, her whole outlook upon everything, water pots and everything
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.400]   else is entirely changed.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   What's changed it?
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.200]   And that is the answer.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.880]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ himself who changes it.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.600]   And this is this great central theme of the New Testament.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:27.360]   He determines our lives, he controls our lives, he dominates our lives in every respect, when
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.520]   we really are in this position to which he would have us come.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.240]   Now this is the thing, it seems to me, that differentiates once more between religion
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   and Christianity.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:47.220]   Now, you see, our Lord in the days of his flesh was always making this kind of demand.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:55.640]   You remember how he constantly would look at a man and he'd say to him, "Follow me."
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.760]   And he meant by that that the man had to leave what he was doing.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.920]   He said, "Follow me," to Peter and Andrew and so on, these fishermen, they were with
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.800]   their father, washing their nets and mending the boat and so on.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.080]   Suddenly our Lord comes and says, "Follow me."
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   They leave their father and the boats and the nets and everything else, and they go
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   after him.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.260]   Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, that was his job, he was earning his living,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.260]   "Follow me."
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.180]   He gets up and he leaves it all.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.660]   Now this was our Lord's demand.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.280]   It was a totalitarian demand, always.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.340]   And you notice, the point I'm emphasizing is, that it isn't merely a question of taking
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.540]   up his teaching and trying to implement it and to put it into practice.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.380]   He goes beyond that.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:49.000]   You see, you and I can take up teachings, and that is the grave danger, that we treat
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.860]   the Christian faith in that way.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.380]   It's something we take up, as I say, and put down again, remind ourselves of it, do
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.660]   certain duties, then leave it, and then the rest of our lives is exactly the same as everybody
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   else's.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   Now that's not what he wants.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.980]   That's not what he'll have.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.020]   "Follow me."
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:16.060]   If any man would be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up the cross, and follow me.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.300]   He's the leader, he's the director, he's the author and the finisher of the faith, and
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.140]   we follow him.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.820]   He controls the life, he dominates the life.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:32.260]   And it's obvious in the case of this woman, that her whole life now has been changed entirely,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.020]   and she's dominated by this blessed person.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.940]   Water pots, what are water pots?
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.940]   It's this.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.940]   Come and see this man.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.940]   There's time for that.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.180]   That'll come in its own place.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.420]   Oh, there are many, many illustrations of this.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.860]   If you like, you see it perfectly in two other women, and the contrast between them, Martha
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.860]   and Mary.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:59.020]   There it is, very perfectly, Martha busy about many things, coming and going, making food,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.220]   Mary sitting at the feet of the Master.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.860]   Of course, it's important to be hospitable, and to prepare food, and to be kind, and so
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.860]   on.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:15.500]   But you see, when he's there, there's something more important, and you sit at his feet instead
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.060]   of fussing and bothering.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.940]   One thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.500]   Well now, here it is, I say, coming out clearly in the case of this woman, and you get the
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.540]   same thing coming out in the teaching of the great apostle.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:39.700]   Look at how he puts it in writing to the Galatians, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.980]   Nevertheless, I live.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:49.580]   A life I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.740]   and gave himself for me."
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.980]   "Christ," he says, again making it plain and clear, "liveth in me.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:03.740]   I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.660]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:14.220]   loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.380]   And again, you remember the great statement in the first chapter of that epistle to the
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:23.660]   Philippians, "To me to live is Christ."
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.420]   He says, "This is life for me, this is the essence of life for me."
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.580]   He's not somebody I remember now and again, he's not somebody whose teaching I'm trying
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:38.660]   painfully to put into practice, he's my life, he dominates my life.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:48.540]   Now, someone once said that Paul was a Christ-intoxicated man, and it's a very good expression, Christ-intoxicated.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.060]   But you know the apostle, he's got a better way of putting it himself, he likes to call
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:59.460]   himself the bond-slave of Jesus Christ, the bond-slave.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:05.580]   The servant, this authorised version translates it, it means not only slave, but bond-slave.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:11.980]   I'm not my own, he's dominated by his master, his owner, he belongs to him.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.940]   This is his great way of putting it.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.060]   In other words, though he has all this genius, and though he was a very self-willed man as
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.020]   a natural man, as he may explain in that bit of autobiography which we read out of Philippians
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:31.220]   3, this is the astounding thing that happens to this man, this determined, self-righteous,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:40.940]   brilliant man, he comes as a little child, and his whole life is dominated by the Lord
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.940]   Jesus Christ.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.820]   Well now, here is the thing I say that emerges out of the action of this woman.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.420]   This tremendous change has taken place, and so she shows it in the thing that is most
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.220]   characteristic of her, of course.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.260]   Her life, in a sense, had been dominated hitherto by the water-pot.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.180]   The demands, the needs, these are the things that governed her life.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.380]   We all know about this, don't we?
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.860]   What governs your life?
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.740]   Ask yourself for a moment, what is it that determines your life?
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.020]   How are you going to live this next week?
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.020]   What decides it?
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.020]   What determines it?
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:24.980]   And we soon discover, I think, that we become the victims, the slaves of habits and of customs
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.780]   and of duties and all these things.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.220]   Now, you don't misunderstand this, of course, this woman didn't leave her water-pot there
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   permanently.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.140]   No, no, life has to go on, and we've got to live, and we've got our duties to do.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.780]   All I'm saying is this, that the relative position changes.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.860]   The water-pot no longer dominates, doesn't determine.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:49.760]   Something else, she, rather than the water-pot, and she because of he.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   And here it is.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:58.620]   Now, I want to show you something of this radical and profound change that takes place.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.660]   What I'm trying to show is that the central control of life changes, that it isn't something
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.180]   added on, it isn't the cloak that you put on, it isn't the bag you take up, it isn't
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.060]   something that comes in spasmodically, periodically, fits and starts.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.060]   No, no.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:22.820]   It's a well of water within you, springing up into everlasting life, and so fractifying
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.220]   everything and making a difference to everything which it controls.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.620]   Well, now, how does this show itself?
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.940]   Well, of course, the first way in which it shows itself is this.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:42.300]   It shows a change in our mind, and in our outlook, and in our thinking.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.820]   You remember again how the Apostle Paul puts it in the second chapter of the first epistle
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.820]   to the Corinthians.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.220]   He says, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.580]   It's one of the most amazing things he ever said.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.860]   And you remember he says that in the sixteenth last verse of the second chapter of the first
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.220]   epistle to the Corinthians, because it's a climax.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:10.020]   He says, "He that is spiritual judgeth, understands all these things, yet he himself is judged
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.020]   of no man."
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.420]   He's become a problem and an enigma, he's a changed person, and he's got an understanding
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.420]   of these spiritual things, the natural man hasn't, he's just been saying that the spiritual
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.420]   man has.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.340]   He says, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.100]   But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.580]   Now, what does he mean by that?
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:35.700]   Well, you see, he means by that, that the Lord Jesus Christ dominates our thinking.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.780]   The Christian does not think any longer as he used to think, he doesn't think as other
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.780]   people think.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:48.820]   Now, this, first and foremost, of course, applies to our way of looking at things.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.180]   Again, you remember the Apostle in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, verses
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.260]   five and six, he contrasts, "They that are of the flesh, and they that are of the Spirit."
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.340]   This is the fundamental difference about which I'm speaking.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.200]   By nature, we are all of the flesh, and we think according to the flesh, let him say
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   it.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.700]   "They that are after the flesh, do mind think of the things of the flesh."
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   Not only that, they think in a fleshly way, "But they that are after the Spirit, the things
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:25.260]   of the Spirit, for to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.620]   and peace, because the carnal mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.260]   God, neither, indeed, can be."
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.420]   You see, one of the first things that happens is a complete change of mind.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.860]   "Yes," says Paul again, "you have been renewed in the very spirit of your mind."
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:48.380]   Now, this is a tremendous thing, and it is because of this that the whole life is changed.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.940]   The whole thinking is entirely changed.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.100]   It's a new type of thinking.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:02.540]   So we ask ourselves this simple question, "Am I aware of this different type of thinking?
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.940]   Do I see everything in this world in a different way from the men of the world?
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.600]   If I'm a Christian, I should.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.660]   It should be quite clear to me.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.940]   My whole outlook is different."
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:20.420]   Again, you see, you've got it in the change that took place in this Apostle Paul.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.300]   Look at the things he used to boast of.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.900]   Look at the change.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.740]   "If all things were gain to me, then I can't but loss."
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.300]   Now, you can't argue with a thing like this.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.400]   It's something that happens.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.980]   You see, by nature, we're all out for the world, and the world appeals to us.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.980]   What the world has got is so wonderful, it's so marvellous, and look at the way people
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.900]   get excited about it all.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.460]   But you know, the Christian doesn't.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.060]   The Christian knows, as the Apostle John puts it in his first epistle of the second chapter,
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:59.540]   "Friendship of the world is enmity against God.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.780]   The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, it's not of God."
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.140]   He says, "It belongs to the world."
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.540]   And so you see, the Christian looks at everything.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.260]   He thinks in a new way.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.660]   It's a new type of thinking.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.540]   You're amazed at yourself when you find yourself doing this.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.460]   You don't have to force yourself to do it.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.700]   You don't have to make yourself do it.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:28.020]   You don't suddenly put down one lot of spectacles, as it were, and put up another.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   No, no.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   It's there, and it comes out.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.100]   But I'm anxious to put it in this form also, that it's not merely a different way of looking
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   at things, but it is indeed a considering of all things in terms of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:54.380]   Now, we use this term "Christian" sometimes in a very loose way.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.100]   People talk about Christendom, Christian culture, and so on.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.700]   I know in a sense they're right, but it can be a very great danger.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.380]   You see, there is a kind of Christian philosophy, but the thing that you get in the New Testament
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.620]   is not a Christian philosophy.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:16.460]   It is a mind and an outlook dominated by the Lord himself.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:24.260]   And that, in turn, means that the man in his thinking is viewing and regarding all things
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.620]   in the light of the fact of the Lord and of his coming and of what he's done and where
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.980]   he is and what he's yet going to do.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:38.180]   This dominates the whole of our lives and all our thinking.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:43.020]   It will show itself in a big detail in the life of the woman of Samaria, the water pot
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.500]   and the place of the water pot in her life.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.340]   But this is only one illustration of it.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.220]   The whole outlook is entirely changed.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:35:02.620]   And so we examine ourselves, do we view all things in the light of the facts which we
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.340]   believe concerning our blessed Lord?
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:11.260]   Do we look at this world this morning, this country of ours this morning, as the world
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.780]   looks at it?
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:19.500]   Or do we look at it in the light of the Lord himself, what he has done, what he's yet
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   going to do?
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   How do we react to things that happen?
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.260]   It's a very good test.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:31.380]   There's a fundamental difference between the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:36.780]   The Christian does not set his affection on things that are on the earth.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.180]   Set your affections on things above, not on things which are on the earth.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.260]   And it's because of that that the Christian is not so moved by the things that happen
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.260]   as other people.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.060]   He develops a relative immunity to the things that happen round about him.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:56.020]   His heart is fixed, trusting and knowing the Lord.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.020]   He doesn't become panicky.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.980]   There is a stability about him.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.860]   You see, he knows the world, he's seen through it.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.620]   The Lord has opened his eyes.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.900]   He sees through it.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.380]   He sees it for what it is.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.580]   He sees beyond it.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.940]   He doesn't expect too much in this world, and therefore he's not so much disappointed
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   when he doesn't get it.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.400]   Now then, this is something which the Apostles are constantly pressing.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.260]   You see, that's why in all their writings they always start with doctrine.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.220]   Then having laid down the great doctrine, then as Paul does in Romans 12, they go on
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.940]   to say, "I beseech you therefore, brother, by the mercies of God, that you present your
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:38.620]   bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   and be not conformed to this world."
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.900]   Now that's first, remember, in your thinking.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:56.820]   Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.620]   prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.460]   This is it, this transformation.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.980]   And so the Christian is no longer conformed to this world.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.300]   Now that doesn't only refer to the body and what you put on it and what you put in
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.540]   it and what you do with it, it does include that in detail.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.620]   You present your bodies a living sacrifice, but it governs the whole of your thinking.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.580]   You're not conformed to it in any sense, in your political thinking or in any other.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.220]   You don't get excited about politics if you're a Christian.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.780]   Now I'm not denouncing politics.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.580]   Politics is essential.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.580]   Government is essential.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:41.540]   The powers that be are ordained of God, and whether it's monarchy or whether it's
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.940]   republic or democracy, aristocracy, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.940]   Government is essential.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.900]   But what I am saying is this, the Christian never gets excited about it.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:57.140]   He doesn't pin his faith to it, and he's not disappointed when things go wrong.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.900]   He knows that this is a world of sin.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.020]   He understands the problem of this country today in a way that nobody else does.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.780]   It isn't a quarrel between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.500]   It's the same thing in both.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.540]   It's that nobody believes in work.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:19.180]   Everybody's out for pleasure, whether he's the owner or the worker.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.300]   He's got other interests, and money is just a means for him to get his pleasure.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.500]   It's the same thing in all.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.060]   Nobody wants to work, but each blames the other for not doing it, of course.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:36.620]   The Christian sees through both, and he knows that all our fundamental problems are due
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:42.780]   to the fact that man is selfish, in sin, that he's lawless, that he's disobedient.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.220]   Ah yes, you can get excited, perhaps, if you hold a certain set of views about the lawlessness
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.780]   of the trade unions, but what about the lawlessness of the whole of mankind to God?
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.100]   It's the same thing exactly, except that it is infinitely worse.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.100]   That's the only difference.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.460]   How easily we condemn others.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.540]   But the Christian is a man who sees it in its totality.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:13.060]   He sees everything in the light of this blessed Lord who's come into the world, and he came
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.420]   because the world was in such a rotten condition that nothing else and no one else could possibly
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.420]   save it.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.980]   He's come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.180]   The world is in such a desperate plight.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:31.780]   Now this man sees that, his mind has been renewed, he's not conformed to the world
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:39.660]   in any sense whatsoever, or as Paul puts it in Ephesians 4, you are not so learned Christ.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.580]   He says you shouldn't walk, you shouldn't live any longer as other Gentiles walk.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.700]   You lived like that when you were a Gentile, but you're no longer that, you're different.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.900]   You are not so learned Christ, if you have heard him.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.340]   He says, you know, I'm beginning to be doubtful about you.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:00.420]   The way you think, the way you speak, the way you live, have you really heard Christ?
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.620]   Have you really learned from him?
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.900]   Now this is a complete change, you see, in the mind, but I want to show also how it is
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.660]   a complete change in the interests.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.020]   This is very clear in the case of this woman, isn't it?
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:24.940]   This, what a change in her interests, water pot, family, all that she had to do, domestic
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.620]   duties, interests, these were the things that dominated her life and her sinful manner of
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.900]   living and all the drudgery and all the rest of it, but now the whole thing is entirely
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.900]   changed.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:42.860]   And as I say, she shows it at once, she leaves her water pot, she goes to the city, brings
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:49.220]   the men back with her, why, well, she says, my interest now is in him.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.180]   He is what matters, that can wait.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.900]   This is the thing, the modern phrase puts it so well, doesn't it, what are your priorities?
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.600]   And is he always first, and does he dominate everything else?
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:09.780]   To the Christian, he is the main interest in life, the main interest.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.980]   Now this shows itself in many ways, look what we are told about the very first converts
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.940]   on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:22.780]   Here were people, they had known many a previous day of Pentecost, and here comes another day
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.740]   of Pentecost, of course, an important festival, but they had no idea as to what was going
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.740]   to happen to them.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.740]   They were part of the mob, the crowd that had cried a few weeks before concerning our
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:39.380]   blessed Lord, away with him, crucify him, but now they suddenly hear a great commotion.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.620]   These men who used to follow that Jesus, something has happened to them, and there they are standing
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.860]   up, and one of them is preaching, and they begin to listen.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.380]   And as they listen, they are convicted, for he tells them that they have crucified the
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.780]   Son of God, that they by wicked hands and through wicked men have crucified the Lord
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:00.080]   of glory, that they and their rulers are guilty of the most terrible crime, the greatest enormity
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.300]   ever committed by mankind, and suddenly they are convicted of this, and they see it, and
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:09.940]   they cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:16.280]   They are given the answer, and they become entirely changed, entirely changed, three
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   thousand of them.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.940]   And what do they do?
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:24.460]   Well, you see, immediately they do the very thing that this woman does, they give evidence
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.900]   that their whole life has been changed.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:33.420]   There is a new evaluation of everything, there is a new orientation, there is a difference
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.340]   in the centre, and it shows itself everywhere.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:43.300]   So what we are told about them is this, that they continued steadfastly, every day, in
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.780]   the apostles' doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayer, you read
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.420]   that at the end of the second chapter of Acts, and daily we are told in every house and in
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:58.460]   the temple they met to meet bread, and to talk about these things, daily, it was the
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.100]   big thing in their lives.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.500]   They did not think they had done wonderfully if they went to church once on a Sunday, or
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.740]   perhaps once a month, or something like that, and they did not have to be driven, and cajoled,
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.040]   and regarded as sheep, no, no, you could not keep them away, it was the one dominating
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.180]   interest of their lives, it governed everything.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.180]   This is Christianity.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:23.940]   That is just in another shape and form, the very thing that we see so clearly here in
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:31.980]   the case of this woman, and again go back and look at the great apostle, what a revolution!
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.740]   The old things become done and lost, but what is his desire?
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:43.420]   That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.020]   He was a very busy man, remember, travelling, preaching, organising churches, working with
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.900]   his own hands as a tent-maker, never did a man work harder in this world, but there he
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.660]   is, this is the dominating thing, that I may know him.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:05.820]   This is his interest, the Christian's saving interest, or if you like it negatively, the
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:15.620]   Christian is unlike Denis, who has loved this present world more than the Lord and the things
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.420]   that belong to him and to his kingdom.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:24.220]   All you see, it shows itself very clearly in this entire change in all one's interests,
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.780]   and then you get it in exactly the same way in the realm of the will.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.900]   The will is dominated by him in exactly the same way, and you don't have to force yourself
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.320]   and have difficulty in doing so.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:43.940]   It is such a relationship that the will is won over, it is what the Christian desires
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:50.340]   to do and wants to do and enjoys doing, of course the will, likewise as everything else,
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.580]   is dominated by the Lord.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:57.060]   Again, look at the Apostle Paul, his very conversion on the road to Damascus, the first
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:02.420]   thing in a sense which he says is, "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?"
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:07.380]   Until then, he had always decided, "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.820]   things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth," and it was he who decided to go down from
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.340]   Jerusalem to Damascus.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:19.620]   He was always deciding, he was in control, he ruled his own will, "What wilt thou have
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.860]   me to do, Lord?"
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:31.180]   He's almost afraid to do anything, he's made such tragic mistakes, he wants to know his
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.180]   will.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:40.460]   "Only to do thy will my will shall be, thy way, not mine, O Lord, however hard it be."
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:46.420]   And finally, there is this complete revolution also in the realm of the heart and of the
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   feelings.
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.260]   Don't you see it in the case of this woman?
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.580]   The woman left her water pot, deliberately.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.340]   See her rushing off to the city.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.620]   Woman left her water pot and went her way into the city and saith to the men, "Come,
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:08.860]   see a man which told me all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ?"
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.100]   That's not doing a duty, is it?
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.580]   That's not mechanically saying that you're a Christian?
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.380]   No, no, it's the extreme opposite.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.380]   Can't you see her?
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.180]   Can't you picture her?
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   Can't you see her rushing?
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.040]   Can't you see the animation in her face?
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.940]   Can't you hear it in the tone of her voice?
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:35.020]   There is an excitement about it, and I don't see how a man can be truly a Christian without
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.020]   being excited about it.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:42.780]   There's a thrill, there's a passion, there's a feeling.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.220]   If you really believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you don't do it merely intellectually.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.460]   You can't do it without any movement of your heart.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:55.980]   If you know him, well, this woman, she's excited about him, "Come, see a man which told me
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.100]   all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ?"
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.380]   It's thrilling, it's exciting, it's moving.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:09.300]   But unless our hearts are moved, my dear friends, are we Christians at all?
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:14.820]   This idea that our Christianity is a duty, and that we're rather pleased with ourselves
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.540]   when we haven't done some things and when we've done others, you know, it's almost a
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   contradiction of Christianity.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:28.040]   If you're not moved by it and thrilled by it, if it isn't to you the most wonderful thing
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.740]   on earth and the most wonderful thing in heaven to know him and to belong to him, I say you'd
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.980]   better examine yourself again.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   You remember, I've often quoted it, that statement of Count Zinzendorf, "I have one passion.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:52.620]   It is he, and he alone."
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:59.340]   May God give us such a knowledge of him that we shall be able to say the same thing honestly.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:09.500]   The mind, the interest, the understanding, the will, the heart, the passion, all captivated
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   by him.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:17.260]   Let us sing a hymn that will be a prayer expressing such a desire.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:40.220]   Hymn number 443, 443, "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all things else receive."
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:59.900]   "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all things else receive."
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:11.220]   "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all things else receive."
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.140]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
