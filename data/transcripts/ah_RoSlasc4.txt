[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   Let's talk about how to get to a win-win.
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.780]   Win-win is just great collaboration.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.500]   I mean, in point of fact, it should be win-win, which might only be emotional win-win.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.380]   Now, the phraseology win-win, I know that if someone opens a negotiation with me and
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960]   they say right off the bat, look, I want to do a win-win deal with you, that correlates
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.680]   extremely highly with someone who's trying to pick my pocket.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.400]   So if you use that phrase in the first five minutes, I already know where you're coming
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   from.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.400]   You're trying to get me to drop my guard.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.480]   It's you win, I lose.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.960]   And this came up on an Instagram post I put up recently, which is essentially watch out
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240]   for the person that says win-win.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.600]   Now, I didn't say win-win is bad.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.000]   I said watch out for the person that says it.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.680]   Also, you got to be cautious if you like some of the win-win mindset, then people set themselves
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.400]   up to just get slaughtered by the person who's expressing a desire for win-win and looking
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   to pick their pocket.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.120]   Like if I feel win-win in my heart, you go, let's do a win-win deal.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.280]   If I don't watch it, I'm like, OK, what do you want?
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.200]   And then I find myself giving away the store.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   So there's a lot behind the win-win phraseology that you have to have a complete understanding
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   of.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.000]   In point of fact, both sides should feel good about the outcome.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.920]   And isn't that the definition of win-win?
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.280]   Well, kind of, sort of.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.440]   But it's how they feel about it more than really what they got.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.720]   So in a benevolent negotiation among friends, where are we going to go to eat?
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.800]   Where are we going on vacation?
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.560]   What route are we going to take?
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.320]   People really just want to be heard out more than anything else, which operationally seems
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.760]   to be-- I don't understand how it's going to make any difference.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   Makes all the difference in the world.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.800]   And what's the best way for somebody to feel heard out?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.920]   Well, I'm going to start out by telling you-- describing to you, not telling you, but describing
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.280]   to you what my best guess is on your perspective.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.320]   Because it's really calibrating me, actually finding out where your position is.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.360]   And the only way I can find out where your position actually is, I'm going to increase
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.160]   you telling me if I start taking a guess at it first.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.040]   Because you're immediately, right away, you're immediately going to tell me either I'm right
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   or I'm wrong.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.120]   You're going to correct me.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   Correction is a satisfying thing to do.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.520]   And you're going to be much more candid with me.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.760]   If you're correcting me than if I'm asking you.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.240]   And you'll feel good about correcting me.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.600]   So it's going to-- there's all these great emotional lubricants to me getting you to
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   correct me.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.800]   So I'm going to start out by saying like, here's what I think you're thinking.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.840]   Here's how I think you're approaching this.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.520]   Here's what I think you're wanting out of this.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.920]   Not what you should be, but what you probably are based on your perspective.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   And that's going to accelerate the conversation exponentially.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   Like it's ridiculous how much faster things are going to go.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.520]   And then it becomes both an information gathering and a rapport building process simultaneously
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.720]   instead of separately, which is what makes this approach faster, even though it seems
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.240]   more indirect.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.400]   So if we're getting ready to-- let's say you and I are going to take a car trip to San
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Francisco from here.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.800]   And I'm going to say, all right, so my guess is you want to take the most direct route
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.600]   because you hate wasting time.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.480]   And you're probably going to say to me, no, no, no, no, I want to go up the Pacific Coast
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.760]   Highway because it's a beautiful stretch of country.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.200]   Like I realize it's going to be a waste of time if we go up the Pacific Coast because
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.880]   we've got to jump off it at some point, but I really want to see the scenery.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.400]   You would have-- I've taken a guess of what you want, and you're going to come back real
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.200]   quick and correct me.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And then maybe I'm thinking time on the trip, but I've forgotten how beautiful it is to
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.360]   roll up the coast.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.600]   And so when you throw that out, I'll be like, oh, yeah, it is a beautiful ride, and we might
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.160]   not get another shot.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.360]   Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.100]   So yeah, now that we're having a conversation, I'd rather run up the Pacific Coast Highway
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.840]   before we go inland and make the trip.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.280]   And that's how we get to-- we collaborate for a better outcome, maybe a better idea
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.520]   than what I had in mind in the first place.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.920]   I love that because what you just described is hypothesis testing.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.960]   It's the way scientists are trained.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.820]   Many people don't know this, but they teach us in science not to ask questions, but to
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.600]   start with a question like how does the brain develop or something.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.040]   And then you say a hypothesis, and you test hypotheses, and then you figure out if they're
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   right or wrong.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.400]   And that takes you through a set of decision trees, and you eventually get at what you
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.280]   hope is some core truth, and then hopefully others arrive there as well, and you get a
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   consensus.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.680]   So I love the idea of hypothesis testing.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.280]   In fact, when you said take the most direct route from where we are now in Los Angeles
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.720]   to San Francisco, I like to take 101, not the 5.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.520]   The 5 is faster, so I immediately think-- but I like 101.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.480]   First of all, there are a couple of really great taco and hamburger spots along the way
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.680]   that I used to stop with my bulldog and get.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.600]   Also, you get to see the coast, and it makes those extra two hours completely worth it.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.120]   And so you're exactly right in that working through the decision tree doesn't necessarily
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.360]   mean presuming that the hypothesis is right.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   It sounds like you'd be equally OK with the hypothesis being wrong, because really what
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080]   you're trying to do is just learn.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.100]   And in learning, set up this collaboration.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.100]   I love that.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.600]   It's one of those cool things.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.880]   First of all, when you talk about hypothesis, when my son Brandon was involved in a company,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.120]   he's out on his own now, but he used to always say hypothesis, test your hypothesis.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.800]   He always used that term.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.520]   And then even now, if we were talking about it, and you just said you knew some hot dog
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.000]   and hamburger places, I'd be like, holy cow, I didn't even know that.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.480]   Yeah, I want to check those places out.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.960]   So that's how you discover new stuff in a conversation.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.720]   I love it.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.560]   And also, I'm sure people are noting to not say the words win-win when approaching any
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.380]   kind of negotiation.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.840]   What do you think it is about those little catchphrases that signal lack of authenticity
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.240]   or trustworthiness?
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.000]   Because you could imagine that somebody-- I come to you and say, hey, Chris, let's do
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.480]   some collaborative thing for social media, for podcast, and this is going to be a win-win
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   for both of us.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   Now I know to never say that with you.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.900]   But you could imagine that somebody really means that.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.880]   But for you, it sounds like it's a flag that they're trying to pull one over.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.680]   It correlates really strongly with the people that are definitely trying to cut your throat.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.360]   And I've had them admit that to me candidly.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.520]   I've experienced it.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   Like if somebody throws win-win out early to me, I'll say, all right, I think I know
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.960]   where this is going, but let me explore it.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.000]   And they'll say, yeah, this is a great opportunity for you.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.320]   It's another top.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.020]   And we're going to put you in a room with all these billionaires, and there's going
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.160]   to be all this opportunity for you if you just come in and speak.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.840]   And we don't have a budget.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.880]   Well, I've gotten that one before.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.200]   The famous the world will just work out in your favor because it's going to work out
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   in my favor.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   Right.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   Exactly right.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.560]   I've been on the receiving end of those offers many a time.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   Fascinating.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.200]   Conversely, what sorts of openers do you think establish the best rapport and benevolent
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.680]   discovery of a topic?
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.880]   Well, what I'm saying correlates real strongly with people I want to do business with.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.840]   If they figured out something that they know is valuable for me and they've just done it,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.760]   and they've just offered it, like right off the bat, no strings attached.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.520]   They found a way to drop something on me that's valuable.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   They didn't approach me with their hand out.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.960]   They approached me with some sort of generosity, like a friend of mine, Joe Polish, runs this
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.460]   outfit called Genius Network.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.000]   Joe says, "Life gives to the giver."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.960]   Joe did a bunch of favors for me before I ever joined.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   And he was trying to help me out and get my book sold, and he asked me to come in and
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:49.000]   speak and he'd emphasized my book on his podcast and in different conversations.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.600]   And I finally paid the fee to join, because he had done so much for me.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   There's not much Joe could ask me for right now, because he's done so much for me that
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.640]   he gets a blanket pretty much, "Yes, right away.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   What do you want?
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   What do you need?"
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400]   Because he's just generous.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.040]   And the generosity approach universally, I'm seeing a lot of really successful people that
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.360]   lead by generosity.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:20.400]   And so if you start out, if you give me a five-star review of the book on Amazon, no
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.260]   strings attached, or anything like that goes a long, long way to somebody who wants to
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.220]   establish a long-term relationship, collaboration.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:37.080]   When I first opened my laboratory in 2011, I had a technician at the time who had been
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.680]   a technician for a lot of years.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.000]   And there's this culture in science of people borrowing things from laboratories and not
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.800]   giving them back or breaking them.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.880]   These can be little things like a small instrument or a forceps.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.600]   But as a student or postdoc, these are the things that you covet, like a really nice
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   pair of forceps.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's like a great thing.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.840]   You drop them once, they're not good anymore, by the way.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.120]   You have to treat them with respect.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.760]   Surgical tools have to be treated with respect.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.740]   These are very fine instruments.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.060]   And people used to come by our lab all the time and borrow stuff from us.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.400]   And he'd always lend it out.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.360]   And I was like, "What are you doing?"
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.200]   But any time I went to go borrow something, he'd say, "Do not borrow anything from anybody
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.560]   else because then we're going to owe them."
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.040]   Right now, everybody owes us everything.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   And I was like, "You're running up our budget giving away these instruments.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.300]   They come back with the forceps, dented and stuff."
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.960]   And he said, "Just trust me.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.260]   This is the way to do it."
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.120]   And I don't recall ever "cashing in" on any of that, but he was exactly right.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.560]   When I eventually decided to move institutions, we'd given away so much and we had asked for
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.120]   so very little, maybe nothing, that when you leave a place, typically there can be a little
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.360]   bad blood.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.840]   And all we got was, "Sorry to see you go," kind of stuff.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.600]   Had it been me, I would have been in a kind of an exchange of, "Oh, we ask for things.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   We give things."
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   It's kind of a neighborhood.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.400]   I grew up in a neighborhood where you'd borrow eggs or milk from the neighbor.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Remember those days?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.560]   I don't know if people do that any longer.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.000]   But I think it falls well into what you're describing, that when you just do things for
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.500]   people out of goodness, then sure, you sort of have a history where you could return to
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   that they owe you.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.060]   But there's also just something good about just doing things out of goodness and also
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.020]   not asking for so much and expecting people to provide that.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.960]   So I love that.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.760]   And I actually-- I love providing good reviews for things I like.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.960]   On the phone, when the airline-- we don't do this anymore.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   We book our own flights.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.440]   But anytime I get help on the phone, and if it's really great help, I'll say, "How can
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   I help?"
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.840]   And they'll say, "Oh, it would mean a lot if you would send an email to my business
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.520]   just saying I did a great job," or something like that.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.780]   And I actually really enjoy doing that.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.380]   So I love the points you're making, because they're very actionable.
