[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.040]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.800]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.920]   I'm Tim Chen, and today's episode was made specifically
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.480]   for all the new grads entering the workforce.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.940]   What happens when expectation meets reality
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.920]   and is not what you thought it would be?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.640]   If I were to ask my college self upon graduation,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.800]   why I expect to achieve success,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.880]   I'll probably say one of the following.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.600]   Either I will outwork everyone
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.820]   because I struggled and I still graduated,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.120]   or I'm streetwise and paired with some natural talents
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.960]   I know I can figure things out.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.680]   I would have said, "That's cute,"
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   pat myself on the head and said, "Good luck with that.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.640]   "Let's talk again in 10 years."
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.340]   Because the reality of the situation was
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120]   my expectation of success, what it looks like,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.920]   and how quickly I believed I could achieve it
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.400]   was all way off.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.160]   And for high-performing graduates
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.800]   who enter the workforce with high distinction,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600]   the harsh reality of the job market
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   and the lack of glamor in that first entry-level job
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.020]   could in itself feel like a failure.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.360]   Let me tell you something right now.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.200]   It's not.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.260]   10 years later, you will tell yourself
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.640]   that experience is experience,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.880]   but being intentional about what you want to learn
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.260]   from each job you take is much more important.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.520]   So today, we're going to have a chat with Elizabeth Ingeley.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280]   She and I met when we were both at LinkedIn,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.100]   and she was a part
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.860]   of the prestigious Business Leadership Program.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.880]   We're going to talk about the highs and lows
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   of early career experience,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.800]   things we learned along the way,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.760]   and advice we would give to new college grads.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.960]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.480]   Hey, guys, you're listening to Let's Talk Jobs.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   I'm Tim Chen.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.360]   Joining us is Elizabeth Ingeley.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.000]   Elizabeth, how are you doing?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.840]   - I'm great.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.520]   Glad to be here.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   - Thanks, Elizabeth.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.160]   Today's episode is for anyone who is graduating college,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.560]   entering their first job,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.000]   or you're exiting your first job, going to your next one.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   And it's a topic about reality meeting expectations.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.640]   And so, Elizabeth,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.440]   can you tell us a little bit about your journey?
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   - Yeah.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.020]   Wow, that's such a big question, Tim.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.720]   (both laughing)
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   Okay.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   So, where I actually like to start my career journey
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.800]   is with my personal journey,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   because personal and work are really not,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.240]   really so interconnected.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   So, I actually grew up on a farm in Southern Illinois,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.680]   where there were two stoplights and 3,300 people.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.440]   So, even though I'm white and I don't look diverse,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.400]   I do consider my background to be very diverse
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800]   from many of the folks that I'm working with,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.600]   whose parents were probably in corporate jobs
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.640]   or somewhat similar jobs,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.120]   and maybe grew up in the suburbs or the city.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.400]   So, I'm really thankful for that background in a way,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   because I feel like it was very playful.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   And I also learned the values of humility and hard work.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.880]   So, when I went to the University of Illinois
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.520]   in Urbana-Champaign, which, by the way,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.600]   is one of the best schools in the world, Go Illini,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   that was 13 times the size of my hometown.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.560]   And after my freshman year,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.280]   I remember having a conversation with my mom
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.960]   and I was crying on her bed.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.160]   And she was like, "Well, do you just wanna come home
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.080]   "and go to the local community college?"
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.460]   And I said, "No, I know this is where I need to be,
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.920]   "but it's just really hard,"
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.080]   because I felt just like disconnected
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   and that was such a big leap out of my comfort zone.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   So, for anyone that's like in an environment
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.040]   where you're new and feeling like you're not enough
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   or your background isn't enough,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.760]   I would encourage you to stick it out
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.800]   for as long as you can,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.840]   unless you're still feeling that tension after some time.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.040]   But fast forward, had a great sophomore year,
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.320]   freshman year was a little bit rough.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.440]   And then I started a national nonprofit
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   that educates girls in STEM called MakerGirl
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.280]   out of a social entrepreneurship class
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600]   that I took for fun my senior year.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.120]   And I know we're gonna talk about that later,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   but then I started my career in sales at LinkedIn
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.680]   in the business leadership program, which is how we met.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.760]   And I'm so thankful God brought us together.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.120]   And that was never a job
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.200]   that I would have seen myself doing.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.000]   Oftentimes at that point, when I told people I did sales,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   they were really, really surprised
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.920]   because I was like the introverted quiet girl
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.440]   on the side of the room.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200]   And I still am much more introverted
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.400]   and more of like a curious observer.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   But I ended up loving that job in some ways
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.720]   because I mean, there's just so much I could say
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.400]   about working at LinkedIn that we don't have the time for,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.720]   but it was such an amazing place
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.160]   to start my first job out of college
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.920]   because there were so many people there
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.000]   that could be their full selves at work.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.640]   And in sales, I learned the art and science
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.240]   of asking meaningful yet difficult questions,
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.720]   which I still use and consider
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   one of my greatest superpowers to this day.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.880]   And then I had always known
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.360]   that I wanted to go back to school.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   So I applied to get my MBA from like all of the top schools,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.160]   like Harvard, Stanford, Kellogg, and I didn't get accepted.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   And even I remember thinking that like I had to get accepted
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.360]   because I had hired a coach
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   and the coach said like my essays were really great,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.480]   but I ended up not getting accepted,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   but there was something better on the corner
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.640]   and that was getting my master's in human-centered design
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.560]   at the Institute of Design in Chicago,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   which is where I was living at the time.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.800]   And that was a much better fit for me.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.640]   And then I worked at Deloitte and consulting
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.880]   for about 15 months.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   And now I'm at Walgreens as a service designer.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.320]   So I think a lot of the themes of my story
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.720]   is that my career path is very unexpected.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.080]   And like there are twists and turns all over
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.680]   and I'm pretty early on in my career,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   but every time I feel like in some ways like I failed
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   or I didn't get what I wanted,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.760]   there was something around the corner
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.920]   that was a much better fit for me.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   So for anyone that may be struggling
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   or may be surprised by where your career
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.680]   and your journey is taking you,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.880]   know that it can all be meant for good
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.240]   and that you can find a lot of surprises in the journey.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   So I'm seeing you smiling, Tim,
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.160]   and I'm wondering if that resonates with you.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.200]   - It absolutely does.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.880]   My academic career was absolutely winding.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.120]   And I think it's one of those things where in college,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.200]   and actually in high school,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.040]   I was one of those super achieving people, right?
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   Like the group of friends I hang out with,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.680]   we were known for being both well-rounded in education
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.480]   as well as being highly active in extracurriculars.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.240]   And so there was a lot of expectation
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.880]   put on our groups in general, right?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.960]   And from parents as well.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   And then you continue on to college
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.080]   and a lot of my friends went on to really big schools, right?
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.760]   And then for me, you know,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.680]   I came into it thinking I was gonna be a doctor.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.040]   I love how the mind works.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.600]   Psychiatry is where I wanted to go.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   And so again, I came in with this expectation
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.720]   that I'm gonna do pre-med
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.960]   and everyone expected that as me as well, right?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.680]   And the reality is I am terrible at biology.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.160]   I could not remember everything.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.200]   I didn't realize how much memorization went into that,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.800]   right?
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.600]   And after two years, my grades just were just terrible.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   I was like, "Hey, I need to do a pivot."
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.240]   I feel like I've lost two years.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.520]   School is really expensive.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.960]   I was at Whitman College.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.400]   And so I decided to go back to my local state university
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.920]   'cause it's cheaper.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.440]   And then like, you think of all the stereotypes
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.120]   that an Asian person can go through.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.280]   I was like, "Well, I'm not gonna do medicine.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.240]   I guess it's engineering."
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.800]   Like that was literally the thought process.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   So I gave that a try.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.200]   And I was like even more somehow terrible at engineering
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   than pre-med.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.920]   And I went through that.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.800]   And the only thing that kept my grade afloat
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.560]   was business school or business classes for undergrad.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   And so I kind of worked my way through that.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.320]   And I kind of aged myself.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   I graduated in 2001
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.520]   and that's the era of the dot-com bubble burst, right?
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.800]   And so no one was getting hired in marketing.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.280]   And my introduction into the workforce
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.440]   was having a degree in marketing
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.120]   that no one was hiring for.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.880]   In a time where the market for jobs was really, really soft.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.360]   And so it was very not glamorous.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.160]   And as a matter of fact, I had to deal with two degrees.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.280]   Some of the shame of going to a state school, right?
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.400]   There's nothing wrong with state schools.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.920]   It's just for my parents and friends,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.040]   it's not what people had envisioned of me.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.000]   And also the same that like us,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.360]   I took all these part-time jobs.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.560]   So I'm kind of curious for you,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.880]   like maybe we're gonna start with LinkedIn
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.400]   because LinkedIn is, and companies like LinkedIn,
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.440]   it's actually very unique in that
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.000]   it values things like compassion, empathy
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   and all that kind of good stuff,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.120]   has a lot of employee resources and a lot of benefits, right?
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   But then when you leave that,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.720]   so when that safety net is pulled away,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.520]   that's really what the world is like.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.640]   And so you came in, you mentioned BLP program,
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.160]   just for everyone listening to this,
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   that's a very prestigious program.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.240]   And so it's a very select few.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.160]   Everyone who comes out of the program
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   usually continues on to be very, very successful.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.280]   And so you kind of start your career
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.240]   at a company like LinkedIn
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.040]   with a lot of accolades and success.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.840]   So can you tell us a little bit about that experience
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.960]   and maybe where you went from there
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.080]   and maybe like some of the roams,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   the roses and thorns of starting at a company like LinkedIn?
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   - Yeah, well, first of all,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.080]   I wanna say that I really resonate with your comment
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   about coming from a state school
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   and feeling like you're not sure if you really fit in
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   because I was so proud to go to U of I in Champaign
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.320]   being one of the first people in my family
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.360]   to go to a four-year university right after high school.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.520]   And then when I got to LinkedIn in San Francisco,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.800]   I felt totally like a fish out of water
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   in that there are cohorts of students fresh out of school.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.840]   And out of my 30-person cohort,
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.920]   seven of them went to Harvard.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   And I just remember feeling like, again,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.040]   like what am I doing here?
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.680]   What is in this for me?
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.120]   And I, again, I'm so glad I stuck it out
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.160]   and I'm still very proud of my Illini background
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.120]   for the record.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.200]   But LinkedIn, I mean, such an amazing place to work.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.120]   I think what attracted me to the organization
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.120]   was just the sense of going through interviews
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.960]   and feeling like the person that I was getting
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.600]   in the interview was the same person that would go home
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.120]   and take care of their kids at night.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.360]   And in the other places,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.080]   I just felt like there was this work persona
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.120]   and then maybe a personal persona.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.720]   And even though I hadn't worked in that many places,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.240]   that was something that was felt.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.200]   And so for anyone that is early on in your job search,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.080]   I would say definitely listen to your gut
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.880]   and listen to your intuition about a place.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.520]   And I know a lot of interviews are virtual,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.400]   but I would really try to go into the office
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.520]   and have coffee with the team that you'll be working for.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.160]   'Cause there's just so much data that you can gather
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.920]   from actually being there, being with that person,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.120]   observing how other people are working.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.680]   So that's why I chose to join LinkedIn,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.920]   one of the many reasons.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   But I also just felt like I could always be safe
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.680]   with my managers, they were amazing.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.340]   And we talked about like personal stuff and work stuff,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.960]   which I think is important if you're fresh out of school
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.320]   and you're still like figuring out yourself as an adult,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.640]   that year of being 22 or 23 and graduating college
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.240]   and being all out on your own is such a stressful,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.920]   transformative year for a lot of people.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   And I would say too that I just felt like I could bring
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.160]   all of my gifts to the workplace there.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.920]   And what that means is even though I was in sales
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.120]   and I didn't feel like the typical sales person,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.560]   I got to start the non-profit team
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.060]   at the non-profit account executive team
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   under David Ellis and Ariana Unay and Sam Patel.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:11.280]   And they really helped me bring my experience
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.920]   and bring my non-profit experience into that team.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.560]   And they recognize that I had all of this knowledge
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.800]   from building my own non-profit that I could bring there
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.000]   and they asked for it.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.440]   And so they allowed me to bring all parts of myself
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.000]   into that job.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.280]   And I felt like if I ever had an idea for a workshop
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.120]   that I wanted to lead for my team, I could do that.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.240]   So I was almost like thinking
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.800]   like an entrepreneur at LinkedIn.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.000]   So that is really important.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.840]   And for anyone that might be struggling
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.400]   or has an idea that would make you happier at work,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.340]   I would say the onus is on you to bring that to the team.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.040]   It sounds really silly,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   but like when I was managing a Deloitte project,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.800]   I felt like one of the rituals that I brought
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.360]   was like asking a fun question
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.960]   at the beginning of every team meeting.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.860]   It allows you to just connect with your coworkers
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.080]   on such a deeper level.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.040]   So I would recommend for anything
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.520]   that you're not getting in your environment,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.600]   just ask yourself like how you can make it
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.960]   a little bit better and who you might be able to go to.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.280]   And I know that not all companies are like that
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   where you have that ownership,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.080]   but we do have a lot in our power to change.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   And so I think the flip side of that is that
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.320]   in a lot of organizations,
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   unfortunately there isn't as much psychological safety
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.880]   and fun and free lunch.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.280]   It felt like every other week at LinkedIn on a Friday,
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.560]   there was like, oh, there's this flower arranging workshop
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.200]   or there's this company downstairs
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.480]   that is giving out free hats.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.480]   And that is like 1% of workplace culture in companies.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   And that was like really fun and I'm so grateful for that.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:15.160]   But what I would recommend if you're starting a new job
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   that is not like LinkedIn
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.240]   or maybe not like a typical tech company culture
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   is to find those buddies really quickly in your first week
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.960]   or first or second week of onboarding
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.760]   that you can just be super real with
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.520]   about like what's really expected of me
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   when it comes to my job itself,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.480]   when it comes to meeting people and having coffee chats.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.600]   Because there are so many unwritten rules
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.560]   in an organization and working virtually
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.160]   makes that even harder to figure out those unwritten rules.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   So I would set up coffee chats to meet people,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.080]   feel safe and also ask those questions
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.840]   about like what's expected of me
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.920]   that's not on my job description.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.080]   How do I meet people and make connections in a real way
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.880]   like versus like, and also just having a lot of leadership
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.480]   in your corner is important.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:22.280]   One of my friends who had left consulting from grad school
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.720]   suggested that I meet with people
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   who have since left that organization that I was joining.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.320]   And I wish I would have done that
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.920]   because I think people who have left that organization
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.080]   have already processed it
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.280]   and they're in a new environment where they can say
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.920]   this is what's real about this place
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.000]   and give you the full answer.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.920]   And there's no stakes in it for them anymore
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.600]   and they're not drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   So that's a lot of my advice for starting a new job
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.120]   and also maybe transitioning to a culture
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   that feels a little uneasy at times.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.840]   - Yeah, and I wanted to add to that as well
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.320]   'cause I think for your first job,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.400]   especially if you come out with a really,
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.600]   like let's say really powerful degree
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   that you're really proud of
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.960]   and it's kind of your bread and butter,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.640]   oftentimes that first job may not necessarily be aligned
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   to your education.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.000]   As a matter of fact, I would say
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.360]   everything I learned with marketing,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.680]   I probably didn't use until like
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.400]   maybe six years into my career.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.240]   The first season of my career
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.600]   was just trying to figure stuff out and discover who I am.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.720]   And so I think for everyone coming out of college,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.080]   I think you should expect that.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.000]   Unless your education is directly related to your work,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.680]   like let's say if you're an academia-focused job
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.520]   or doing medicine,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.320]   obviously that's kind of directly one-on-one.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.040]   But for high-tech in particular,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   just know that it's not just the courses
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   or your major you learned in school,
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.200]   it's how you talk to your students, your peers,
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.480]   how you talk to your teacher
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.240]   'cause the communication part of it,
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.800]   you'll be using that one first.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.040]   And I kind of wish I knew this early in my career,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   which is going to every job with a strong point of view
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.200]   on what you want to get out of the job.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.160]   'Cause it's like, when I came out of college,
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.320]   the market was really soft.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.080]   So I took a whole bunch of really random jobs
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.680]   as a part of unemployment or whatever it is.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.600]   And one of them was like content entry, right?
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   And I was actually working for a house that we,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   basically I made sausages, right?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.680]   And I was also IT.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.320]   So it's all none of it's related,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.240]   but from each of those in hindsight, I picked up something,
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   whether it's how I deal with rejection.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.920]   Like I was on a call center for like Wells Fargo
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.440]   getting rejected every Monday morning
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   'cause no one wanted to talk to me
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.800]   'cause they didn't want to learn
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   that they overdrew their checking account
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.200]   and now they owe the big money.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.720]   So like everything has a purpose.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.760]   And so if you go into a job with that expectation
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.560]   of learning something, then no job is ever beneath you.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.040]   And the reason that's important is,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.600]   especially for early career people,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.000]   like especially with the ones that I've managed,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.840]   the trait that I look for is either a kind of go-getter,
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.040]   entrepreneurial mindset where they're just,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.320]   they're gonna do whatever it takes to figure it out.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.040]   And the other one is looking at how they process things.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.840]   So it's less about the end goal,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.720]   it's more around like their thinking process,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.360]   how they arrive at a conclusion.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.440]   And so I like your feedback around,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.960]   your suggestion around talking to people
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.600]   or finding leaders or people who've left
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.360]   and now they have a different point of view.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.080]   'Cause that could maybe give you some insight
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.720]   on how maybe you should approach things differently
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   within that company,
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.680]   which might be unique to their culture.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.360]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.200]   - And I'm kind of curious, Elizabeth,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.840]   LinkedIn is a fantastic place to work.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.680]   I absolutely agree.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.040]   As a matter of fact, a lot of my greatest friends
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.680]   were there, you included.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.080]   And I think a lot of the really powerful life lessons
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.720]   I learned was only through LinkedIn.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.440]   But you're right, it's like a 1% thing
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.880]   where not every company is that healthy
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.520]   or encouraging or supportive of employees
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.600]   with all these resources, right?
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.440]   When you leave the safety net of a place
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.360]   like LinkedIn and you go on to your next adventure,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.800]   and you mentioned there's MakerGurl,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.560]   there's other things that you're doing as well.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.840]   Like what was the reality that met you once you left that?
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.800]   Did you learn anything about yourself
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.160]   that maybe you took for granted,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.760]   that was there for you at LinkedIn
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.080]   and now you kind of need to lean on yourself
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.480]   a little more in other ways?
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.360]   - Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.600]   So what I did right after LinkedIn
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.800]   was actually going into grad school
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.240]   and the human-centered design program
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   at the Institute of Design feels very nurturing as well.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.840]   So it almost was in some sense a continuation of LinkedIn,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.960]   which also is a very nurturing environment to work.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.200]   In terms of what I did next,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.520]   so I worked in consulting,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.800]   which is definitely a very different environment.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   And I think that what I wish I would have done
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:27.120]   was done more reflecting on what it is about LinkedIn
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.160]   that made me feel so safe and seen
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.280]   and how can I get this in that next environment.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.960]   So it's almost like doing a whole design thinking exercise
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.000]   on your own life and also just realizing
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.440]   that every job is temporary.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.040]   And there are some things
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   that I really liked about consulting,
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.960]   some things that I really didn't like.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   And so I would say really just pull out those things
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.520]   that you really like and continue to ask yourself
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.720]   how you can get that in your next environment.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.440]   So for me, like in this job,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.400]   I wanted an environment where I felt supported
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   and safe to bring up my own ideas
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.160]   because that is very important to me
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.120]   to feel like a sense of ownership over my work.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.760]   And I'm also in a process right now
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.600]   of creating my own personal definition of success.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   And I think that from our previous conversations,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.120]   you're probably in that too,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.000]   as you are thinking a lot about mentorship
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.680]   versus like moving up the ladder.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   So for me, right now I'm in a place
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.880]   where my personal definition of success
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.440]   or one of them at work is,
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.960]   how well do I really know my coworkers?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.840]   And how well can I speak into them
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.560]   and help them with whatever it is they're going through,
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   whether it's at work or at home.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.040]   And then as far as the work itself,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.640]   I think like how well does this work live on beyond me?
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.400]   So I think just being really true
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.680]   and understanding your own definitions
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.000]   based on where you're at in your career
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.600]   and what it is that you really value versus other people.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.960]   And I know that that is a constant
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.160]   iterative changing definition
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.280]   based on where we're all at in our journeys.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.400]   And social media and other platforms
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.080]   make it so easy to compare,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.000]   but it is really important to be like very pigeonholed
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.080]   and say, this is the lane that I'm in right now
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.440]   and almost like envision a tunnel
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.560]   and be like, how can I do my best in this lane?
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.000]   So that's something I've been thinking a lot about lately.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.560]   - Yeah, that's a very actually mature outlook on stuff
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.320]   'cause at your point in career and mine, I wasn't there.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.880]   I was measuring my success by income or by title,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.320]   which wasn't there for me,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.080]   or friendships that I've built and whatnot.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.040]   And all those things over time kept changing, right?
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.160]   So if I decided to find success in a way
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.480]   that depends on people and they're gone,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.160]   then I kind of had to start from square one again.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   And I think understanding your true values
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.640]   is kind of where I started maybe shifting my own lens
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.840]   on how I even look at success or whatnot.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.840]   'Cause I started realizing I work really, really hard, right?
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   And that's gonna get rewarded
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.800]   in however the company wants to reward it.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.080]   And sometimes it makes me happy
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.920]   and sometimes I can still work hard
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.240]   and the outcome is not desirable
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.200]   and I don't understand why.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.560]   And then I start blaming myself or whatnot.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.800]   And I started realizing that I'm putting a lot of my control
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.640]   over happiness and success in someone else's hands, right?
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.400]   Their evaluation of my performance
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.360]   is now driving my sense of value.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.480]   And so my big shift was,
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   and you and I actually do this as well
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.160]   during our one-on-one sessions or when we just chat,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.720]   is just kind of coming back to discovering your true self.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   Like what is it that truly gives you joy?
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.560]   And what is it that you truly value?
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.400]   And sometimes you don't know,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.960]   but the goal is to just discover who the real you is, right?
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.040]   And when you kind of come to terms with that,
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.280]   then when you look at the work environment,
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.400]   you can start to maybe digest or unpack
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.200]   why a certain situation caused you
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.640]   to have an adverse reaction.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.280]   'Cause maybe it actually directly conflicted
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.320]   with a personal value that you weren't thinking about
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.360]   and that inside a fundamental level, it bothered you.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   And for me, I'm on the other end of the career than you.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.640]   I got several years on you in terms of age.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.240]   And I'm realizing now that at this point in my career,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.560]   so like it was at 25 years in,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.280]   it's now a lot less about titles
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.080]   'cause quite frankly, I don't care about that anymore.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.280]   And income, I don't care about that.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.520]   Not that I don't need money.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   Everyone needs the income, but it doesn't define success.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.280]   Kind of like you, it's landing on people.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.040]   And what kind of impact do I want to leave my legacy
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.800]   or whatnot, and I've got kids as well.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.040]   So I'm trying to set a good example for them.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   Yeah, I think that's my kind of where I'm at right now too.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.600]   - Yeah.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.480]   Well, I am curious about that.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   So what, I guess like, how did you get to that place
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.280]   when I'm sure you're at a point in your career
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.560]   where people are buying second houses
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.880]   and have luxury cars and are like thinking
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.240]   about their children's education
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   and spending as much on preschool as we did on college.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.760]   - Yeah.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.320]   - How do you continue to stay true to that
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.680]   when I guess like the game of comparison
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   only gets bigger and bigger and yeah.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.080]   - Well, the game of comparison bundled
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.800]   with things like imposter syndrome
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.520]   are almost always there, right?
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.200]   I think the pivot point for me was,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.840]   so in my career, I've actually early on,
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.600]   I've had a lot of really terrible managers,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.880]   ones that really made me question my existence
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.040]   and values of human being.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   Like it's really, there's a few that really broke me down
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.880]   to my core.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.640]   And there was one instance at Logitech specifically
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.960]   where I had it.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.120]   I was like, I know I'm more than this.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.320]   I'm more than the work.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   And I was thinking about at the end of the day,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.520]   I'm clearly disposable for in a company's eyes, right?
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.560]   We're a number and we're there to solve a problem
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.520]   that the company needs to move forward.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.080]   But at the end of my life,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.640]   when I think of like, doesn't be really, really dark,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.120]   but let's say the tombstone
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.080]   and people are gathering around and remembering who I was,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.480]   no one's gonna remember me for how many projects I launched
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   or no one's gonna remember me
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.800]   for how much revenue I generated for a company.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.560]   They're gonna remember me for how I related to them, right?
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.520]   Or my impact on them.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.600]   And so that's when I started realizing,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.080]   I was like, you know what?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.720]   One of my core values I wanna be remembered for
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.560]   is like, you know what?
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.240]   Tim like just didn't give up.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.320]   Like he just pushed through.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.000]   And so that's, at that point in my life,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.360]   it changed my mindset of working for myself
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.600]   versus working for the company.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.960]   And a lot of times they align
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.520]   'cause obviously the harder I worked,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.360]   the company benefited from it,
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.000]   but I'm working for myself now.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840]   - Yeah.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.080]   - At this point in my career,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.200]   then if you kind of evolve that thinking,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.160]   like I'm thankful that I have an awesome wife
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.520]   who has a very stable job.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.040]   Quite frankly, I don't know how people do
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.080]   single income in California.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.720]   It happens and I just don't get it.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   And so thankfully there's some stability there,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.800]   especially when I was unemployed,
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.920]   we started feeling that, right?
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.080]   But some of that is just the math of knowing,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   hey, look, if we, our total cost is X, Y, and Z,
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.040]   and we know how much income we need to bring in,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.120]   like, so you need to figure out the math.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.200]   Now, the things that affect the equation,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.240]   like we have kids is like, okay,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.280]   well, we will just eat out less.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.920]   We're gonna buy one bulk thing at Costco
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.800]   and that's gonna last us for the week or whatever it is.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   So there's ways of adjusting your cost of living
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.280]   to make it work, which allows me to then,
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.440]   again, go back to detaching myself
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.880]   from the stress of finance.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.960]   If I was a single income earner though,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.800]   which thankfully I have not experienced
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.640]   the same situation where I'm unemployed,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.560]   I think my answer to you might be really, really different.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.960]   I would, it'd be coming from a point of desperation,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.160]   probably, because you've got to pay your bills and whatnot.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.080]   And how that would have been different
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.920]   during this period of unemployment, for example,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   like I gave myself like a month
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.120]   to just kind of figure myself out
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.640]   before I went back into it.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.320]   And then almost, not to necessarily take the luxury,
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.240]   but giving myself a little grace period.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.440]   Again, we did the math of how long
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.520]   I could be unemployed for.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.520]   And so allowed myself to try to find the best job.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.960]   But if I were a single income earner and lost my job,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.720]   I'd get the very first thing available to me,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.080]   maybe take multiple jobs, right?
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.240]   But I think in the end, like I said before,
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.560]   knowing when I'm gonna get out of that experience,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.520]   'cause I'm gonna use that experience in my next interview
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.400]   for the dream job and say,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.920]   "Hey, look, here's, I worked through that."
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.080]   Yeah, that's kind of how I do it right now.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.160]   - I'm also curious if you talked to your kids
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   about what was happening during that time too.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.840]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.840]   You know, it's funny.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.600]   It took me a while to first come to terms with it
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.480]   on my own, quite frankly, about unemployment.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.600]   What I'm afraid of with my girls,
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.680]   'cause they're eight and 10,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.040]   and they jibba jabba with their friends.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.920]   And they're friends' parents, I know them,
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   and they're all super successful Bay Area people, right?
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.280]   And so I wanted to control the narrative
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.640]   that came out of their mouths a little bit.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.040]   But the narrative would be around,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.440]   not only that daddy lost his job, but just the fear.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.600]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, where the food is gonna come from?"
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.760]   All this kind of paranoia.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.160]   I wasn't ready to deal with the conversation yet.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.200]   So I kept the unemployment part to myself
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.080]   for the greater part of a month.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   So they just assumed I went to work
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.120]   after dropping them off at school.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.560]   So I would dress up decently as if I'm going to work.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.520]   I'll drop them off at school, I'll come back home,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.160]   dress down back into sweats.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   And that was like my reality for a few months.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.120]   Well, also try and launch this podcast.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.040]   But when I was ready, I sat down and I talked to them.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.640]   And as a matter of fact,
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.280]   so you and I, we're both people of faith.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   And so I was going through like at night,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.080]   we go through our devotions together
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.360]   and kind of walking through some stuff
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.600]   and some stories of the Bible.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.840]   And one of them was like story of Job.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.360]   Like Job was a guy who was known
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.480]   for being really dedicated to God,
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.000]   but then God allowed him to be tested, right?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.480]   And so like all these crazy things happened to him,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.960]   but at the end of the day, like he still prevailed.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.600]   When I shared that story
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.720]   and then kind of talked to the girls
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.520]   about how like prayers get answered or whatnot,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.160]   that's the opportunity I used to be transparent to them.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.400]   I was like, "Hey, by the way,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.600]   "like this story is not just a story.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.560]   "Like your daddy's kind of going through that too.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.960]   "Like I'm dealing with some stuff
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.720]   "for the past month I didn't tell you about."
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.880]   And I allowed myself to be a little vulnerable.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.640]   I chose vocabulary that was appropriate
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.560]   for an eight and 10 year old,
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.200]   but I used a lot of illustrations
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.080]   to kind of illustrate how I'm processing things,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.360]   trying to help them realize that daddy's not scared,
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.000]   so you shouldn't be scared.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.640]   And then more importantly,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.440]   it was about helping them understand
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.480]   how I'm working through that,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.000]   'cause there's skills that they can use now,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.920]   like resilience and being creative, right?
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.560]   Being resourceful and praying
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.120]   and relying on working with people
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.680]   to kind of help support you.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.960]   So I did bring them into that journey
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.160]   'cause I think there's a lot of things that they learn.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.760]   And so thankfully, I don't think they walked away
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   that with a negative perception on the situation.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.880]   They seemed like they really
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.280]   kind of took those lessons to heart.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.840]   And that's kind of the stress of a parent,
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.680]   especially a dad where I just assume
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.360]   that eventually they'll project,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.120]   whether the future partner happens to be a guy,
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.760]   I would assume that they would look for values
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.000]   similar to what their daddy had.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.760]   And so I kind of have to figure out
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.360]   how to be this larger version of myself
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.520]   in work and in personal.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.720]   - Wow, there's so much there,
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   but yeah, I want to acknowledge you.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.840]   And I think that's something
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.760]   that I've always really appreciated
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.040]   about our conversations
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.800]   is that you're just so intentional
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.400]   for how you frame things to the audience
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.440]   that you're speaking to,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.040]   whether it's me and taking yourself back
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.360]   to where you were at the point in my shoes
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.000]   or your daughter's.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.920]   And I'm sure you continue to do the same
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.600]   for other different folks in your life.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.920]   But yeah, that's amazing that you're just thinking
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.440]   about the perception of not wanting them to be afraid
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.040]   because that sticks with you.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.160]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.440]   I think, actually, you exhibit some things
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.040]   that I use you as an example with my kids
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.320]   with some things we talked about.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.560]   I didn't tell you about this.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.360]   I didn't prepare you for this.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.920]   You are awesome at asking questions.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.280]   There's a degree of self-awareness that you have,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   which is really, really cool,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.400]   even though you don't know all the answers.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.560]   And what I mean is this.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.400]   So early on after LinkedIn, you reached out
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.160]   and we decided, "Hey, let's do a monthly,
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.680]   "bi-monthly kind of just sync up and see how we're doing."
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.400]   And you're always good about asking questions.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.120]   And I'm kind of curious, where does that come from?
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.840]   How do you know at a given point in time,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.520]   given what you're dealing with,
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   how much you're willing to share,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.120]   how much you were not willing to share
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.160]   with someone like me?
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.280]   Can you talk about your self-awareness piece?
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.440]   How do you determine how you're gonna bring someone in
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.560]   and utilize questions to get the most out of a mentor
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.600]   or someone like me?
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.000]   - Thank you.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.400]   Honestly, I do feel like that is my superpower.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.720]   And I don't know where it comes from.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.920]   I think we each have superpowers
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.680]   that are somewhat nature and nurture.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   Maybe that is from just feeling that sense
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   of being different, given my background is very different
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.640]   than, like I said, other people's,
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   and I'm sure everyone has a different background
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.040]   in some capacity, or yeah, they do.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   And I think it is just from growing up in a place where,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.760]   growing up in a place that felt small,
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   I was always curious about, okay,
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   like what is on the outside of like this little,
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.880]   this town that I'm in, or what, going to college,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.560]   like, okay, there are all these kids
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.760]   from the Chicago suburbs.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.560]   What is their experience like right now
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.960]   that's so different than mine?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.120]   And why am I not feeling the freshman year,
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.320]   like excitement that they're feeling?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.960]   And then similarly, like then going to San Francisco,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.600]   like another big pool where I'm like, oh, wow,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.800]   how do people live here?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   And what are they thinking about in their career?
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.360]   And how can I just continue to like learn from them?
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   So I do think that that is somewhat just innate to me.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.440]   And it's why I transitioned to being a design researcher
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.560]   and service designer,
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.600]   because that's what you get to do for a living.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.320]   But over time, it's just,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.160]   you asked about the relational piece of it.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   And I think it's like,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   I really try to show up to conversations very prepared
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.240]   with the sense of what it is that I want to get out of it.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.680]   And I think that like that five to 10 minutes of preparation
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.280]   goes a really long way.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.400]   Just like looking at someone's LinkedIn profile,
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.320]   being like, oh, that's interesting.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.120]   Like, why did they choose to go to that university?
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.120]   Or what they wrote about this job is really unique.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.480]   And like you working at a call center,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.360]   I didn't know that before.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.080]   But like now I'm curious, like as a service designer,
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.560]   we talk about the call center all the time
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.320]   and how that solves problems.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.720]   So I'm like, oh, that's really cool.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.320]   So I think, yeah, that is one of my strengths
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.720]   is just going through life with a sense of curiosity.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.560]   - Yeah, and I think taking the time to pause and reflect
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.600]   what you clearly do is important.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.480]   I didn't do any of that earlier in my career.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.960]   And I actually went through probably the first 10,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.600]   15 years of my career without a mentor
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.360]   to remind myself how that's important.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.000]   So I'm really excited to see you
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.080]   already having that self-awareness and doing that
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.840]   and having a core to who you are.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.320]   And it's really smart what you said about taking the time
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.560]   to prepare for conversation,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   getting to know what's in someone else's either headspace
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.560]   or getting to know more about them
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.520]   before you engage within conversation.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.880]   That skillset will carry you out
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.200]   through all levels of organization,
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.720]   depending on where you go in your career.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.680]   So that's really cool.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.520]   - Thank you.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.680]   - Elizabeth, I just want to thank you
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.200]   for today's conversation.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.120]   I think it was just a great reminder
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.600]   for people coming out of college.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.520]   Look, you can take full control of your first job.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.160]   I think having self-awareness,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.120]   being able to ignite your passion,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.520]   kind of discover who you are
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.760]   and just trying to figure that out
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.960]   and working relationally with people,
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.040]   that's all really, really important.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.840]   So I'm thanking you for your time
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.520]   and hopefully we can have you on here again soon.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.360]   - Definitely.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.160]   And can I leave the audience with a little,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.120]   just like last few tidbits?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.640]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.800]   - Yeah.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.480]   So we didn't get to talk about Make a Girl,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.440]   but for anyone in their 20s,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.760]   I would recommend starting something,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.720]   whether it's like passion project
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.240]   where you just get people together like once a month
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.480]   or making a piece of art
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.880]   and showing it at the gallery down the street.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Definitely like put your work out there
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.160]   and put your ideas out there
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.960]   because that gives you a sense of ownership
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.360]   and an entrepreneurial,
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.960]   you'd think I would know how to say that word by now,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.080]   mindset that you can bring to other places
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.760]   and people love new ideas
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.400]   and new ways of thinking about things.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.960]   So like that is super valuable.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.600]   And I would also say just like
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.560]   sit in a posture of expectancy.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.760]   If you're not where you wanna be,
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.080]   there is some level of ownership
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.520]   that you can take over that.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.800]   But also there's some sense of,
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.080]   like if you're just doing good work
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.760]   and putting your best into it and continuing to learn,
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.480]   like you're doing great.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.200]   But just sit in a posture of expectancy of like,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.840]   oh, like maybe I'm not exactly where I wanna be,
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   but I do feel like this is going to lead me somewhere great
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.520]   and like something is around the corner.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   So I think that I wish I would have done that earlier on
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.560]   and I'm still like talking to myself
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.640]   about easing up on like the wheel of control,
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.760]   but just having that posture of expectancy
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.560]   and in the minor things, like what's gonna happen today
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.800]   and also in the major things of like,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   what's my next job gonna be
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.760]   is a really powerful place to sit.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.360]   - I'm gonna do an edit on this part.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.160]   I'm gonna quickly record an introduction to that
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.000]   'cause that's awesome.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.880]   So I'm gonna remove that outro for a second.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.960]   - What, what?
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.000]   - Oh, earlier I ended the podcast
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.520]   and you let in Maker Girl again.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.200]   I'm gonna record something right now to,
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.040]   I'm gonna edit that out.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.280]   I'm gonna put this in.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.600]   - But I can't say-
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.480]   - No, no, no, I'll do it for you.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.320]   I'll do it for you.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.040]   - Okay, cool.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.840]   - All right.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.400]   So Elizabeth, one thing you had mentioned earlier
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.160]   in our conversation is Maker Girl
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.080]   and that totally fascinates me
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.360]   for being someone so young in your position,
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.200]   starting something.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.600]   So can you tell us a little bit about
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.920]   what you learned from creating your own business
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.040]   at such a young age?
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.560]   Nice, I'm gonna edit that into that thing.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.280]   Cool, yeah, but I just wanna thank you again so much,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.840]   seriously, for joining the call.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.760]   I think, yeah, your insights are really, really valuable
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.680]   and I think there's a lot that people can learn
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.520]   from what you said.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.360]   There's a lot of wisdom there.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.640]   So thanks again.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.360]   - Yeah, I wanted to thank you
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.960]   for just being there all the time.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   And like, I think from our lunches at LinkedIn
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.440]   in San Francisco to our continued conversations
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.720]   where I can just be real and vulnerable with you
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.200]   about the things that I'm feeling,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.240]   it really, really goes such a long way.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.640]   So really appreciate you.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.120]   - All right, thanks, Lizeth.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.600]   Talk to you soon.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.440]   - Bye.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.020]   (gentle music)
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.080]   you
