[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.300]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.500]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.880]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.040]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.160]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.440]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.520]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.920]   Inside Tracker analyzes your blood and DNA
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880]   to give you an accurate assessment
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.900]   of your health and your biological age.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.520]   There are many things about our health
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720]   that can only be analyzed from blood and DNA tests.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.360]   I've been getting my blood assessed for many years now,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.460]   and about a year ago, I switched to Inside Tracker.
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.080]   What I like about Inside Tracker
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.360]   is that you get all this information back
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920]   about metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720]   that are really important to your health.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.380]   But unlike a lot of blood tests
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.660]   where you just get all the numbers back
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.560]   and it tells you whether or not things are high,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.120]   normal, or low, Inside Tracker also has this really useful
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.500]   and really easy-to-use dashboard
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.560]   that takes the information for your blood and DNA tests
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.320]   and points you toward particular behavioral,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   nutritional, and other sorts of protocols
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.160]   that you can use to get the numbers
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.680]   where you want them for your health.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.760]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.000]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.320]   and they will give you 25% off any of their programs.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560]   Again, their programs allow you to assess your health
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   from the inside, things that you could just never assess
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.040]   from any kind of test that didn't involve blood and DNA.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.520]   And it also has this really interesting feature
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.080]   that it can measure your inner age,
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.700]   which is based on biology.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.280]   Your chronological age, of course,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.140]   is very informative about your health
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740]   and where you ought to be in terms of health metrics,
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.860]   but people vary.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.840]   We know people, of course,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.540]   that are in their late 90s who are doing well.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.960]   We know people that are in their 50s who are struggling
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.160]   or even in their 20s.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800]   So blood and DNA are the way to analyze your health.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   That's my belief.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.380]   That's why I use Inside Tracker.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.200]   So go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.060]   to get 25% off any of their products
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.700]   and use Huberman at checkout.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.960]   Our second sponsor of today's episode is Helix Sleep.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.460]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.920]   that are ideally suited to your needs
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.520]   for the best night's sleep possible.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400]   I switched to using a Helix mattress
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.880]   and Helix pillow this last year,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.580]   and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640]   The way that Helix mattresses work,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.720]   and the reason they're different,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   is that they are tailored to your individual sleep style.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.160]   You take a brief two-minute questionnaire quiz,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.240]   ask you questions like, do you sleep on your back
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   or your side or your stomach?
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.320]   Maybe you don't know,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.560]   maybe you move around a lot during the night.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.360]   It also asks you questions such as,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.160]   do you tend to run hot or wake up cold?
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.300]   Things of that sort.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.000]   And then they tailor a particular mattress
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   to your sleep needs.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.540]   For me, I matched to the so-called DUSK mattress,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.480]   and I love it.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.020]   I sleep better than ever.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.060]   And right now, if you wanna try Helix Sleep,
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.120]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.400]   And if you do that,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.160]   you'll get $200 off your order plus two free pillows.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.260]   They also have a great warranty.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.660]   They have a 10-year warranty on their mattresses.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.820]   If you don't like the mattress for any reason,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.000]   they'll pick it up for free from your home.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.580]   And they just make the whole thing really easy to try
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.200]   and determine whether or not it's right for you.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.440]   So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.060]   to get $200 off and two free pillows on your first order.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.920]   Some of you have asked how you can help support the podcast
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.520]   in yet other ways besides just checking out our sponsors.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.080]   We really appreciate the question,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.120]   and we've set up a Patreon account
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720]   at patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.060]   which allows you to donate to the podcast
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.880]   at a variety of different levels.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   We have, for instance, the 5HTP,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.260]   which is in honor of serotonin,
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.720]   5HTP is the name for serotonin,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.600]   that allows you to donate $5 per month.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.580]   We have the Circadian,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.320]   which as many of you, of course, will know is 24-hour day.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.900]   So you can donate $24 a month if you like.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.800]   You can also pick any value that you want.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.780]   We even have the Costello, which is $10 a month,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.520]   which allows you to support the podcast
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.640]   in honor of Costello, the fact that he's 10 years old,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.380]   that he eats 10 pounds of food a day,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.900]   and the fact that he takes 10 one-hour naps per day
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.920]   on average.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.120]   So again, that's patreon.com/andrewhuberman
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360]   if you'd like to support the podcast that way.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.640]   Today's episode is going to be all about
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.580]   the science of emotions.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.960]   The first month of the podcast,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.440]   we talked about sleep and wakefulness.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.600]   Last month, we were talking about neuroplasticity,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.840]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.420]   And this month, we're going to talk about
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.960]   these things that we call emotions.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.920]   We're going to decipher what they are, how they work,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.520]   how we can control them,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.740]   when we might not want to control them.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.320]   There are going to be four episodes on emotions.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.400]   And today, we're going to talk in particular
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.940]   about something that most often is called stress.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.120]   You might be thinking, wait, stress isn't an emotion,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.860]   but stress really lies at the heart
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.060]   of whether or not our internal experience
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.020]   is matched well or not to our external experience
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.180]   or the events that are happening to us and around us.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.220]   And as you'll soon see, those converge or combine
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.340]   to create what we call emotions.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.740]   Now, I want to be very clear
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.960]   that we're going to talk about the biology of emotions.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.220]   We're going to talk a little bit about
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.120]   some psychological concepts related to emotion.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.160]   And we are definitely going to talk about tools
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.280]   to control what we call stress
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.800]   or commonly think of as stress.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.580]   We're also going to clean up some common myths about stress.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.500]   For instance, that stress impairs your immune system.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.480]   That's true in certain contexts.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.560]   And in other contexts,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.500]   stress actually enhances your immune system
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.480]   and makes it function better.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.440]   There is going to be a lot of discussion
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.040]   about whether or not our internal state,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.540]   whether or not we are alert or calm,
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.360]   is good or bad depending on the circumstances.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.660]   So where we're headed here
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.720]   is I'd like you to come away from today's episode
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.620]   with what I call an organizational logic,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.460]   a framework for thinking about these things
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.700]   that typically we just call happy or sad
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.720]   or depressed or anxious.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.460]   And I'm going to make sure that you have tools
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.240]   that are grounded in physiology and neuroscience
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.120]   that will allow you to navigate
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   this otherwise complex space that we call emotions
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.780]   that will allow you to ground yourself better
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.500]   when you're feeling like life is weighing on you
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.560]   or you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.760]   as well as to support other people,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.960]   whether or not that's in a psychological practice
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.020]   if you're a practitioner
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.680]   or you have clients or children or spouses,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.360]   really to be able to support other people
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.440]   in your environment better.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.160]   And the tools that I'm going to focus on today
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.220]   range from behavioral tools.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.000]   We will talk about some of the more valuable
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.520]   supplementation tools that are out there.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.240]   And we're going to talk a little bit about things
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.900]   like depression, PTSD,
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.760]   but we will be devoting entire episodes
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.060]   to things like depression, PTSD,
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.080]   and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.880]   which believe it or not,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.080]   although this might not surprise many of you,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.360]   have a very strong emotional component.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.600]   It's just not just about compulsive behaviors
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.520]   and intrusive thoughts.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.220]   It's also about the emotional load of being in that state.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.560]   So I promise that today we're going to clean up
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.780]   a lot of misunderstanding.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.120]   We're going to give you a lot of tools
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.760]   and you're going to learn a lot about the biology
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.500]   of how your body and brain work together.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.860]   Because if ever there was a topic
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.380]   that brought together the brain and body
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.660]   or mind-body relationship,
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.020]   it's stress and emotions.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.440]   It's also the positive emotions.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.140]   When we feel something, whether or not we're super happy
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.960]   or just feeling kind of pleasant,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.920]   or we are feeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.360]   it isn't just in our head, it's also in our body.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.500]   And as you may recall, the nervous system,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.400]   which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.700]   but also all the connections with the organs of the body
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.500]   includes the brain and body.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.980]   And those organs of the body,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.900]   your gut and your liver and your spleen,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.140]   they're also communicating with the brain.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.000]   So I look forward to a day, in fact,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.680]   when we no longer think about neuroscience
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.780]   as just the brain.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.260]   And many neuroscientists now also think about the body,
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.240]   of course, the brain controls the body,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.340]   but the body is also having a very profound
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.140]   and concrete influence on the brain.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.260]   I think up until recently,
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.820]   people would hear about kind of brain-body
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.220]   and always think about mindfulness.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.340]   We're actually not gonna talk that much about mindfulness
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.320]   at all today.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.380]   Mindfulness is kind of a vague concept, in fact.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.820]   When you think about mindfulness,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.140]   it's good to take the opposite.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.540]   What's the opposite of mindfulness would be mindlessness.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.500]   Well, all of a sudden we're into territory
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.460]   that isn't really easy for one person
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.980]   to describe their experience
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.140]   or to help others with their experience.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.240]   Today, we're gonna talk about objective tools
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.980]   that match the brain-body experience
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.740]   or separate the brain-body experience
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.420]   in ways that leverage your ability
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.600]   to lean into life better, to feel better,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.580]   literally to just feel better about what you're experiencing
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.420]   and believe it or not,
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.340]   to be able to control your emotions when that's appropriate.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.220]   This isn't about becoming robotic.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.660]   This isn't about trying not to feel human.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.940]   This is actually about being able to lean into life better
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.060]   as a consequence of being able to control
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.140]   some of your inner real estate,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.400]   this nervous system that includes the brain and body
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.180]   and how that nervous system
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.860]   is interacting with the outside world.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.660]   So it's to place you in a greater position of power.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.180]   And so let's get started in deciphering what is stress?
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.540]   What are emotions?
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.180]   And why did I batch stress and emotions
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.700]   into one discussion today?
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.860]   Okay, so what is stress?
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.700]   We hear all the time that stress is bad.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.040]   We hear people saying they're really stressed out.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.700]   What is stress?
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.380]   You've all presumably heard the arguments or the framework
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.540]   that stress is this horrible ancient carryover
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.360]   from times in which humans were pursued by animals
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.480]   or other human predators.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.780]   And that whenever we feel what we call stress
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.180]   or feel stressed out,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.100]   that it's just this unfortunate invasion
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.020]   of something that we no longer need in modern life,
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.820]   that this was designed for when we were being attacked
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.900]   by bears or tigers or lions or whatever it is.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.420]   And gosh, what an unfortunate thing.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.140]   And we have so many creature comforts nowadays,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.780]   but we have not eliminated this stress.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.340]   Almost as if it was like an organ or a system in our body
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.980]   that was bad for us that we're stuck with
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.460]   just because of the species that we are.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.040]   But first of all, all species experience stress.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.720]   And I think that it's fair to say,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.360]   even though I wasn't there,
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.820]   that yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history,
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.540]   we were vulnerable to animal attack and other human attacks
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.820]   on a regular basis up until a point
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.260]   where we started developing weapons and structures and fire
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.620]   and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.860]   from those animals and invaders of various kinds.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.340]   But it is entirely naive for us to think
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.540]   that in ancient times,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.420]   ancient times being a kind of loose term for previous time,
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.660]   medieval times, 100 years ago, a thousand years ago,
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.940]   10,000 years ago, of course there were infidelities, right?
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.540]   Partners cheated, people died.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.820]   In fact, before the advent of phones,
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.420]   which we're gonna talk about today,
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.560]   you can imagine that someone might head off on a hunt
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.740]   or to go visit a relative and never come back
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.020]   and you would never know why.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.420]   That would be very stressful.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.340]   So there was psychosocial stress.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.380]   There was a stress of losing loved ones.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.120]   There was the stress of cold, of famine.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.120]   There was the stress probably also of just worry.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.580]   This idea that ancient versions of humans
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.900]   a thousand years ago, a hundred years ago didn't worry.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.500]   I think that is entirely inconsistent
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.040]   with everything we know about the structure
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.200]   of the human brain a hundred years, a thousand years ago.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.220]   So all the problems that we're struggling with
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.260]   existed forever.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.060]   It's just that stress at its core is a generalized system.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.140]   It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.520]   or people attacking us.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.300]   It's a system to mobilize other systems
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.820]   in the brain and body.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.020]   That's what stress really is.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.780]   It's designed to be generic.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.360]   And that's the most important thing
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.580]   that I'd like you to understand today
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.260]   is that the system that governs what we call stress
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.900]   is generic.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.300]   It wasn't designed for one thing.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.780]   And that gives it a certain advantage
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.220]   in taking over the state of our brain and body.
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.020]   But it also gives you, all of us,
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.240]   an advantage in controlling it
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   because it's based on hardwired biological mechanisms.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.020]   And there are hardwired biological mechanisms,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.920]   meaning cells and chemicals and pathways and tissues
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.280]   that exist in you right now
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.780]   that require no neuroplasticity
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.980]   that allow you to put a brake on stress.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.040]   And so we're gonna talk about those.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.700]   So you have a system for stress
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.500]   and you have a system for de-stress
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.740]   that are baked into you.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.400]   They were genetically encoded
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.840]   and you were born with them and you still have them now.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.920]   So if you're alive and listening,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.500]   you have the capacity to control your stress.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.380]   And today I'm gonna talk about ways
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.900]   that you can control your stress,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.420]   not just by doing some offline practice
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.820]   of meditation or breath work or something like that,
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.600]   but real-time tools,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.140]   tools that allow you to push back on stress
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.260]   when stress hits in real time.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.920]   You know, this is something that my lab works actively on
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.580]   in developing and testing these tools
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.500]   and evolving these tools.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.940]   And there are other laboratories that do this as well.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.100]   So let's talk about the stress response.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.600]   And by doing that,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.980]   you will understand exactly why the tools
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.380]   I'm gonna give you work.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.760]   For those of you that are saying,
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.860]   "Wait, I just want the tools, just give me a summary."
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.920]   Trust me, if you understand mechanism,
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.020]   you are going to be in a far better position
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.940]   to incorporate these tools, to teach these tools to others,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.440]   and to modify them as your life circumstances change.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.980]   If you'd like the cheat sheet,
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.820]   or you just want the one-page PDF,
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.420]   eventually we'll get that stuff out to people,
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.820]   but it's really important
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.380]   to understand the underlying mechanism.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.280]   Okay, so what is stress?
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.980]   Well, let's just distinguish between stressors,
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.640]   which are the things that stress us out,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.100]   and stress, which is the psychological
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.180]   and physiological response to stressors.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.640]   I'm mainly gonna talk about stress,
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.240]   which is your response to things.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.480]   Let's be clear about what we already know,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.400]   which is that stressors can be psychological,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.640]   or they can be physical, okay?
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.160]   If I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.040]   for a very long time, that is stressful.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.680]   If I have you prepare for too many exams at once,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.960]   and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.400]   and your other needs for comfort and wellbeing,
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.660]   like food, rest, sleep, and social connection,
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.680]   that is stressful.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.600]   So stress, and as I mentioned before, is generic.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.700]   It doesn't distinguish between physical
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.220]   and emotional stress.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.340]   So what happens when the stress response hits?
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.060]   Let's talk about the immediate,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.720]   or what we call the acute stress response.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.840]   We could also think of this as a short-term stress.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.980]   So you have a collection of neurons.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.980]   They have a name.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.020]   It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia,
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.880]   and it has nothing to do with sympathy.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.240]   Simpa means together, and there's a group of neurons
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   that start right about at your neck
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.360]   and run down to about your navel, a little bit lower,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.780]   and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.440]   You don't need to memorize that name.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.820]   There will not be a quiz, but it's important to know
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.060]   that in the middle of your body, you have a chain of neurons
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.500]   that when something stresses us out, either in our mind
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.640]   or because something enters our environment
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.240]   and we see something that stresses us out
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.440]   that we don't like heights if you're afraid of heights,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.560]   somebody you dislike walks into the room, et cetera,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.840]   that chain of neurons becomes activated
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.060]   like a bunch of dominoes falling all at once.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.760]   It's very fast.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.500]   When that happens, those neurons release a neuromodulator,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.180]   neurochemical that I've talked about before
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.480]   on this podcast called acetylcholine.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.360]   They release that at various sites within the body.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.060]   Now, this is important because normally acetylcholine
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.980]   would be used to move muscles.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.640]   Actually, every time we move a muscle,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.800]   pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen,
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.600]   walk down the street, it's spinal neurons connecting
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.400]   to muscle and releasing acetylcholine.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.280]   So in the brain, it's involved in focus
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.240]   and at muscles, it's involved in making muscles twitch.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.560]   But if we were stressed, we wouldn't want all our muscles
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.180]   to contract at once because we would just be paralyzed
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.280]   like this in what tonic activation as it's called.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.480]   We wouldn't want that, something called tetanus,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.200]   believe it or not, because the tetanus toxin
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.000]   will cause that kind of rigor of the entire body.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.040]   You do not want that.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.520]   When those neurons are activated, acetylcholine is released,
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.040]   but there are some other neurons
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.060]   for the aficionados out there.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.080]   They're called the postganglionic neurons.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.400]   Those ones respond to that acetylcholine
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.860]   and then they release epinephrine,
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.540]   which is the equivalent to adrenaline.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.360]   So we have this system where very fast,
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.760]   whenever we're stressed, the core of our body,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.240]   these neurons down the middle of our body
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.800]   release these chemicals and then there's adrenaline
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.220]   or epinephrine released at particular organs
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.900]   and acts in particular ways.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.440]   We're going down into the weeds here, so just stay with me
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.680]   'cause it's going to make a lot of sense
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.360]   and you will appreciate having this knowledge in hand.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.260]   That epinephrine acts in two different ways.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.240]   Some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.220]   and other things that need to be active
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.400]   when you're stressed, they have a certain kind of receptor,
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.540]   which is called the beta receptor
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.740]   and that beta receptor responds to epinephrine
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.580]   and blood vessels dilate, they get bigger
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.980]   and blood rushes in to our legs.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.000]   The heart rate speeds up.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.300]   Lots of things happen, they get activated.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.160]   And at the same time, that epinephrine activates
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.740]   other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need,
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.200]   the ones involved in digestion, reproduction
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.100]   and things of that sort that are luxuries
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.680]   for when things are going well,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.320]   not things to pay attention to when we're stressed
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.600]   and that binds to other receptors
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.800]   that contract the blood vessels.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.900]   So basically the stress response,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.940]   this is the key phrase here, the stress response,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.360]   A is generic, I said that before
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   and B, it basically pushes certain systems to be activated
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.160]   and other systems to not be activated.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.320]   So the stress response is two-pronged.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.240]   It's a yes for certain things
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.140]   and it's a no, you may not right now for other things.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.640]   So that's the key thing to understand
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   about the stress response.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.980]   That's why your heart speeds up.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.880]   That's why you feel blood in certain organs
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   and tissues of your body, but not in others.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040]   That's why your throat goes dry,
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   because it turns out that when you get stressed,
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.620]   the salivary glands are shut down.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.320]   There's a lot less blood flow to the neurons
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.200]   that control salivation.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.720]   And so you're gonna start swallowing.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.580]   You feel like your throat is getting dry.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.720]   There are a lot of different effects.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   I'm not gonna list them all off,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.760]   but basically you are activated
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.240]   in ways that support you moving.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.640]   So that's the third thing.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.600]   First of all, it's generic.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.640]   Second of all, the stress response activates certain things
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.720]   and shuts down other features of our body.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.280]   And then it's a sense of agitation
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.960]   that makes you wanna move.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.040]   And that's because fundamentally the stress response
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.600]   is just this generic thing that says, do something.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   And movement in this case can either be the bias to move
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.520]   in terms of action, or it can be the bias to say something.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.880]   When we are stressed, we are more likely to say something
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.600]   that probably we shouldn't say.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.120]   We are more likely to move.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.560]   And if you're trying to suppress movement,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.600]   you'll feel that as a tremor.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.840]   You're gonna feel agitated
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.300]   and that's because it was designed to move you.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.700]   So this is important because if you wanna control stress,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.180]   you need to learn how to work with that agitation.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.340]   I'd like to give you a tool at this point
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.040]   because I think if we go any further
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.060]   with a lot more science, people are gonna begin to wonder
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.140]   if this is just gonna be a kind of standard university
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.780]   lecture about the stress response.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.380]   I'm gonna give you more science about the stress response,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.780]   but I want to take what we now already know
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.540]   about the stress response and use that as a framework
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.540]   for thinking about how one might reduce
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.400]   or even eliminate the stress response quickly in real time
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.100]   should it arise when we don't want it.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.380]   So we're taking the podium or we're sitting down
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.960]   at a Zoom call and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.640]   We're feeling like our heart is racing.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.200]   We're feeling a little too alert.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.440]   We're feeling a little worked up and we wanna calm down.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.400]   As far as I am aware of, the best tools
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.900]   to reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.600]   are going to be tools that have a direct line
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.760]   to the so-called autonomic nervous system.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.040]   The autonomic nervous system is a name given
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.660]   to the kind of general features of alertness
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.220]   or calmness in the body.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.220]   It's typically, it means automatic,
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.800]   although we do have some control over it,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.020]   certain what so-called levers or entry points.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.660]   Here's what doesn't work to control stress,
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.420]   telling yourself to calm down.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.140]   In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.460]   Telling someone else to calm down
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.480]   also tends to exacerbate their stress.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.320]   If you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response,
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.460]   the best thing you can do is activate the other system
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.680]   in the body, which is designed for calming and relaxation.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.720]   And that system is called the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.080]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.400]   the neurons that control stress
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.680]   run from about your neck to your navel.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.520]   The parasympathetic neurons, para just means near,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.680]   exist in, they are some of the cranial nerves,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.440]   so it's kind of neck and lower brainstem,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.460]   kind of back of the brain and in the neck,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.520]   and in the pelvic area.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.840]   And the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.780]   is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.840]   the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neck area,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.180]   those have a direct line to various features of your face,
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.000]   in particular, the eyes.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.640]   They control things like eye movements,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.680]   pupil dilation, things of that sort,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.800]   as well as the tongue, the facial muscles, et cetera.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.360]   The parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.840]   many people don't realize this,
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.400]   is the system by which we control the face and the eyes,
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.740]   and to some extent our airway, the trachea.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:40.440]   And it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic area.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.160]   Now, the neurons within the pelvic area
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.380]   are involved in control of the genitals,
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.600]   the bladder, and the rectum.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.440]   And those don't have a direct line.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.740]   You don't have a direct way to control those.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.660]   It actually has to go from brain to spinal cord
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.120]   and then out to those organs.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.660]   Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.680]   has certain entry points, or what I'll call levers, right,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.360]   that will allow you to push back on the stress response
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.480]   in real time and diminish it
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.280]   and feel more relaxed really quickly.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.520]   So I'm going to teach you the first tool now
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.840]   so I don't overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.940]   without giving you something useful.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.180]   And the tool that, at least to my knowledge,
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.920]   is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.480]   in physiology and neuroscience
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.400]   for calming down in a self-directed way
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.240]   is what's called the physiological PSI, S-I-G-H.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.200]   Now, some of you might've heard me talk about this
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.960]   on previous podcasts, but I'm going to explain this
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.380]   in the context of how respiration in general
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.880]   is used to calm us down.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.600]   And it turns out you're all doing this all the time,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.040]   but you are doing it involuntarily.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.180]   And when you stress, you tend to forget
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.420]   that you can also activate these systems voluntarily.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.960]   This is an extremely powerful set of techniques
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.500]   that we know from scientific studies
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.560]   that are being done in my lab,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.400]   Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA, and others now
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   that are very, very useful
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.280]   for reducing your stress response in real time.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.480]   And here's how they work.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.960]   These days, there seems to be a lot of interest
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.180]   in breath work.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.140]   Breath work typically is when you go and you sit down
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.440]   or you lie down and you deliberately breathe
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.960]   in a particular way for a series of minutes
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.600]   in order to shift your physiology, access some states,
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.360]   and it does have some utility that we're going to talk about.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.900]   That is not what I'm talking about now.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.920]   What I'm talking about when I refer to physiological size
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.860]   is the very real medical school textbook relationship
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.560]   between the brain, the body,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.020]   and the body as it relates to the breathing apparatus,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.280]   meaning the diaphragm and lungs, and the heart.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.580]   Let's take the hallmark of the stress response.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.160]   The heart starts beating faster.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.000]   Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the body
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.460]   to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.720]   or just make you feel like you need to move or talk.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.040]   Your face goes flushed, et cetera.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.260]   Heart rate, many of us feel is involuntary,
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.580]   just kind of functions whether or not we're moving fast
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.420]   or moving slow.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.520]   If you think about it, it's not really purely autonomic
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.940]   because you can speed up your heart rate by running
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.800]   or you can slow it down by slowing down, by your run.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.760]   You can move to a walk or lie down,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.800]   but that's indirect control.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.180]   There is, however, a way in which you can breathe
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.040]   that directly controls your heart rate
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.160]   through the interactions between the sympathetic
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.600]   and the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.340]   Here's how it works.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.440]   When you inhale,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.800]   so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   this skeletal muscle that's inside your body
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.280]   called the diaphragm, it moves down.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.920]   And that's because the lungs expand,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.320]   the diaphragm moves down.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.040]   Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.420]   in that expanded space.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.800]   There's more space for the heart.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.340]   So I'm not talking about your emotional heart
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.180]   getting bigger.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.920]   I'm talking about your actual physical heart
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.840]   getting a little bit bigger.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.880]   The volume grows.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.900]   And as a consequence, whatever blood is in there
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.880]   is now at a lower volume
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.160]   or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.440]   than it was before you inhaled.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.320]   So more space, heart gets bigger, blood moves more slowly,
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.040]   and there's a little group of neurons
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   called the sinoatrial node in the heart that registers,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.200]   believe it or not, those neurons pay attention
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.480]   to the rate of blood flow through the heart
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.260]   and send a signal up to the brain
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.620]   that blood is moving more slowly through the heart.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.340]   The brain then sends a signal back to the heart
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.180]   to speed the heart up.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.820]   So what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.560]   Now, there are a variety of ways that one could do that,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.140]   but it doesn't matter if it's through the nose
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   or through the mouth.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.800]   If your inhales are longer than your exhales,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.820]   you're speeding up your heart.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.220]   If your inhales are more vigorous,
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.560]   so even if your inhales are shorter than your exhales,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.920]   you are speeding up your heart rate.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.440]   Now, the opposite is also true.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.360]   If you want to slow your heart rate down,
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.960]   so stress response hits,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.240]   you want to slow your heart rate down,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.800]   what you want to do is, again,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.560]   capitalize on this relationship between the body,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.760]   meaning the diaphragm in the heart and the brain.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.600]   Here's how it works.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.440]   When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.720]   which makes the heart a little bit smaller.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.240]   It actually gets a little more compact.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.580]   Blood flows more quickly through that compact space,
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.500]   sort of like it's just a pipe getting smaller.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.240]   The sinoatrial node registers
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.620]   that blood is going more quickly,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.080]   sends a signal up to the brain,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.280]   and the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.160]   some neurons in your brain stem,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.180]   send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   So if you want to calm down quickly,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.820]   you need to make your exhales longer
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.200]   and/or more vigorous than your inhales.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.240]   Now, the reason this is so attractive
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.640]   as a tool for controlling stress
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.400]   is that it works in real time.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.920]   This doesn't involve a practice
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.320]   that you have to go and sit there
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   and do anything separate from life.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.200]   And we are going to get to emotion.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.960]   Emotions and stress happen in real time.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.720]   And so while it's wonderful to have a breath work practice
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.000]   or to have the opportunity to get a massage
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.300]   or sit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.600]   in order to set your stress controls in the right direction,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.920]   having tools that you can reach to in real time
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.360]   that require no learning.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.800]   I mean, I had to teach it to you, you had to learn that,
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.280]   but it doesn't require any plasticity
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.660]   to activate these pathways.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.200]   So if you're feeling stressed,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.840]   you still need to inhale, of course,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.580]   but you need to lengthen your exhales.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.160]   Now, there's a tool that capitalizes on this
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.960]   in a kind of unique way, a kind of a twist,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.640]   which is the physiological psi.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.200]   The physiological psi was discovered in the '30s.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.480]   It's now been explored at the neurobiological level
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.980]   and mechanistically in far more detail by Jack Feldman's lab
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.820]   at UCLA, also Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.100]   And the physiological psi is something that humans
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.640]   and animals do anytime they are about to fall asleep.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.080]   You also do it throughout sleep from time to time
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.280]   when carbon dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.260]   builds up too much in your system.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.280]   And the physiological psi is something
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.120]   that people naturally start doing when they've been crying
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.160]   and they're trying to recover some air or calm down,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.060]   when they've been sobbing very hard,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.440]   or when they are in claustrophobic environments.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.480]   However, the amazing thing about this thing
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.360]   that we call the diaphragm, the skeletal muscle,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.780]   is that it's an internal organ
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.320]   that you can control voluntarily,
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.200]   unlike your spleen or your heart or your pancreas,
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.020]   where you can't just say,
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.200]   "Oh, I want to make my pancreas
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.580]   "turn out a little more insulin right now.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.680]   "I'm just going to do that with my mind directly."
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.520]   You can't do that.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.400]   You could do that by smelling
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.860]   a really good donut or something,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.720]   but you can't just do it directly.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.640]   You can move your diaphragm intentionally, right?
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.880]   You can do it anytime you want,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.020]   and it'll run in the background
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.920]   if you're not thinking about it.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.160]   So this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.720]   through what's called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.880]   phrenic, the phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.360]   You can control anytime you want.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.800]   You can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.960]   You can exhale more than your inhales,
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.600]   whatever you want to do.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.800]   Such an incredible organ.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.920]   And the physiological sigh
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.720]   is something that we do spontaneously,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.640]   but when you're feeling stressed,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.860]   you can do a double inhale,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.280]   [inhales]
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.520]   [exhales]
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.420]   long exhale.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.900]   Now, I just told you a minute ago
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   that if you inhale more than you exhale,
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.600]   you're going to speed the heart rate up,
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.100]   which would promote more stress and activation.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.400]   Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale exhale
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.040]   in order to calm down.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.000]   And the reason is the double inhale exhale,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.860]   which is the physiological sigh,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.560]   takes advantage of the fact
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.960]   that when we do a double inhale,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.780]   even if the second inhale is sneaking in
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.220]   just a tiny bit more air,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.080]   'cause it's kind of hard to get two deep inhales
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.920]   back to back.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.760]   You do big, deep inhale,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.800]   and then another little one sneaking it in.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.680]   The little sacs in your lungs, the avioli of the lungs,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.080]   your lungs aren't just two big bags,
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.780]   but you've got millions of little sacs
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.920]   throughout the lungs
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.020]   that actually make the surface area of your lungs
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.640]   as big as a tennis court.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.080]   It's amazing if we were to just spread that out.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.160]   Those tend to collapse as we get stressed,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.320]   and carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream,
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.340]   and that's one of the reasons we feel agitated as well.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.760]   So, and it makes us very jittery.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.600]   I mean, there's some other effects of carbon dioxide
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.720]   I don't want to get into,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.960]   but when you do the double inhale exhale,
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.720]   the double inhale reinflates
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   those little sacs of the lungs,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.760]   and then when you do the long exhale,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.920]   that long exhale is now much more effective
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.280]   at ridding your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide,
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.560]   which relaxes you very quickly.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.120]   My lab in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab,
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.100]   David's the associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford,
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.540]   are doing a study right now,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.000]   exploring how physiological size
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.640]   and other patterns of breathing done deliberately
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.320]   can modulate the stress response
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.240]   and other things related to emotionality.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.620]   Those work are ongoing.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.700]   I want to be clear, those studies aren't done,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.200]   but it's very clear from work in our labs,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.000]   from working with Jack Feldman's lab and others,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   that the physiological sigh is the fastest hardwired way
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.480]   for us to eliminate this stressful response
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.640]   in our body quickly in real time.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.300]   And so I'm excited to give you this tool
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.700]   because I think most people have heard
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.240]   that mindfulness and meditation is good,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.360]   exercise is good for us,
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.560]   we all need to be getting enough sleep, et cetera,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.920]   but life happens.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.240]   And when you find yourself in a position
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.180]   where you are more alert and activated
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.240]   than you would like to be,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.000]   regardless of whether or not the stressor
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.280]   is relationship-based or it's financial
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.980]   or it's physical or anything like that,
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.900]   you can look to the physiological side
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.260]   because it bypasses a very important feature
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.100]   of how we function,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.900]   which is that it's very hard to control the mind
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.800]   with the mind,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.400]   especially when we are in heightened states of activation.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.740]   When we are very alert or very sleepy,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.080]   it is very hard to use these so-called top-down mechanisms
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.800]   of intention and gratitude and all these things
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.700]   that are really powerful tools
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.600]   when we are not super activated and stressed
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.300]   or not super tired.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.800]   But when we are anywhere in the range
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.560]   of very alert and stressed to very sleepy,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.840]   physiological sides are a powerful way
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.840]   of bringing our level of so-called autonomic activation,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.200]   which just means our level of alertness down.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.980]   And so whether or not it's in line at the bank
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.440]   or whether or not you're wearing a mask nowadays
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.600]   or you're not, whatever the conditions may be
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.320]   where you're at and your needs,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.300]   when you're feeling stressed,
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.340]   the physiological side done just one to three times,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.600]   so it'd be double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.040]   maybe just two times,
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.840]   will bring down your level of stress very, very fast.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.660]   And as far as I know,
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.160]   it's the fastest way to accomplish that.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.320]   An important note about the physiological side
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.440]   or exhale-emphasized breathing
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.600]   for lowering the stress response.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.560]   Many people worry that their heart rate
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.620]   does not come down fast enough.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.360]   I want to tell you,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.560]   you do not want your heart rate to reduce very fast.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.220]   There's actually something called the vasovagal response
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.320]   where people will stand up
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.360]   or they'll get up in the middle of the night
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   to use the bathroom,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.260]   and then all of a sudden they'll collapse, they'll faint.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.800]   That's because the heart rate was reduced too much.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.120]   Some people will see blood
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.640]   or they'll see something really troubling and stressful
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.800]   and they'll pass out.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   That's an over-activation
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.520]   or an acceleration of the calming response.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.440]   They're not so stressed
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.140]   that they kind of fall off the cliff of stress.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.900]   They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.600]   for calming themselves down goes too high, too fast.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.400]   They calm down too fast and they collapse and faint.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.440]   And so be aware that if you're going to use
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.020]   the physiological side or exhale-emphasized breathing
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.480]   to calm down,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.420]   that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.280]   to come down to baseline.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.440]   And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.260]   a few times.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.120]   So that's an important note about the use of breathing
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   to control levels of stress.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.520]   to control the mind,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.580]   it does something else that's very powerful.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.840]   When you are stressed in your mind and body,
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.060]   so you're feeling really agitated, activated, and worried,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.040]   and you use a tool like the physiological sigh
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.060]   or exhale-emphasized breathing,
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.820]   you will notice that then your brain and your mind
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.760]   becomes more available for controlling the stress response
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.840]   and reacting to it,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.620]   which is great because the sweet spot in life is to be,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.900]   provided you're not trying to sleep,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.640]   is to be alert and calm.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.560]   And so that's the idea is to be alert and calm
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.460]   and to bring you back into that sort of plane of alertness.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.420]   For those of you that have trouble sleeping
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.480]   or just relaxing through the day,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.680]   the physiological side can be repeated
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.360]   for 10, 15 cycles if you like.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.920]   Some people find that it actually puts them to sleep.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.840]   So if they lie down and they're reading
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.000]   and they do too many of these,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.280]   that actually can put them to sleep.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.240]   And what you'll find is that most breath work protocols,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.620]   the kind of stuff that's done away from real life
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.960]   that you set aside time
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.480]   and decide to do quote-unquote breath work,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.520]   most of that works such that if you're doing inhales
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.260]   that are longer and more vigorous than exhales,
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.840]   it tends to be activating and alert you.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.200]   And if you're doing exhales
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.380]   that are longer and more vigorous than the inhales,
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.360]   it tends to put you to sleep.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.560]   And many of the protocols that are out there
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.900]   from laboratories and that populate the internet
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.560]   and wellness sites and whatnot,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.120]   if it's exhale-emphasized breathing,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.920]   oftentimes it's been used as a tool
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.980]   for trying to teach people to fall asleep.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.460]   Physiological side is a little different.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.760]   It's designed to be used in real time.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.140]   Just think of it as just kind of in your kit of things
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.160]   that you can do as life happens
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.320]   and as you need to react to life.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.960]   A note about nasal versus mouth breathing.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.240]   There's a plethora of information out there now
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   because of James Nestor's book, "Breath,"
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.380]   The New Science of a Lost Art,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.440]   which came out this last year, excellent book,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.200]   as well as "Jaws," which is from Sandra Kahn, Paul Ehrlich,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.600]   with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   So a collection of people from Stanford.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.960]   Jared Diamond's not at Stanford, but the rest are.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.920]   And some heavy hitters on that book,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.560]   which is about the benefits of nasal breathing.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   And in many cases, nasal breathing is more advantageous
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.780]   than mouth breathing for all sorts of things,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.160]   cosmetic features of the face,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   especially in kids, warding off infection.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.400]   Et cetera.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.280]   With the physiological side,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.960]   the best way to do it would be double inhale
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.640]   through the nose, exhale through the mouth.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.480]   But if you can't,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.880]   and you can only do that through your mouth,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   just do it through your mouth.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.360]   If you want to do it all through your nose,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   do it through your nose.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.040]   This anchors back to some underlying neurology
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.280]   or neuroscience.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.720]   So for those of you that want to know,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.080]   you have two breathing centers,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.940]   one that's involved in rhythmic breathing
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.380]   for inhales followed by exhales,
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.860]   followed by inhales, followed by exhales,
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.420]   the so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus,
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.620]   named after a bottle of wine and discovered
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.020]   by Jack Feldman at UCLA,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.540]   and a nearby nucleus called the perifacial nucleus,
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.620]   also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.900]   And the perifacial nucleus is involved
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.620]   in any time you double up the inhales
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.840]   or double up the exhales.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.740]   It was designed so that you could breathe
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.880]   while you're speaking,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.100]   because you can't always go inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.140]   when you're speaking.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.000]   So I tell you this not to overwhelm you with knowledge,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.460]   but just know that when you double up your inhales
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.500]   or you double up your exhales,
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.700]   you are activating this perifacial nucleus,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.020]   and it has other cool effects.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.020]   Because it's located near the neurons
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.500]   that control the face,
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.740]   it also has a tendency to relax the jaw.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.180]   There's some interplay between the neurons
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.660]   that control the speaking stuff
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.840]   and the stuff for your tongue.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.220]   So all of a sudden, when we do this physiological side,
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.040]   we tap into neural circuitry
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.600]   that allows us to speak more clearly,
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.740]   to control the muscles of the face and jaw,
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.400]   maybe that means not saying certain things
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.940]   when we're stressed,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.100]   and just generally to relax.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.520]   And so this brings us back to the neuroscience
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.580]   of this parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:59.960]   this calming system that's been genetically encoded into us
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.540]   that we all have, regardless of who our parents are,
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.060]   which is that the neurons that control all this stuff,
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.460]   the face, the eyes, et cetera, are all working together.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.040]   And that's why when we get stressed,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.120]   it's hard for us to speak,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.060]   or we tend to jitter and these kinds of things,
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.980]   just like all the neurons that cause stress
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.020]   in the center of the spinal cord
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.740]   are working together to get our body activated.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.980]   Okay, a lot of science today,
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.240]   you've now got the physiological side as a tool,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.780]   you know that exhale-emphasized breathing
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.780]   will slow your heart down,
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.260]   and inhale-emphasized breathing will speed your heart up.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.660]   So let's think about something now,
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.620]   let's think about stress
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.700]   from not whether or not it's acute or chronic,
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.220]   whether or not it's good for us or bad for us,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.380]   but on three different timescales,
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.280]   because then we can arrive at what this is all about
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.640]   as it relates to emotions,
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.260]   because trust me, this has everything to do with emotions
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.740]   and whether or not you're functioning well emotionally,
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.400]   or you're not functioning well emotionally,
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.420]   whether or not you're coping or not coping.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.580]   So those are typically psychological terms
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.940]   and psychological discussions.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.600]   We are entering this through the portal of physiology,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.180]   the stuff of medical textbooks,
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.360]   and we will arrive at the psychology soon,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.100]   but I really want you to understand the difference
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.980]   between the three kinds of stress
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.440]   on three different timescales,
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.960]   short-term, medium-term, and long-term,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.900]   and what it's good for and what it's bad for.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.180]   I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us.
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.460]   We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us,
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.620]   and indeed they are frightening.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.700]   You see the nice really plump brain on the left,
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.140]   it says healthy or control,
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.260]   and then you see the brain that says stressed above it
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.480]   on the right, and it's like withered,
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.080]   or we see that the hippocampus,
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.480]   an area involved in memory is smaller,
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.820]   people that are stressed.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.320]   We see that the Alzheimer's brain is made worse by stress,
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.400]   that people who have a predisposition of schizophrenia
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.240]   when they get stressed,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.380]   higher incidence of schizophrenic episodes.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.560]   You hear that addicts will relapse when they're stressed.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.460]   I mean, okay, we get it, and it's very important,
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.540]   but I think we've all heard now so many times
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.660]   that stress is bad, but in that conversation,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.020]   unfortunately, it's eclipsed
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.960]   some of the really positive things
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.940]   that stress does for us in the short-term.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.700]   So stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   Long-term stress is indeed bad
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.460]   for all the reasons I just mentioned and many others,
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.980]   but what's never actually been discussed
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.860]   is what stress is so terrific for,
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.200]   positive for in the short-term,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.980]   and I think we tend to overlook the important question,
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.680]   which is what is short-term and what is long-term?
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.820]   No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic,
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.060]   what is acute, right?
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.920]   Is it five minutes, is it five days,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.140]   is it for the duration of final exams,
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.780]   or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college?
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.300]   No one actually draws boundaries around this stuff
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.060]   or even general guidelines,
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.980]   and so it's become a bit of a mess, frankly,
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.500]   to try and decipher this whole space around stress,
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.180]   so I'm going to try and clean some of this up for you
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.540]   based on what we know from the scientific data.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:03.260]   First of all, acute stress.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.740]   When the stress response hits,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.020]   that is good for your immune system.
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.740]   I know that might be a tough pill to swallow,
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.860]   but it's absolutely true.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.020]   In fact, stress often comes
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.280]   in the form of bacterial or viral infection,
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.700]   and the stress response is in part organized
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.660]   to combat bacterial and viral infection.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.700]   There are pathways from the same brain centers
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.940]   that activate these neurons in your spinal cord
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.940]   to make you feel like you want to move.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.320]   There are other neurons in your brain
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.540]   that activate things like your spleen,
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.060]   which will deploy killer cells to go out
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.820]   and scavenge for incoming bacteria and viruses
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.500]   and try and eat them up and kill them,
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.700]   so short-term stress and the release of adrenaline
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.880]   in particular or epinephrine, same thing,
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   adrenaline epinephrine, is good for combating infection,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.260]   and this to me is just not discussed enough,
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.960]   so that's why I'm discussing it here,
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.820]   and it relates to a particular tool
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.940]   that many of you ask about,
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.820]   but I don't often get the opportunity to talk about
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.900]   in such an appropriate context.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.940]   It's not that it's ever inappropriate to talk about,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.280]   but what I'm about to talk about now
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.620]   is the use of, again, respiration, breathing,
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.620]   to somewhat artificially activate the stress response,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.400]   and that will accomplish two things, okay?
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.020]   I'll return to medium and long-term stress,
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.540]   but I want to say short-term stress is good
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.980]   because the dilation of the pupils,
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.620]   the changes in the optics of the eyes,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.160]   the quickening of the heart rate,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.860]   the sharpening of your cognition,
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.460]   and in fact, that short-term stress brings certain elements
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.120]   of the brain online that allow you to focus.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.300]   Now, it narrows your focus.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.640]   You're not good at seeing the so-called big picture,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.980]   but it narrows your focus.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.700]   It allows you to do these,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.180]   what I call duration path outcome types of analysis.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.740]   It allows you to evaluate your environment,
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.420]   evaluate what you need to do.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.460]   It primes your whole system for better cognition.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.180]   It primes your immune system to combat infection,
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.460]   and that all makes sense when you think about the fact
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.460]   that famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections,
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:14.340]   invaders, all of this stuff liberates a response in the body
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.240]   that's designed to get you to fight back
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.500]   against whatever stressor that happens to be,
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.580]   psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.340]   Again, the stress response is generic.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.340]   The tool takes advantage of the fact
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.860]   that when adrenaline is released in the body
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.580]   from the adrenals, it has the effect of also liberating
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.140]   a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs,
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.100]   in particular from the spleen, but from elsewhere as well,
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.580]   and interactions with the lymphatic system
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.260]   that combat infection.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:53.500]   The way this works in the real world is best captured
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.460]   by a study that can be mapped back
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.940]   to so-called Wim Hof breathing.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.180]   Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.140]   after the so-called Iceman Wim Hof.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.020]   Wim, of course, being this Dutch,
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.260]   I think he is self-titled daredevil,
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.740]   and indeed he has many, many Guinness Book of World Records
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.940]   for things like swimming under icebergs
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.400]   and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   and crossing the desert without water, et cetera,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   things that are quite dangerous
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.700]   if you don't know what you're doing,
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.780]   and Wim obviously survived, or I'm telling you he survived,
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.500]   but there are two components to a sort of breathing protocol
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.620]   that he developed that was based also
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.180]   on what's called TUMO breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.500]   So before Wim, there was TUMO breathing,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.180]   and many people call this now super oxygenation breathing,
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.400]   although the breath work aficionados will probably say,
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.940]   well, it's not super oxygenation
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.820]   'cause you're also blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.540]   What I'm talking about here, regardless of whether or not
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.580]   it's called Wim Hof, TUMO, or super oxygenation,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.740]   is rapid deliberate breathing.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.780]   So it's deliberate hyperventilation.
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.900]   Why would somebody want to do this?
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.300]   Well, deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.140]   So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.580]   Typically it's done in through the nose,
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.400]   out through the mouth,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.680]   although sometimes it's just through the mouth.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.580]   If you do that for 15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths,
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.940]   you will feel very alert.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.760]   People who have anxiety will feel anxious.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.320]   They might even have an anxiety attack.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.260]   However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.240]   feels that way.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.000]   And it's because that pattern of breathing,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.700]   rapid movements of the diaphragm,
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.280]   will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.420]   So it's the release of adrenaline.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.740]   I mentioned that Wim is also called the Iceman.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.280]   Well, that's because he actually discovered
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.380]   this pattern of breathing somewhat.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.780]   And again, it maps back to TUMO breathing
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.260]   by going into cold water.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.680]   When you go into cold water, that too is a stressor
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.820]   and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold water.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.020]   So if you get into an ice bath or a cold shower,
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:09.000]   you will immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.640]   Now, there are all sorts of things related to this
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.800]   about psychological control and stress thresholds
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.140]   that we'll talk about.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.680]   But I really want people to understand
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.620]   that when adrenaline is released in the body,
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.960]   you are in a better position to combat infections.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.280]   And so whether or not you breathe very quickly
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.680]   in these cycles of 25 breaths,
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.100]   and regardless of what you call it, doesn't matter,
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.280]   adrenaline is released.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.840]   If you take a cold shower, adrenaline is released.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.620]   If you go into an ice bath deliberately,
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.640]   and even if you do it non-deliberately,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.820]   adrenaline is released.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.020]   You are mimicking the stress response.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.040]   And that adrenaline serves to suppress
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.780]   or combat incoming infections.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.600]   And this was beautifully shown in a study
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.660]   that was published in a very fine journal,
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.660]   the "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.100]   for the US.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.360]   It's literally called
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.620]   "Proceedings of the National Academy of USA"
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.560]   to distinguish it from other proceedings
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.860]   of other national academies in other countries.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.460]   The way the experiment went
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.260]   is that people were injected with endotoxin,
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.500]   or in some cases they were injected with a bacterial wall
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.240]   that mimics infection.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   It gives you a fever.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.300]   It makes you feel nauseous.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.140]   It makes you feel sick.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.020]   It is not pleasant.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.180]   Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.140]   that looked very much like the pattern of breathing
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.340]   I described a moment ago
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.780]   of doing 25 deep inhales and exhales,
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.860]   followed by an exhale holding their breath, then repeating.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.380]   25 inhales, exhales, holding their breath.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.620]   So this would look something like this.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.020]   Or if you're listening, it sounds like,
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.300]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.920]   25, 30 times, you'll start feeling heated up.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.500]   You'll start feeling the adrenaline response.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.000]   You're liberating adrenaline in your body.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.640]   Then exhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds,
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.760]   and then repeat.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.640]   And then typically,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.360]   after doing three or four rounds of that,
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.640]   they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.960]   Now I want to emphasize,
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.740]   never, ever, ever do this anywhere near water.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.060]   People have passed out so-called shallow water breath out.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.900]   People have died.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.440]   Don't do it in the bathtub, don't do it in the hot tub.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.640]   Don't do it before swimming.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.000]   Please don't do it anywhere near water.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.120]   Please don't do it at all
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.360]   unless you get clearance to do it from your doctor,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.440]   because there are some pulmonary effects and whatnot.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.300]   And the breath holds should definitely not be done
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.480]   by anyone that has glaucoma
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.540]   or pressure concerns for the eyes.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.480]   But these repeated cycles of breathing
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.280]   that liberate adrenaline
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.240]   allowed the group that did that protocol
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.620]   to essentially experience zero symptoms
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:37.680]   from the injection of this E. coli, which is remarkable.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.720]   They had much reduced or no symptoms.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.000]   They didn't feel feverish.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.900]   They didn't feel sick.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.540]   They weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, which is remarkable,
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.240]   but makes total sense when you think about the fact
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.760]   that the short-term stress response
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.080]   that what's typically called the acute stress response
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.380]   is designed to combat all stressors.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.360]   In fact, were you to cut yourself very deeply
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   while out on a hike in the woods,
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.880]   the other thing that would happen
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.340]   is that there would be a rapid inflammation response.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.340]   And we always hear inflammation is bad.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.020]   Inflammation gives us Alzheimer's.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.540]   Inflammation is the worst thing.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.900]   But the swelling is associated,
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.680]   the inflammation is associated with the recruitment
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.200]   of things like macrophages
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.680]   or microglia if it's a neural tissue,
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.720]   cells in our brain and body
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.240]   whose job is to act like little ambulances
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.080]   and rush to that site and clean it up.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.540]   And indeed the inflammation response looks horrible.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.760]   It sounds horrible,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   but it's a great thing in the short term.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   You want to have that tissue marked as in trouble
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.720]   and you want the body and brain to react to it.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.520]   So if you're getting peaks in stress from time to time
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.100]   throughout your day or throughout your week,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.640]   you are in a better position to combat infection.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   You are in a better position to heal your wounds,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.180]   physical wounds.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:57.100]   Many great things happen in the stress response.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.560]   Now, of course, the stress response
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.160]   isn't always super intense.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.720]   Sometimes it's milder.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.600]   Sometimes it allows us to just focus on something
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.420]   'cause we have a deadline that can feel stressful,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.640]   but that's one of the reasons
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.000]   you procrastinators out there,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.760]   people always ask me,
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.080]   what can be done for procrastination?
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.480]   What can be done for procrastination
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.680]   is you can understand what's happening,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.740]   which is that you are self-imposing stress
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.000]   because stress acts like a drug.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.620]   It is a powerful nootropic.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.100]   I get asked about nootropics.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.440]   The most powerful nootropic or smart drug is stress.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.260]   It's the concern of failure.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.040]   It's the desire to do well.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.560]   It's the impending deadline.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.740]   It's the, oh my gosh, I have to do this thing now
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.580]   or I'm going to fail.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.140]   That is the best nootropic you will ever find.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.880]   That combined with a good night's sleep,
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.960]   which we'll talk about,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.180]   but we spend a whole month on sleep,
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.700]   so I don't want to backtrack too much, okay?
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.500]   So short-term stress, great.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.580]   The key is to be able to turn the stress response off
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.000]   when you're done, when you don't want that.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.920]   In fact, let's just really tamp down the relationship
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.000]   between the short-term or acute stress response
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.120]   and infection.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.840]   Many of us are familiar with the experience
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.080]   of work, work, work, work, work,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.640]   or taking care of a loved one,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.880]   or stress, stress, stress, stress,
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.040]   then we finally relax.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.600]   Maybe we even go on vacation,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.320]   like, oh, now I'm finally going to get the break,
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.760]   and then we get sick.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.420]   And that's because the adrenaline response crashed
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.340]   and your immune system crashed with it.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.740]   So please understand this.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.820]   Now, many of you might say, well, how long?
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.760]   Is it two hours?
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.600]   Is it three hours?
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.340]   A lot of you out there that really like specificity,
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.100]   it will vary for everybody.
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.780]   I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.740]   When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.340]   what good sleep means to you,
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.000]   and please see the episodes on sleep
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.380]   if you want more about tools to sleep.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.660]   When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.300]   you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.460]   You need to be able to turn the stress response off.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.920]   If I have one wish,
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.440]   well, I have many wishes for this lifetime,
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.840]   but if I have one wish today
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.960]   that I hope will permeate and spread out there
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.620]   is this idea that we need from a young age,
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.100]   but even as adults and forever,
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.580]   we need to learn how to turn off our stress response.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.140]   Physiological sigh is one.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.880]   If we're going to activate our stress response
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.860]   intentionally by ice baths, cold showers,
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.940]   cyclic, hyperoxygenated breathing,
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.360]   AKA Tummo breathing or Wim Hof breathing,
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.020]   we also need to learn how to press the brake, okay?
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.060]   So let's think about the stress system.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.140]   It knows how to activate itself.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.500]   Now we're talking about
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   a way of deliberately activating your stress system
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.780]   in order to combat infection.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.940]   I do this from time to time.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.420]   I might feel a tickle in my throat
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.580]   or like I'm getting kind of run down.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.260]   I will do this kind of breathing, I do.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.460]   I will take 25 or 30 breaths, exhale, hold my breath.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.000]   25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold my breath
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.780]   for about 15 seconds.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.200]   25, 30 breaths again,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.260]   exhale, hold my breath for 25 or 30 seconds,
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.060]   then a big inhale and I hold my breath
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.320]   until I feel the impulse to breathe.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.360]   Again, I feel it safe for me.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.240]   I've run it by my doctor, so it's fine.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.760]   You should not do this unless it's right for you,
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.600]   but I do this.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.520]   Some people like the ice bath.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.340]   I rarely do the ice bath.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.560]   Some people like cold showers.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.060]   I like hot showers.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.180]   So I take hot showers, but I do this kind of breathing.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.220]   Again, they are all having more or less the same effect
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.060]   of increasing adrenaline
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:19.380]   which allows you to combat the infection
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.420]   because you're activating the immune response.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.460]   Okay, so now let's talk about medium-term stress.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.540]   Medium-term stress is going to be stress
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:31.540]   that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:33.380]   We might think of that as long-term stress.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.540]   There are times in life
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.220]   when we are just dealing with a lot.
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.940]   This particular quarter, I happen to be directing a course.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:40.900]   I'm doing the lab.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.080]   I'm doing this.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.020]   I enjoy all these things immensely,
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.600]   but I'm kind of near my threshold.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.460]   I'm near the point where any additional thing,
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.140]   like I couldn't log onto a website the other day
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.060]   and it felt like the most intense thing in the world
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.900]   at that moment and I kind of laughed at myself.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.240]   Fortunately, I caught it,
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.060]   but that typically wouldn't be my response
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.180]   under conditions where I wasn't pushed to threshold.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.860]   What is this medium-term stress?
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.220]   What is stress threshold?
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.740]   Well, a stress threshold is actually our ability
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:14.020]   to cognitively regulate what's going on in our body.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.180]   So we've all hear so much about
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.420]   we need to unify our mind and body.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.660]   We need to be at one with our mind and body.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.420]   Now I realize I'm kind of poking fun
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.620]   at some of the new agey language,
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.580]   but the reason I poke fun is not because
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.160]   I don't think it has value, but it has no specificity.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.000]   What does that mean?
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.940]   I mean, I think I'm always in my body.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.880]   I've never fortunately looked across the room
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.320]   and seen my arm over there or my leg over there.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.020]   I'm connected to my body.
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.060]   There actually is a syndrome
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.700]   where people feel disconnected from their limbs.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.500]   This is a real clinical condition.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.760]   These people actually will seek out amputation.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.060]   They will try and convince doctors
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.220]   to amputate certain portions of their body.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.640]   It's a really terrible thing for people to have
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.340]   and it relates to a change in central maps in the brain,
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.200]   believe it or not.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.520]   Most of us want to keep our limbs,
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.020]   whichever ones we happen to have.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.700]   And most of us feel one in mind and body,
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.220]   so much so that when stress hits,
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.940]   we feel it in our mind and body.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.860]   A lot of stress inoculation,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.760]   a lot of managing medium-term stress
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.640]   on the timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.780]   So we're not talking about years of stress.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:24.420]   A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.580]   It's about capacity.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.060]   And there are very simple tools,
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.060]   excellent tools that will allow us
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.180]   to modulate our capacity for stress.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.620]   And they look a lot like the tools I just described.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.740]   They involve placing oneself deliberately
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:44.520]   into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat,
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.340]   not to the extreme.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.300]   And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.420]   and normally we would panic,
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.200]   it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally,
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.620]   calming ourselves and being comfortable
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.500]   with that response in our body.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.140]   So unlike trying to unify the mind and body
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.420]   and make it all calm or make it all alert,
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.280]   this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.940]   And what would this look like?
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.060]   Well, this is something I actually do as a practice
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.960]   because I mentioned before,
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.320]   you can use physiological size.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.940]   In real time, you can use
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.140]   the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.340]   if you're feeling kind of run down.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.340]   And there's also a way in which you can use things
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.800]   like cold showers, or if you exercise
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.540]   and you bring your heart rate up very high,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.700]   you kind of go into that high intensity realm
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.980]   where your heart is beating a little bit harder
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.780]   than you're comfortable with.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.940]   And that you're just, you feel,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.380]   some people think it's lactic acid.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.020]   No one can agree on this, what the burn is,
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.420]   whether it's lactic acid or it's buildup of hydrogen
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.240]   or whatever.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.080]   I don't want to get into that,
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.180]   but we're all familiar with the intense feeling
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.700]   of your muscles kind of burning
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:56.140]   because you're working very hard physically.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:00.140]   The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.300]   while the body is very activated.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.260]   And what that tends to do,
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.740]   there's a limited amount of research on this,
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.820]   but what that tends to do is it tends to create a situation
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.420]   where what once felt like a lot feels manageable.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.500]   Okay, you've raised your stress threshold
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.220]   or your stress capacity.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.560]   One way that you can do this, and this is kind of fun,
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.940]   if it's approved by your physician
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.200]   and you're able to do this,
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.620]   you can bring your heart rate up.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.860]   You could do this through an ice bath if that's your thing
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.540]   or a cold shower or cyclic oxygenation breathing,
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:32.360]   or you could sprint or you could go hard on the bike,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.700]   whatever it is that brings your heart rate up.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.300]   And then what you want to do
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.660]   is you want to actually try and calm the mind
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.500]   while your body is in this heightened state of activation.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.420]   And the best way that I'm aware to do that,
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.540]   again, goes back to physiology, not psychology.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.100]   When we are stressed, our pupils dilate,
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.340]   the effect of that pupil dilation
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.740]   is to create tunnel vision.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.940]   It literally narrows our view of the visual world.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.140]   We no longer see in panorama.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.620]   And there's some other effects as well,
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.060]   but that's because the visual system
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.700]   through this cranial nerve system that I described before
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:10.080]   is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.900]   By deliberately dilating your gaze,
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.740]   meaning not moving your head and eyes around,
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:18.060]   but by deliberately going from tunnel vision
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.260]   to broader panoramic vision,
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.880]   literally seeing more of your environment all at once.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.660]   You don't have to do what I'm doing, which is not blinking.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.180]   You're welcome to blink.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.520]   But it means deliberately dilating your gaze
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.760]   so that you can see yourself in the environment you're in.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.680]   It creates a calming effect on the mind
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.280]   because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.100]   that's associated with alertness, AKA stress.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.900]   Now, this is very powerful.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.340]   If you're running, for instance,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.840]   and you're at max capacity or close to it,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.460]   or you're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.580]   on the bike, and you dilate your gaze,
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.240]   what you'll find is the mind can relax
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.400]   while the body is in full output.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.780]   And this relates to work that in various communities,
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.820]   people are working with this in the sports community,
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.380]   military communities, et cetera,
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.780]   but it's a form, not really of stress inoculation.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.300]   It's more about raising stress threshold
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.140]   so that the body is going to continue to be
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.240]   in a high alertness, high reactivity mode, high output,
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.000]   but the mind is calm.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.520]   And so this isn't about unifying mind and body.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.200]   This is actually about using body
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.040]   to bring up your level of activation,
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.580]   then dissociating,
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.880]   not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders,
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.960]   but dissociating the mental or emotional response
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.160]   from what's going on in your body.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.380]   And over time, so if you do this a couple of times,
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.960]   you don't have to do this every workout,
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.440]   but if you do this maybe once a week or so,
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.040]   you start being comfortable
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.940]   at these higher activation states.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.880]   What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.500]   now is manageable, it feels tolerable.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.540]   So that's for navigating medium term stress.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.920]   Now there are other tools as well,
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.900]   but we don't want to go over 90 minutes
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.720]   'cause 90 minutes is one ultradian cycle.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.920]   I always try and keep these podcasts to one ultradian cycle
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.080]   in case you haven't noticed.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.000]   So you can derive maximum benefit from them
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.780]   based on ultradian cycle principles of learning.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.600]   So I don't want to go into every little bit of this
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.980]   and I want to make sure we get to emotions,
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.360]   but I want to emphasize that these medium term stressors
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.680]   of, oh, it's been a hard month or hard week,
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.940]   or Stanford's on the quarter system,
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.240]   so 10 weeks or semester,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.400]   that becomes more manageable when we train ourselves
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.800]   to be calm of mind when our body is activated.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.840]   And if you haven't noticed,
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.480]   most of the tools I'm describing today
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.960]   are nothing like the sort of, okay, sit and do meditation.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.460]   I'm actively avoiding saying the words NSDR,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.460]   non-sleep deep rest.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.120]   I talked a lot about those tools
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.080]   during the months on sleep and neuroplasticity.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.000]   And of course, they are wonderful
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.560]   for replenishing your ability to lean into effort,
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.180]   to learn, to focus.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.100]   Please do try and check out NSDR protocol,
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.120]   see if they're right for you.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.000]   The margins for safety I think are enormous.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.140]   You're basically just listening to a script.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.240]   We have links to them in previous captions.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.780]   I've talked to them on various podcasts before.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.280]   We can provide them again.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.320]   But today I'm really talking about tools
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.800]   so that you can learn to dance with stress,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.400]   to in the short term, reduce that stress response
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.240]   a little bit if you feel it's too uncomfortable.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.120]   In the medium term, to be comfortable
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.420]   at these heightened levels of activation
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.920]   because life is going to continue to come at you.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.260]   We can't pick the stressors,
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.400]   but we need to be able to function
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.700]   at a higher capacity often.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.640]   And then there's long-term stress.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.700]   Now, long-term stress is bad.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.360]   You do not want adrenaline up in your system
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.720]   for a very long time.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.240]   In fact, ideally you would have your stress go up
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.920]   various times throughout the day,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.720]   but it would never stay elevated
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.640]   and it would never prevent you
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.880]   from getting a good night's sleep.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.760]   Now that isn't realistic, okay?
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.280]   I would say for me, three, four nights out of the month,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.560]   no matter what I do, I take on too much
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.780]   or something happens and life is life
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.820]   and I don't get the best night's sleep
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.240]   that I would like to get.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.840]   For many of you, it's 30 nights per month.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.880]   For some of you, it's zero nights per month.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.160]   And congratulations to you zero nights per month people.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.360]   If you are managing your sleep really well every night,
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.120]   that is fantastic.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.960]   You really want to be able to fall asleep at night,
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.200]   stay asleep for most of the night.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.560]   And if you get up, go back to sleep
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.400]   for as long as you need to in order to feel rested.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.600]   That's what I define as a healthy relationship to sleep.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.020]   Check out the episodes on sleep
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.200]   if you want tools to be able to accomplish that.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.360]   We can all accomplish that.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.600]   It can be done.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.200]   And there are tools to do it, zero cost tools.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.460]   Okay, so let's talk about long-term stress.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:40.460]   Earlier I talked about how breathing can modulate heart rate
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.740]   through this loop that includes the brain
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.920]   and the parasympathetic nervous system.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.000]   I don't think I mentioned this
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.660]   and I want to make sure that I mentioned
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.240]   that breathing controlling heart rate
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.840]   through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.040]   is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.160]   And we know that heart rate variability is good.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   You don't want your heart rate chronically elevated
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.840]   or chronically low.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.680]   A lot of people think,
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.980]   "Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate."
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.600]   And indeed, if you're in shape,
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.200]   the stroke volume of your heart will be greater
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.800]   and you can have a nice slow heart rate.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.640]   Years ago when I was running regularly,
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.860]   I think my heart rate was down to like 50 or 60
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.700]   or something like that.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.000]   That's great, but, and now it's higher than that
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.300]   because I'm running a little bit less,
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.700]   but everyone needs to determine what's right for them.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.440]   But you don't really want your heart rate
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.960]   to be chronically low or chronically high.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.800]   Both are bad.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.880]   We know that chronic stress, elevated stress,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.520]   and especially in the so-called type A personalities
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.080]   creates heart disease.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.240]   Leading killer for in most every country,
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.880]   but in particular in the US.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.240]   Because of the way that adrenaline
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.560]   impacts those blood vessels of constricting
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.160]   and some and dilating others,
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.200]   it's just that kind of hypertension,
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.360]   chronic hypertension is just bad.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.760]   And so chronic stress truly is bad.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.600]   I wanna really make that clear
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.720]   because I emphasized a lot of what
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.440]   some of the positive effects of stress,
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.800]   but you want to be able to tamp down your stress
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.020]   in real time.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.200]   You also wanna be able to modulate your stress
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.840]   and your emotional relationship to stress in the body
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.180]   in the medium term,
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.060]   but by no means do you want to be stressed out all the time,
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.060]   chronically for months and months and months
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.200]   and years on end.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.080]   The best tools, the best mechanisms that we know
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.040]   to modulate long-term stress
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.640]   might surprise you a little bit.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.600]   First of all,
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.200]   there are gonna be the things that don't surprise you,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.600]   which is everyone knows getting regular exercise,
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.520]   getting good sleep,
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.720]   using real-time tools to try and tamp down
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.260]   the stress response, et cetera.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.080]   That's all gonna be really useful.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:56.040]   The data really point to the fact that social connection
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.280]   and certain types of social connection in particular
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.120]   are what are going to mitigate or reduce long-term stress.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.920]   And this is a particularly important issue nowadays
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.280]   where we have all these proxies or surrogates
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.840]   for social connection.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.080]   We're online and texting with people a lot
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.480]   so we can feel connected.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.180]   People are like the plane's about to take off
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.160]   and everyone's texting each other,
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.740]   whether or not they have fear of flying or not,
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.240]   they're like, okay, see you, love you, hate you,
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.920]   whatever it is that they're trying to communicate to people.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.800]   Then, you know, plane lands,
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.760]   everyone phones out, see you, love you, hate you.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.440]   Let's hope it's fewer hate yous.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.380]   But everyone has this kind of need
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.720]   to stay connected to one another.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.360]   Humans are incredibly social creatures.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.620]   Now, there is a way to look at this whole business
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.960]   of social connection,
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.880]   not from just the kind of wishy-washy, new agey perspective.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.240]   And I wanna point out that sometimes
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.080]   I'll say wishy-washy, new agey.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.680]   I have nothing against that.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.560]   My goal here is always to put scientific data
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.160]   and some neurochemistry on things
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.560]   so that for those of you that are into
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.920]   wishy-washy, new agey stuff,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.440]   you also can arm yourself with some arguments
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.960]   for the members of your family and your life
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.840]   that maybe aren't so tuned into the typical language
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.960]   around those practices.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.840]   Like, oh, connection is really key.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.040]   We all get oxytocin.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.000]   Actually, did you know that connection between individuals
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.320]   rarely causes the release of oxytocin?
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.380]   Oxytocin is released in very particular circumstances
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:28.380]   like post-orgasm, baby and mother, milk let down.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.660]   It's associated with kind of really intense
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.180]   kinds of pair bonding things of mother and child,
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.280]   also father and child, but especially mother and child
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.620]   because it's relationship to the lactation system.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.780]   Couples post sex, these kinds of things
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.940]   that were reflect deep kind of layers of our biology.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:49.380]   And oxytocin is not just released
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.280]   when we walk in and pat the dog on the head
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.840]   or we see somebody and we give them a hug
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.280]   and hey, great to see you, fist bump.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.900]   That's not a situation for oxytocin.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.520]   The way to think about social connection
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.540]   and how it can mitigate
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.740]   some of the long-term effects of stress
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.900]   is really through the systems of neuromodulation
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   like serotonin and through blocking certain things
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.600]   that are really bad for us when we feel socially isolated,
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.780]   things like tachykinins.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   So let me explain what these are.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.020]   Serotonin again is a neuromodulator.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.820]   Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists in the brain.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.460]   They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.320]   that certain brain circuits and body circuits
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.700]   are going to be activated and that others will not.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.340]   Serotonin generally,
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.060]   and I realize I'm speaking very generally here,
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.120]   but it generally gives us feelings of wellbeing
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.020]   at very high levels.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.020]   It makes us feel blissed and it tends to make us feel
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.640]   like we have enough in our immediate environment.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.420]   This is why some of the side effects of antidepressants
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.820]   that elevate serotonin and actually can help a lot of people
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.240]   with depressive symptoms.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.220]   But the side effects associated with drugs
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.700]   that increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.080]   They tend to kind of blunt affect
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.020]   or make people feel like their libido is lower.
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.980]   Desire goes down because the body has so much serotonin
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.140]   and the brain has so much serotonin
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.300]   that one feels like they have enough.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:13.300]   But serotonin, pharmacology aside,
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:18.100]   or taking antidepressants aside topic for another time,
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.040]   serotonin tends to make us feel good.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.380]   When we see somebody that we recognize and trust,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.240]   serotonin is released in the brain.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.140]   And that has certain positive effects on the immune system
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.860]   and on other systems of neural repair and synapses
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.460]   and things that really reinforce connections in the brain
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.380]   and prevent that long-term withering of connections.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.600]   So serotonin is tied to social connection.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.620]   Now, social connection can take many forms.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.580]   As many of you know, I am very attached to my dog.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.280]   I hope he's attached to me.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.180]   He's asleep most of the time, so I don't know.
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.320]   And even if he was awake,
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.560]   I don't really know what I would ask him,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.940]   but he seems more or less to be attached to me as well.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.180]   And there's no scientific evidence
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.700]   that it has to be human-human attachment.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.980]   I do have attachments to humans as well,
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.200]   but you can have attachments to other people.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.120]   Some of those can be romantic attachments.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.040]   Those could be familial attachments
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.560]   that are non-romantic, friendship, pets,
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.780]   even attachments to things that just delight us.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.180]   One of the things that really can mitigate
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.820]   against the long-term negative effects
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.620]   of chronic long-term stress isn't just having fun.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.180]   We hear all this stuff, you need to play and have fun.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.820]   That can be a little bit of a tough concept,
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.260]   especially for the hard driving people
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.780]   or people that are stressed, but having a sense of delight,
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.720]   a sense of really enjoying something that you see
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.840]   and engage in, witness or participate in,
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.100]   that is associated with the serotonin system.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.980]   And certainly play is one of those things,
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.480]   social connection of various forms.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.180]   Those are things to invest in.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.320]   Some people might say, well, nobody wants to be my friend
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.460]   or nobody wants to engage socially anymore.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.020]   I'll be the first to admit social connection and friendship
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.760]   and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.780]   or inanimate objects takes work.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   It takes investment.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.080]   It takes time in not needing everything
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.020]   to be exactly the way you want it to be.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.620]   I have a friend who struggles with this
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.640]   and oftentimes the conversations just circle back
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.280]   to the fact that when you want social connection,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.360]   you often have to be more flexible.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.920]   You have to eat on other people's schedules.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.880]   Sometimes you have to eat things
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.120]   you don't necessarily want to eat the most in that moment
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.440]   or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.560]   Social connection is something that we work for,
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.060]   but it is incredibly powerful.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:37.960]   I want to of course tip my hat to, it's only appropriate
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.160]   to call him the great Robert Sapolsky, my colleague
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.040]   who I'm fortunate to know at Stanford,
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.640]   of course has talked about this quite a lot.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.700]   So I want to acknowledge Robert's incredible work
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.920]   and discussions around this.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.640]   You can look up those materials online
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.120]   and his wonderful books.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.360]   But primates, and we are primates, we are social species.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.780]   And as Robert has said many times before,
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.800]   never before in any primate history,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.220]   but in particular in human history,
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.300]   have we interacted with so many strangers at a distance
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.680]   when we are not really connected to them.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.960]   So finding just a few people, even one or an animal
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.120]   or something that you delight in, believe it or not,
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.780]   has very positive effects on mitigating
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.080]   this long-term stress, on improving various aspects
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.880]   of our life as it relates to stress and emotionality.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.460]   So that's the social connection part.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.880]   The other thing is that social isolation
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.700]   that goes too long is associated in everything from flies,
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.520]   believe it or not, to mice and humans
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.520]   with this molecule, tachykinin.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.360]   Tachykinin is a molecule that makes us more fearful,
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.200]   paranoid, and impairs our immune system.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.860]   And so tachykinin is like this internal punishment signal.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.940]   It's like our body and our brain telling us
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.720]   you're not spending enough time with people
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.580]   that you really trust.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.480]   You're not spending time doing things that you really enjoy.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.760]   And I often think about tachykinin for myself
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.000]   because I'm pretty hard driving.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.880]   I have a lot of pursuits.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.720]   I also have a lot of wonderful people
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.900]   and an incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.600]   But there are times when I can be so goal-directed
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.440]   and so in motion and trying to accomplish everything
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.200]   that I sometimes forget about tachykinin.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.600]   And I like to remind myself so much
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.840]   so that I actually have a little post-it above my desk
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.780]   that says tachykinin to remind me
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.160]   that tachykinin is this very sinister molecule
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.900]   that starts being secreted
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.120]   when we are not socially connected enough.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.520]   And this is why long meals with friends or family
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.480]   where they're, we'll talk about phones in a moment,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.060]   but where there's no intrusions, or even if there are,
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:43.000]   just feeling like we are connected suppresses tachykinin.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.900]   And tachykinin is something you really want to avoid
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.560]   because chronic isolation, chronically high tachykinin
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.360]   that's associated with long-term stress
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:56.160]   really depletes so many good functions of our brain and body
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.280]   and promote so many bad ones, including irritability,
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.660]   paranoia, fear, et cetera,
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.400]   that is really something to avoid.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.120]   And so I want to highlight tachykinin
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.300]   as something to avoid.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:09.420]   I don't want to completely disregard oxytocin.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:12.160]   It's just that oxytocin has been built up a lot in the media
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.560]   and really serotonin works on much faster timescales.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.360]   Now, how do you know if you're making serotonin?
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.920]   And you don't know in the moment,
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.020]   but you can learn if you pay attention
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.800]   to kind of recognize these feelings of comfort,
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.460]   trust, bliss, delight, and those are not weak terms.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.200]   Those are not associated just with psychological terms.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.740]   They are every bit as physiological
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.300]   as the movement of your muscles
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.060]   or the secretion of adrenaline.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.400]   And many people focus now on gratitude.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.320]   Gratitude is a little bit subjective
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.360]   and here we're moving from some objective
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.500]   to kind of subjective things,
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.740]   but recognizing and in particular writing down
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.500]   things that you're thankful for,
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.900]   however small they may seem,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.760]   does seem to have a positive effect on the serotonin system.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.280]   Now, there are a plethora of things
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.880]   that will also impact wellbeing
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.920]   and allow you to modulate your long-term stress,
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.840]   reduce the likelihood that you'll engage in long-term stress
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.200]   and we don't have time to go into all of these,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.120]   but of course, finding the diet and nutrition
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.700]   that's right for you, the exercise schedule
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.220]   that's right for you, the sleep schedule, all that,
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:20.140]   but do not underemphasize the social connection part, please.
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:23.200]   As well, there are some compounds
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.320]   that are not antidepressants,
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.940]   although if you need antidepressants
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.560]   and a clinician prescribes them to you,
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.260]   please follow their advice if that's what's right for you.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.440]   There are compounds that are not prescription compounds
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.200]   that can modulate the stress system.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.600]   And sometimes because of the way that life is,
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.760]   we just don't have the opportunity to control life
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.800]   and to control our response to stress.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.220]   And at least for myself,
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.920]   I can only talk about my own experience.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.700]   I've found it useful in times of chronic stress
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.920]   to start modulating some of the neurochemistry
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.040]   related to the stress response in order to help.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.700]   Now, if a doctor prescribes you Pregnisone
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:03.340]   or prescribes you some other hormone or something,
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.180]   that's important.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.480]   But what I'm talking about now are non-prescription things.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.280]   You should check out examine.com, this free website,
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.400]   which will allow you to put in any supplement
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.040]   and evaluate that supplement.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.820]   They provide links in the so-called human effect matrix
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.900]   to PubMed.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.180]   It tells you the exact subjects they were done in.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.420]   It was a post-menopausal women.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.460]   Was it kids?
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.540]   Was it normal adults?
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.280]   Was it people with autism, et cetera?
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.480]   Check out that site for any and all supplements
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.760]   you're considering or taking.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.000]   I highly recommend it.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.680]   I have no relationship to them.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.000]   I just think it's a wonderful site
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.460]   that's curated all this important information.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:41.320]   But some of these compounds are effective enough.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.240]   They can kind of take the edge off
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.040]   and I will use them periodically myself.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.280]   And so I just thought I'd mention them
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.740]   since there are a number of you that are interested in them.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:49.960]   The three I want to focus on
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.560]   and one that I think you need to be cautious about
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.220]   that I've mentioned before include ashwagandha.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.900]   Funny name, but that's what it's called.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.300]   L-theanine or theanine it's often called and melatonin.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.700]   Let's talk about melatonin first.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.880]   Melatonin I talked about during the month on sleep.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.060]   Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.740]   in direct relationship to how much darkness you are in,
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:16.420]   not emotional darkness, but light suppresses melatonin.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.820]   Melatonin helps you fall asleep.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.180]   It doesn't help you stay asleep.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.720]   I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.320]   because it's supplemented typically at very high levels,
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.440]   one to three milligrams or even more.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.640]   That is an outrageously high dose.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.440]   It's super, super physiological
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.040]   compared to what you normally would make.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.200]   It also has a number of potentially negative effects
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.860]   on the reproductive axis and hormones there.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.400]   Some people can take it without problems.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.500]   If you like it and that's your thing, fine.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.480]   I just want to cue to the fact that there can be issues.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.880]   You should check on examine.com, talk to your doctor,
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.340]   especially in kids because melatonin suppresses
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.880]   the puberty response in a number of species.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.620]   Enough about the negative things of melatonin
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:01.480]   except that people who take too much melatonin chronically
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.760]   oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.900]   or for whatever reason,
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.440]   yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.240]   but it also can reduce the output of the adrenals
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.440]   to the point where it can become problematic.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.560]   Now, a note about adrenal burnout.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.340]   There is actually no such thing as adrenal burnout
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.680]   under normal conditions.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.740]   The adrenals have enough adrenaline
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.060]   to support 200 years of stress for better or for worse.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.360]   The concept of adrenal burnout has origins
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.680]   in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.240]   who actually discovered
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.100]   what he called the general adaptation syndrome.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.880]   He discovered a lot of things about stress.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.960]   He did some phenomenal work that turned out to be true,
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.060]   that we have stressors, there's something called distress.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.040]   He talked about eustress, which is positive stress.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.680]   Eustress has never really caught on
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.640]   in the kind of more general discussion,
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.300]   but he had this theory that if stress went on long enough
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.520]   that you would eventually reach a phase called exhaustion.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.440]   And that turned out to be wrong,
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.820]   although many of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress,
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.680]   there isn't really a physiological exhaustion that happens.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.720]   And that eventually got picked up
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.600]   and ran with the general public
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.120]   and they talk about adrenal burnout,
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.700]   too much coffee, adrenal burnout.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.680]   You hear all this stuff.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.240]   There is no such thing as adrenal burnout.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.080]   The adrenals don't burn out.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.140]   There is something, however,
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.160]   called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   which is a real physiological problem
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.120]   where some people have very impaired adrenals
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.440]   and they can't produce adrenaline.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.160]   And melatonin taken at very high levels
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.000]   for periods of time that are too long
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.020]   can cause suppression of the cortisol
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.600]   and epinephrine release from the adrenals
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.880]   and can create a kind of pseudo
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.480]   adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.640]   So beware melatonin for that reason.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.220]   Please, I'm trying,
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.880]   I alone can't get rid of the phrase adrenal burnout.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.260]   I'm not trying to give a hard time
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.600]   to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted,
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.140]   but it is for other reasons.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.240]   It is not because of the adrenals are burnt out
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.680]   unless you happen to have adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.640]   So I'm not a fan of melatonin for a lot of reasons.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.480]   Now I've mentioned several.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.540]   The other is L-theanine.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.200]   I've talked about L-theanine,
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.600]   which provided it's safe for you,
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.200]   can be taken 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   about a 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.140]   It can enhance the transition to sleep
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.880]   and depth of sleep for many people.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.360]   It increases GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.380]   In the brain it tends to turn off our forebrain a little bit
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.800]   or reduce the activity of our kind of thinking systems
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.620]   and ruminating systems help people fall asleep.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.560]   That's for sleep.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.800]   But theanine has also been shown
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.240]   for people that are chronically anxious
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.920]   or chronically stressed to,
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.280]   if you look at the studies,
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.480]   I have a large collection of studies
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.520]   in front of me right now.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.880]   If you want to see those links,
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.720]   I know if you want those,
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.920]   go to examine.com, put in theanine.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:47.920]   They linked, for instance,
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.360]   it is known to significantly increase relaxation.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.800]   There are four studies listed there with PubMed links.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.140]   It is known to have a minor effect on anxiety,
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.780]   but eight studies have shown that,
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.440]   which I think is a fairly large set of studies,
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.560]   some of them in great journals.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.920]   It also can reduce task completion anxiety.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.980]   So anxiety related to task completion,
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.720]   not good for the procrastinators perhaps,
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.440]   but for those of you that are chronically stressed,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.720]   it can increase attention a little bit,
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.440]   it can reduce blood pressure a little bit,
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.040]   improve sleep quality, et cetera.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.000]   It definitely has a notable effect on stress,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.240]   two studies in particular,
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.120]   that it can notably reduce the effects of stress.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.080]   So there's a lot there.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.960]   It also has effects on insomnia,
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.560]   on some blood lipid profiles.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.240]   And so go to examine.com and check it out.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.240]   But this is one reason why I supplement theanine for sleep.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.760]   But if I'm feeling like I've been under a lot of stress
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.740]   and I'm not managing my stress very well
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:42.140]   with the short-term and medium-term tools
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.120]   that I talked about earlier,
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.880]   I might start taking a little bit of theanine,
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.120]   especially in the late afternoon,
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.660]   which is when I tend to start to feel like
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.140]   I haven't gotten enough done
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.000]   and the day is kind of carrying on.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.760]   And so you can blunt the response to stress a little bit,
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.780]   which is why a lot of companies
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.240]   are now putting theanine into energy drinks.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.620]   I'm not a big fan of most energy drinks.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.240]   Most of them have taurine,
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.620]   which I know some of you wrote to me and said,
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.680]   "Oh, taurine's great for all these reasons."
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.760]   Taurine also has effects on the microvasculature
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.120]   that at least for me were not good.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.880]   It caused bursting of microvasculature
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.800]   in my sclera, in my eyes,
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.180]   which is why I'm not a fan of any energy drink
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.300]   that has taurine or taurine generally.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:21.140]   But that's just me.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.160]   You have to decide for you.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.260]   I'm sure the comment section,
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.680]   there'll be a couple taurinistas out there that will say,
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.520]   "But I love taurine."
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.060]   Great, keep the taurine companies in business,
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.200]   but it's not for me.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.400]   And I'd like people to know
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.940]   that it may or may not be for them.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.340]   The other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.300]   Ashwagandha is known to lower anxiety and cortisol.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.640]   There is six, there are, excuse me,
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.600]   six studies that collectively show reductions in cortisol,
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.560]   which is cortisol is typically associated
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.360]   with waking up in the morning, which is good.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.160]   That's a healthy, brief cortisol bump that goes away
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.800]   provided you're getting your light at the right time of days
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.160]   at right correct times of day, like morning and evening.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.240]   But you don't want cortisol chronically elevated.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.400]   That's associated with all the bad stuff about stress.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:09.300]   There's a very strong effect of ashwagandha.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:12.080]   You can find dosages at examine.com.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.280]   They report across six studies,
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.660]   14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:22.460]   in otherwise healthy but stressed individuals.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.760]   Now, I don't know about kids.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.760]   You have to look at what it says on various supplements.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.760]   Most things here are being done in adults,
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.400]   so please check carefully, but this is great.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.460]   I mean, the opportunity for me anyway
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.360]   to be able to take something that can help me reduce
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.460]   my cortisol so that I don't get some
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.880]   of the long-term effects of stress,
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   and I'm not going to take ashwagandha year round.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.200]   I would only do this if I was feeling
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.320]   like I wasn't managing my short and medium term stress well.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.760]   So I don't take it on a regular basis.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.280]   I do take it when I'm in these times
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.660]   when things are particularly stressful.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.680]   It has, there are five other studies
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.440]   that show reduced stress,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.160]   so that's not cortisol measurements,
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.440]   but things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.620]   It does lower total cholesterol,
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.720]   which may or may not be good or bad for you, up to 10%.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.700]   So some people don't want their cholesterol lowered.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.100]   Some people might.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.060]   Cholesterol, we'll talk about this in a month on hormones,
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.740]   but cholesterol is the molecule
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.540]   from which testosterone and estrogen,
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.740]   and cortisol for that matter, are synthesized.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.740]   So you don't want to get your cholesterol so low
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.620]   then there are all sorts of negative effects,
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.820]   but you don't want it too high either.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.020]   Mild effects in good clinical studies
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.720]   on reducing depression probably associated
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.880]   with the effects on stress and some other things as well.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.060]   So ashwagandha is something I use from time to time.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.400]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.840]   L-theanine, I rarely will use those during the daytime
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.940]   except under conditions
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.440]   where I'm feeling chronically stressed.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.280]   So check out the Human Effect Matrix on examine.com.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   Again, a phenomenal website.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.820]   I think I've sent them a few emails before.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.900]   That's the only exchanges I've ever had with them,
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.940]   but I just think it's wonderful
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.320]   that they put together this resource.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.440]   Otherwise we'd be stuck mining PubMed.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.800]   They've collated the papers from PubMed
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.620]   with links to PubMed, so terrific resource.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.520]   So social connection and some supplementation,
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:14.040]   of course, diet, exercise, sleep for long-term stress.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.760]   And now we are finally in a position to talk
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.240]   about what we have set out to do from the beginning,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.180]   which is spend the month on emotions.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.080]   It was very important that we discuss stress
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.360]   and we discuss in the context of short, medium,
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.600]   and long-term stress,
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.900]   that we discuss tools for short-term, medium-term,
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:35.960]   and long-term control.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.040]   I don't really want to say mitigation of stress.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.060]   Stress is going to happen,
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.160]   but our ability to modulate and control stress
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.520]   in real time, offline, using tools such as respiration,
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.320]   using tools such as dilation of gaze,
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.880]   using tools like social connection, maybe some supplements.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.240]   Certainly take care of your sleep
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.180]   and nutrition and exercise.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.840]   Again, tons of resources and information
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.280]   in the sleep episodes.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.100]   So you can look there.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:05.140]   We will do a month on hormones, on exercise, et cetera.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.720]   But let's talk about emotions
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.840]   because in subsequent episodes,
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.640]   we're going to talk about OCD.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.000]   We're going to talk about depression.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.920]   We're going to talk about mania.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.640]   We're going to be talking about dopamine
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.520]   and all sorts of things.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.340]   But at the core of emotions is this question,
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.760]   what is an emotion?
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.920]   Well, it's complex.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.280]   There isn't a single brain area
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.000]   for any one of these things that we call emotions.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.740]   My framework, and I think the modern science,
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.740]   both psychology and neuroscience is pretty well aligned
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:41.560]   with what Lisa Feldman Barrett has talked about.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.200]   Now, Lisa's at Northeastern University.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.360]   She runs a big lab there.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.520]   She's a world expert in emotion.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   She's written two books that are really wonderful.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.360]   One is "How Emotions Are Made," which was her first book.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.560]   The second one is "Seven and a Half Facts About the Brain."
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.800]   It's a wonderful book as well.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.140]   It came out more recently.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.180]   I hosted Lisa on an Instagram Live once.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.440]   Maybe we'll get her here on the podcast if we're lucky.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.040]   We don't agree on everything
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.360]   about the neuroscience of emotions,
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.040]   but I subscribe to most everything that I've heard Lisa say,
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.120]   in particular, the fact that emotions are context dependent,
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.520]   there's a cultural dependence, et cetera.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.880]   I look at things mainly through the lens of physiology
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.080]   and neuroscience at kind of low-level circuitry.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.740]   And one way to think about emotions
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:27.160]   that I think is consistent,
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.880]   and I think Lisa would generally approve,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.700]   I can't speak for her,
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.020]   but I would hope she would generally approve
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.440]   of this description is that when our internal state
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.980]   of stress or calm matches the demands on us,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.260]   or is mismatched from the demands on us,
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:44.500]   we tend to interpret those as good or bad.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.280]   Let me give you an example.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   If I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside,
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.720]   and I have a lot to do, that doesn't feel good,
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.280]   but it's really no different than if I'm very tired
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.440]   and I have a lot to do because there's this mismatch.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.360]   I'm not in the right internal state.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.280]   My internal state isn't correct, rather,
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.820]   to meet the demands that are being placed upon me.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.900]   So in both cases, whether I'm too tired or I'm too stressed
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:14.320]   to do what I need to do, the valence,
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.300]   meaning the value that I assign to that is I don't feel good.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.880]   It's not a good situation and I don't feel good.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.040]   Now, I might call it stressed, I might call it anxious,
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.860]   I might call it worried,
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.720]   might call it a number of things, but it's not good.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.160]   However, when I'm tired and I want to fall asleep,
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.480]   well, then I feel good because that's what the demand is.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.080]   I need to go to sleep and I'm tired.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.600]   If I'm wide awake and I need to fall asleep,
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.640]   then that's not good.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.180]   And then the brain tends to go down the direction
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.520]   of interpreting the situation as a bad one.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.260]   So while the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.420]   and more elaborate than this,
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.780]   one way to think about your relationship to emotions
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.620]   is whether or not your internal state
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:57.520]   is matching the demands that are upon you.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.380]   So in that way, we don't really place so much value
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.800]   on whether or not we're feeling alert or sleepy.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.760]   We only place value on whether or not that alertness,
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.020]   whether or not it's full-blown stress or not,
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.500]   or our sleepiness, whether or not we're falling asleep
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.000]   or just a little bit drowsy,
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.560]   whether or not that matches the conditions that we face.
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.380]   And it's a useful framework to have.
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.000]   And it's the reason in part
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.920]   why I spent this last hour and a half or so
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.800]   talking about stress and how to control stress.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.700]   One reason we did that
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.500]   is because I think it's a valuable opportunity
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.640]   to learn some tools and understand stress
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.560]   and really learn how to take control of stress,
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.480]   which I think we could all benefit from doing,
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.960]   regardless of age.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.180]   The other reason is that when you start to understand
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.640]   that you have this kind of seesaw system in your body,
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.200]   this autonomic nervous system
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.780]   that takes you from alert and calm to stressed,
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.220]   to full-blown panic, it has that capacity,
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:53.220]   or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:57.300]   to God forbid, let's hope never, but a coma, right?
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.600]   That you're basically on this seesaw all the time
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.840]   and where you are on that seesaw of alertness or calmness
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:08.340]   positions you to be in better reaction
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.740]   to the demands that you face,
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.200]   whether or not the thing that you face
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.200]   is a need to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.920]   You now know, for instance,
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.840]   that if your job is to take feedback,
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.640]   when maybe you're going in for a job evaluation
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.400]   or you're in a relationship
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.300]   where there was a call for a discussion
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.240]   and somebody needs to talk to you about something
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.500]   and we need to talk about something,
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.340]   you're going to them like,
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.040]   "Oh goodness, this is going to be rough."
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.280]   Learning to reduce that stress response a little bit
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.940]   so that you are in a position to hear the information better.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.380]   And remember from a previous episode,
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.220]   if you close your eyes,
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:44.800]   you'll be able to actually focus on the information better.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.700]   There's your permission to not look someone directly
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.620]   in the eye while they talk to you
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.900]   if you really want to hear what they have to say.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.340]   You will be able to modulate that stress response
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.060]   and lean into life better.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:59.020]   You will be able to react to things in a more effective way
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.980]   and to not be reactive.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:04.800]   And this is really one of the important things to me anyway,
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.700]   is that so much of the language around psychology,
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.360]   which I think is a wonderful field,
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.340]   but pop psychology in particular is,
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.180]   be responsive, not reactive.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.100]   Well, great, but then how does one do that?
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.540]   Well, one does that by modulating
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.120]   their short-term stress response in real time,
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.300]   not by saying, hold on, I need to meditate,
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:22.540]   hold on, I need a massage
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.700]   and then I can have this conversation
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:27.020]   by modulating the reactivity in real time.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:30.380]   How does one, for instance, be mindful,
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.980]   which is a beautiful concept, but how are you mindful?
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.900]   Well, I don't know, when I'm moving through my day,
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.360]   a lot of times I'm just trying to get things done.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.900]   And as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I'm doing
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.040]   and kind of third-personing what I'm doing,
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.740]   it actually takes me out of the effectiveness
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.820]   and experience of what I'm doing.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.860]   So for me, sometimes that mindfulness,
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.440]   that observer as they call it,
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.200]   is something that doesn't help me, it actually hinders me.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.560]   What's important to me is to be able to work and focus
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.540]   and then to be able to disengage,
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.580]   to be able to do a non-sleep deep rest
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.940]   or to be able to still fall asleep,
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:02.400]   even though I've been working hard until 9.30
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.760]   to put my head down at 10 o'clock
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.040]   and be out cold sleeping by 10.02.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.580]   That's possible if you can learn
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.000]   to control this stress response.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   And to do that, we can't use the mind to control the mind,
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.060]   we need tools.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.600]   And so a lot of the people being grumpy
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.160]   or anxious or depressed, a lot of that,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.780]   provided it's not for some underlying neurochemical reason
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.420]   that's chronic, a lot of that comes from being
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.860]   poorly rested, from overworked,
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.140]   from feeling like the world is bearing down on us.
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.600]   And so rather than take a subjective view of this,
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.080]   I take the view of objective physiology.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.520]   What can we do that's anchored to these neuronal systems
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.420]   in our body, in our brain, in our eyes,
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:47.380]   in our diaphragm, et cetera, and look to those as tools,
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:49.400]   levers that we can pull on and push
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.200]   and maneuver through life in a way
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.060]   where we start to feel like we have some agency,
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.400]   we actually have some real control
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.980]   because we're controlling the internal landscape.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.600]   So I think that ought to set the stage
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.800]   for where we're headed next, which is to talk about
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.500]   all the things that you normally think of
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.000]   when you think of emotions, like happiness,
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   like awe, like joy, and we will get into some of that.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.100]   But all of that rests firmly on the foundation
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:15.260]   of this thing we call the autonomic nervous system,
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:19.540]   this stress modulation, this calming modulation system.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.440]   And again, whether or not you're activated
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.700]   or you're calm is not good or bad,
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.820]   it depends on the situation.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.080]   Certainly when you want to fall asleep,
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.220]   being activated isn't good.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:30.820]   When you have work to do, being activated is great.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:34.240]   So I hope today you were able to take
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.780]   a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress,
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.700]   not just see it as evil, but see it as powerful and useful
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.740]   in certain contexts, great for us in certain contexts,
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.860]   and problematic in other contexts,
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.900]   and as well to think about the various tools
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.280]   that I've presented that can allow you to adjust
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.020]   and modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:57.420]   so that you can lean more effectively into life,
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:00.060]   which includes sleep and social connection
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.800]   and the work you have to do.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.380]   And of course acknowledges that the events in the world
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:06.820]   are beyond our control.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.900]   What's in our control is how we react to them.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.180]   Something that's commonly said in the wellness
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.760]   and self-help and psychology world,
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.040]   but for which there often aren't as many concrete tools
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.100]   that we can really look to and trust in real time.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.900]   And of course there are other tools out there.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:25.780]   As always, I'll say it, I strive to be accurate,
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:27.420]   but I'll never be exhaustive.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.820]   I might have exhausted you.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:32.300]   I might've cured your insomnia with this discussion today,
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:33.540]   but in all seriousness,
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.940]   my goal is to bring you tools and information
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.580]   so that you can manage better through life.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:40.260]   So thanks so much.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.820]   I very much want to thank all of you
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.820]   for your support for the podcast.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.740]   It's really been wonderful.
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.480]   If you've subscribed to the podcast on YouTube,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.280]   Apple or Spotify, or maybe even all three, terrific.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.140]   If you haven't, please do subscribe on YouTube,
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.440]   Apple or Spotify, or maybe even all three,
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.020]   which would be wonderful.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.540]   On Apple, you can leave a five-star review
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:01.820]   if you think we deserve that,
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.980]   as well as a comment reviewing us.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.580]   If you have suggestions,
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:10.140]   if you have questions regarding the content of the podcast
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.820]   or things that you'd like us to cover in the future,
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:15.540]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:19.020]   As well, if you could recommend the podcast to friends,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.340]   family members, coworkers
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.140]   that you think would benefit from the information,
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:24.600]   maybe even send them the links if you like,
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.700]   that's tremendously helpful.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.820]   Today, as in previous episodes,
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:30.360]   I've touched on some things
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.180]   as they relate to supplementation.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.040]   As always, I always cover a lot of tools
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.780]   that are zero cost tools
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.180]   that don't involve ingesting anything at all,
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.700]   behavioral tools.
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.340]   But I mentioned some supplements
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.100]   that I particularly find useful.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:46.880]   With supplements, it's a complicated landscape often
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.300]   because many supplement companies don't put in the bottle
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:54.620]   what they say is in the particular product.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.320]   We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.660]   because Thorne is a supplement company
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.140]   that we know to have the highest levels of stringency.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:05.020]   It's used by the Mayo Clinic.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.340]   It's used by all the major sports organizations
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.460]   for that particular reason
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:11.340]   and because their quality standards are exceptionally high.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:13.420]   If you'd like to try any supplements
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.620]   and see the ones that I take,
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.620]   you can go to thorne.com/theletteru.
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:23.620]   And if you do that, you'll get 20% off
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:27.980]   anything that's listed there on my page,
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.220]   as well as any of the supplements that Thorne sells.
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.220]   So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/theletteru/huberman
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:40.520]   to get 20% off anything that Thorne sells.

[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.540]   I also do some content on Huberman Lab,
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.580]   little neuroscience posts.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.520]   Some are reposted clips from the podcast.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.640]   Others are unique content
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.420]   that you won't find on the podcast.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.540]   So you can follow us at Huberman Lab.

[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.240]   really appreciate your time and attention today.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.140]   I hope you practice some of the tools
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.040]   if they're right for you.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.100]   I hope you think hard about stress
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.940]   and how you can control your stress.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:17.700]   And above all, as always,
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:19.500]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.660]   (upbeat music)
