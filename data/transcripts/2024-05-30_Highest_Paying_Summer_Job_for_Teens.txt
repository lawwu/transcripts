[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Who's your Realtor?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Seriously, who is your Realtor?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Lately, there's been a lot in the news about real estate and Realtors.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So let us help clear the air.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   California Realtors are Californians just like you,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   your neighbor, your best friend's brother,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and your kid's baseball coach.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And we all strive every day to be your trusted advisors
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   on the biggest financial decision of your life.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   No one cares more about helping Californians live the California Dream
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   than California Realtors.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Because we know California real estate is not easy.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   That's an understatement.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But if you're a first-timer, we help you confidently get in the game.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And if you've been there, done that,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   we're there to help you get through what's new and different.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We tirelessly negotiate so you don't have to.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And we help you get past all the tough stuff and on to the good stuff.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Not because it's our job, but because it's your dream.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let's go to work.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   California Association of Realtors.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Today on the podcast, I would like to give some advice to teenagers
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and parents of teenagers related to a summer job.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And in today's podcast, I am going to tell you
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   what I believe is the highest-paying summer job
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   that is available for teens.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This summer job will make you far more than minimum wage.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It could pretty easily make you 10x minimum wage.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It possibly could make you as much as a few hundred dollars per hour.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And I am not exaggerating.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   That job, very simply, is to apply for scholarships,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   especially college scholarships.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Some months back, a friend of mine who has many teenagers
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   wrote to me and said, "Joshua, how can I teach my teens to make money?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   What's the best way for my teens to make money?"
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And I've been thinking about this for quite a long time.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And obviously, there are many things that a teenager can do to make money.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And in fact, I'm very grateful that there are more things today
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   that a teenager can do to make money
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   more than ever before in human history.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Now, this particular friend of mine lives in Europe,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and there's not a place where, in the town where she lives,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   it's unlikely that her children will be able to get
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   kind of the standard American-style summer job.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But that doesn't mean that there aren't employment opportunities.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   There's always opportunities for a job.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But I think, don't we want a little bit more?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Wouldn't we like to make a little bit more money?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And so you go to things like self-employment or business.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Well, one of the nice things about the Internet Revolution
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   is that if a teenager is able to develop the skills
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   that the market values, then that teenager can access
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   a global job market.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And because of being able to be hidden behind a computer screen,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   oftentimes the teenager can surpass the standard built-in age discrimination
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   that teens face in the workplace and earn good money.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   However, as I've thought about that--
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   and by the way, I'll talk more about that in the future--
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   as I've thought about that, I've always been struck by this balance.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And the balance is simply how many teens
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   are actually going to be able to do that stuff.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We celebrate enormously successful teen entrepreneurs, rightly,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   because it's very unusual.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And while all of us think that, of course,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   our children are absolutely number one,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   we have to acknowledge the fact that, many times,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   teens don't have these skills, and it's difficult to develop them.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's not to say that we shouldn't be giving them good coaching
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   to help and develop those skills,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   but all of the alternative radical ideas related to making money as a teenager
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   require some pretty ambitious teens and pretty ambitious parents.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Now, it's my aspiration to raise such ambitious teens,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and I hope that you also have that ambition.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   But as I've thought about it, I think there is a simpler path.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And the path doesn't sound very radical when I talk about it,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   because guess what it is?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Do well in school, go to college, get advanced degrees if possible,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and get great jobs that start great careers.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It doesn't sound all that unique,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   because, after all, that's the standard advice.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But just because it's the standard advice doesn't mean that it's wrong.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   In fact, in this case, I think it is good advice.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I've pondered this for years.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I've pondered how much do we encourage entrepreneurial endeavors,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   how much do we do that as compared to academics.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I'm pretty well persuaded that academics should be the primary job
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   for most of our young people.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Students who are skilled with academics should focus intensively on those academics,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and they should focus as intensively as possible on mastering that system.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Teens should focus on getting straight A's.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Teens should develop study skills so that they can do well in class
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and get top grades without actually working all that hard.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   They should put hours and hours and hours into preparation for important exams,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   such as PSAT and SAT and ACT and AP exams and CLEP exams and A-levels
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and the Abitur and all of the various baccalaureate, the baccirato,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   all the European things as well, if you're a European listener.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You should do all of them.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And those are really, really important.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Those are really, really important for you to focus your time and your attention on.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That system is not broken.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   That system is working very, very well today.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Students who are capable of high academics and who are motivated for high academics
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   should be focusing on that system.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And I do not think that from a purely financial perspective,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I do not think that there is any after-school job that is going to be superior
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   in high school to doing well in academics.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now, I'm going to focus today's podcast on the topic of scholarships,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   but I'd like to talk for a few hours about all the things that you can add to that,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   all the things you can do in high school, all of the internships you can take,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   all of the unpaid work, all of the volunteering,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and how even that stuff really pays off.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   My point here is just to say that that system works really, really well.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And I fear that in the current strong swing against college,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I fear that we've swung very far the other way.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And I fear that we're going to spend more time telling students,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "You've got to focus on building a business,"
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   instead of helping them to succeed within the academic environment and context.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Here's how I see it pretty simply.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   If you are capable of getting good grades or if you're capable of doing well on exams,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   either by dint of your natural intellectual ability or your absolute work ethic,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   that should be your primary focus.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That should be your major area of focus.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Do entrepreneurship if you're interested, but don't think that that's a magic path to wealth.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It may work out well, and you can always do entrepreneurship,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and you can do entrepreneurship alongside your academics.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It's valuable, but don't neglect focus on academics.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Why don't people see the value of focusing on academics?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   One big reason, which is what I'm focusing on today,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is that they think the payoff is many, many years in the future.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They think that the payoff is, "Well, after I finish high school and after I go to college
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and after I pay $150,000 for a college degree,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   then I'll finally start to make some money,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and maybe I can have my student loans paid off by the time I'm 30."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Well, this is nonsense.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   This is ignorant nonsense.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Your focus on academics can pay off very, very quickly,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   possibly in as few as two or three or four years, depending on your age,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   if you know what you're doing and you're paying attention to life.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Now, unfortunately, most of us, when we are teens, we are ignorant.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I was ignorant, totally ignorant in high school, totally ignorant in college.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I never even imagined that there were people out there who could give me good advice.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I have a friend of mine who is a professional guidance counselor
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   at an elite international private school,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and his entire career is helping the children of elite parents
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   to go and fulfill their dreams and be placed into a college environment
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   that is a good fit for them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Not a single time in high school did I meet with my guidance counselor.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I knew the guy's name, but I never had a clue.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   No one explained to me what a guidance counselor was,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   what a guidance counselor did.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I didn't even imagine that there were resources out there that could help me.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I didn't have a clue.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   When I went to college, I didn't engage in any strategic planning.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I took an SAT exam.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I never studied for an SAT exam.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I just took it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I got a score.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I assumed that that was the point of the test.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I didn't know you could study for the SAT exam.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I didn't know you could take prep classes.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I didn't know you could take prep books.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   No one sat me down and explained to me how crucial this number was.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I never had a clue.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I just went, took the exam, got a score, figured, "All right, now that's done."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I never took the ACT.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I never tried for much of anything else.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I took a few AP exams because I thought it would be fun,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   but no one coached me on actually preparing for the AP exams.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I didn't know how to study.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I just kind of naturally did okay and passed most of them
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and failed a few of them and kind of went on with my life.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   When I went to college, I applied to exactly one college,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and I applied for exactly one extra scholarship
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   simply because my siblings had all gotten the scholarship.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I didn't know you could go and apply for many scholarships,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   so I got a little bit of merit-based aid from my university.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I got a Florida Bright Futures scholarship based upon my GPA,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and I got a Kiwanis scholarship because all of my siblings
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   had all gotten a Kiwanis scholarship, and so I knew to apply for that.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I never even dreamed that I could go and apply for more scholarships,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and so I trotted off to school, and with the owed money,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   started borrowing money on student loans,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and I just assumed that was the way it was.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I was entirely ignorant of all of the world of money
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that could be thrown at me if I just exercised a little bit of attention
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and a little bit of initiative, and I desperately wish
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I had figured it out that I'd gotten coaching.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I don't blame anybody. I don't blame anybody but myself,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   but I was too dumb to go and ask questions.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So what I want to explain to you, either the teen or aspiring teen
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   or parent of a teen today, is how wrong that thinking is,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and I want to tell you why studying for school, taking exams,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   doing exam prep, applying for scholarships
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   is probably the best-paying work that you can possibly do.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Now, let me defend quickly the point I made about
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   you don't have to wait for many years.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Here's the math of college. When people look at college,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   especially today in which it has now become very popular
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   to gripe about college and to say it's not worth it,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   the whole system is broken, it's not worth it,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and it's too expensive, what if college were free?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   What if college were entirely free?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Even better, what if you got paid to go to college?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Would that change the math? Would that change the calculus?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And here I mean calculus in the sense that
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   your own calculations of cost versus value.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   This is the missing point that people do not understand
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   when it comes to college.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I would be very slow to encourage someone to go to college
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   if the cost of college was to go out and spend $150,000
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and borrow it on student loans to go and get a mediocre degree
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   from a mediocre college.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   In that specific circumstance, I'm going to be on
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   the anti-college bandwagon for that student.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Instead of that, I'm going to go and encourage the student
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   to go and get a quick, fast, and easy degree online
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   so you can just check the box that I've got a college degree,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   and I'm going to focus on getting into a career,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   getting into work, and just getting the degree fast, easy, and cheap.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm not going to go deep into college financing,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   but the idea that college today is expensive is absurd.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   College is only expensive at universities that publish
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   their rates as expensive private universities,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and it's only expensive if you don't get any financial aid.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And yet, in the way the U.S. system works,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   they throw financial aid money at you if you're intelligent
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and get good grades and a little bit accomplished,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   even if you are dedicated to understanding the system.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Ironically, I have an outline somewhere in my notes
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   for a show that I had planned to do.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I'll just give you the teaser of it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Did you know that the rate of--
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   in which Scandinavia? I think it was Sweden--
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   that in one of the Scandinavian countries,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   which has a lot of social welfare,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   in which tuition is entirely free,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   did you know that-- I think it's Sweden--
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   has some of the highest rates of student loan balances,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   even though the college itself is free,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   without tuition, for everybody?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's astonishing.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Whereas in the United States,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   there's so much money available for you,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   not only with regard to scholarships and financial aid,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   real financial aid, not loans,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   but in all kinds of grants and fellowships
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and things that are available to you,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   but even just in terms of the low cost.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Let me stay on track.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   The point is, back to the $150,000 school.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Now let's change it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Let's assume that I tell you you can go to a college
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and the college or some benefactor
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   is going to pay the full cost of $150,000 for you.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   That $150,000 is going to cover all your tuition,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   all of your room and board,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   all of your expenses, your books,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   everything for you.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And all you got to do is go to college and get good grades.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Well, now everything changes
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   because the normal course load
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   in a university is laughably easy.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Full-time is considered to be 12 to 18 credit hours per week
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   over the course of two academic semesters per year.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Let's say you're taking a full course load of 18 hours per week.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Now, my engineering students and my mathematics students
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and somebody, maybe the physics student,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   something like that, will quickly know
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   that yes, you do actually have to do homework.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I never even dreamed of doing an hour of homework
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   for every hour of class,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   even though I probably should have.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I never did that.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Not a single time did I ever do an hour of homework
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   for an hour of class.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So, but let's say that you do.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Let's say that you're going to do an hour of homework
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   for every hour of class.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You're up to 36 hours a week of obligation.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Let's say that you are an engineering student
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   or a physics student,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and now you're going to do two hours of homework
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   reliably and consistently for every one hour of class,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   and you're going to take 18 credit hours.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Guess what your obligation is?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   54 hours a week.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   54 hours a week, that's it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And you're living in a place where you walk to class,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   you walk back to your dorm room.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   That is the easiest life anybody can imagine.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   You have another 60 hours a week available to you
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   that you could do anything you want.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   There's nothing you can't do when you're in college,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   even if you're taking a full load.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   So all of the things that people alternatively say,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   they say, "Well, you know what?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I shouldn't go to college because I want to start a business."
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Guess what? Go start the business.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Let someone pay for your college degree.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Go start the business.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Or they say, "I've got to work." You can work.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   My senior year of college is about the only year of college
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   that I'm actually proud of.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I took 19 hours of class, both semesters,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   senior capstone courses.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I worked 40 hours a week at a job I had to commute to.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I got straight A's, and I still had plenty of time
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   for fun and travel.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   It worked fine.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   So you can work a 40-hour job.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   You don't have to choose is the point.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   This is what's fallacious about everyone who argues about,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   "Should I go to college or should I not go to college?"
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   So if you're the kind of person who is college-bound
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   based upon either you can do academics or you can hustle
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and learn to do academics, you should go to college,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   especially if you can get people to pay for it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So how do you get people to pay for it?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Well, you sit down and you start figuring out
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   how the system works.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And the secret to the system is a couple-fold.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I'm doing a very focused podcast here.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I probably should teach a 20-hour class on it.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But the basic idea is you need to highly qualify yourself
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   on the metrics that people are looking for for qualifications
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and then market yourself to all of the people
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   who are looking for qualified people like you.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Now, there's a little bit of distinction that we need to make
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   because the kinds of things that a student should do
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   to qualify himself, for example, to get into an elite university
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   are often different than the kinds of things
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   that a student should do to qualify himself
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   for getting a great scholarship.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   So I'm not talking today about admission to an elite university.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Here's what I never understood, though, when I was young.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I remember one time I was briefly--
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I was taking a class in college,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and someone told me about a Harvard MBA
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and how prestigious it was.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And I thought for a moment, "Hey, that'd be pretty cool.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   "Wouldn't it be fun to go and do something prestigious
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "like apply to Harvard?"
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So first thing I did was pulled up the tuition schedule
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   for the Harvard MBA program,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and actually at one point I actually toured the campus.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I was in Boston for a business trip of some kind,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   and I toured the campus.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And I thought, "Hey, that'd be pretty cool."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   But the first thing I did was saw the tuition,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and I immediately assumed, "Well, I can't afford that.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   "I can't do it."
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I didn't have any understanding
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   of how financial aid works for colleges.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So if you're interested in going into an elite university,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   what you need to know is that elite universities
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   have about a bazillion dollars in their funds,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   in their endowment funds,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and if you can get accepted to an elite university,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   regardless of your financial situation,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   you're going to be able to go.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I'm not sure that's always the right move,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   but just know that if you can get accepted
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   to an elite university, you're going to be able to go.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   But there are many other paths,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and if you want to go to college and not pay for it,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   you absolutely can make it happen.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You may not be able to do it at an elite university,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   but you can certainly do it at a high-quality university,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   because if your academic credentials are sufficient,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   you can get a merit-based full ride.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And a full ride, or even a full tuition,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   just to clarify the terms,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   a full tuition means they'll pay all your tuition costs,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   but you're still responsible for room and board and books and fees,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   or a full ride, in which case they'll pay for your tuition
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and your room and board and your books and your fees.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So these are available.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Full rides are available for an undergraduate degree.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Full rides are available for a graduate degree.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Full rides are available for law school.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Full rides are available for medical school.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   It's available if you are a great student.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And I'm convinced that anybody who has any ambition
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   to do something like that can become a great student,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   because study skills, learning skills,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   they're just skills that can be learned in practice,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and you can become a very effective learner.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And you can choose a major or something that's appropriate for you.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I'm not saying everyone can be a quantum physicist,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   just that you can find something that's appropriate for you,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and you can get a full ride based upon your academic qualifications.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So spending extra time on the weekend studying for school
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   is the right thing to do.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   If you want to know the right thing to do,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   find an Asian friend,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   go and ask their parents what they think you should do,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and do what their parents tell you to do.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   There's a great Asian stereotype for a reason
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   about their parents making sure their children do well in school.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Just do it,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and you'll open up a whole world of access
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   to great merit-based scholarships.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   However, that's just the tip of the iceberg
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   when it comes to scholarships.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   There are thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   of scholarships that you can apply for.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Here's what I never understood when I was in high school
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   that I desperately wish I had.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Applying for scholarships is pretty easy.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   It doesn't take that much time.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   All you got to do is find a scholarship
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   that you might in some way qualify for
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   or might be relevant for you in some possible way.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Usually you got to sit down and fill out an application,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and then usually you need to do something like write an essay
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   or demonstrate your qualification for the scholarship.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Now there's some pretty amazing scholarships
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   that will cover you for all of your tuition.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   There's scholarships out there that will pay for everything
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   from an undergraduate degree all the way through a PhD, 100%.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   You're going to have to hustle for years to do those things.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   But all the things you do to ultimately get those scholarships
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   are all the things you should be doing, period,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   to gain acceptance to an elite university,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   to get merit-based scholarships.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's all just the standard stuff of being
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   a highly motivated, success-oriented teenager.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And all it requires is a little bit of motivation
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   for you to do it.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And the whole world is wanting to coach you
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and wanting to help you as soon as you demonstrate
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   a little bit of initiative if you're a teen.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   There are also tons and tons of smaller scholarships
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   that all you got to do is you don't have to go
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and start some world-changing project
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   to end hunger and homelessness in your area.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   All you got to do is write an essay.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   What I never understood was the math of this.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And it wasn't until I was about a senior in college
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   that I finally sat down and realized what it was like.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I mentioned the scholarships that I got when I was in college,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   one of them being a Kiwanis scholarship.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And this was a local Kiwanis club where I was from,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and they gave out a very simple scholarship.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   The application for the scholarship
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   was simply an application that you made.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   You submitted your grades and other qualifications.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I don't remember now at this point.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I remember going for an interview,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   a simple interview with the team,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and I was granted the scholarship.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The scholarship was fairly modest.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I don't remember if it was $500 a semester
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   or $1,000 a semester, but it was something like that.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Let's call it $500 and be a little bit more modest.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It was a $500 scholarship.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And so every fall and every spring,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I and my parents would go to the Kiwanis scholarship luncheon.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And it got to be really great
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   because I didn't make any use of it at all.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But I got to know some interesting people
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   who were leaders in the community,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   members of the Kiwanis club.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I got to know and appreciate some of the people.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   There's so much more I could have done.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   When I coach college students,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I just want to grab them and shake them and say,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "Don't be as dumb as I was.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "This is your chance,"
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and teach them how to network with people.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Anyway, I was dumb.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   But I would go to this, and they would bring me up,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and they would give me the $500 check.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   They would feed us a nice lunch,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and we would see all the other scholarship recipients.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   It was great.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   It wasn't until the end of college
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   that I sat down and I tried to figure out
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   how much money did I actually get from Kiwanis?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And the answer, if it was $500 per semester,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   the answer, do the math,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   eight semesters, $4,000.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   That was how much money I got from the Kiwanis club, $4,000.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And all I had to do was fill in an application.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   It probably took 30, 60 minutes.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Go to a single interview.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It took not much time at all.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And then they fed me lunch and handed me $500 each semester, $4,000.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   What was my hourly rate for that Kiwanis scholarship that I got?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Let's assume, let's ignore the free lunches.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   There's no such thing as a free lunch,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   but sometimes there is if you get your grades right.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So let's say I had three hours, four hours into it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   My hourly rate was easily $1,000 an hour.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   $1,000 an hour I got paid for filling out an application
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   for a Kiwanis club scholarship in my local area.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   That's a pretty normal thing in the world of scholarships.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I remember when I became aware of scholarships,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   I would see sometimes the low value,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   a $250 scholarship, a $400 scholarship,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   and I just dismissed it as being pointless.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   What I didn't understand was it was a $250 per semester scholarship.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   A $1,000 scholarship in many cases is $1,000 per year
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   or $1,000 per semester.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And so if you're looking for a high-paying summer job,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   dear high school sophomore, dear high school junior,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   probably dear high school freshman,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   senior, yeah, you should still be doing it,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   starting when you're a freshman, you're a sophomore, and you're a junior.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I am convinced the highest-paying summer job
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   that you could possibly do is applying for scholarships.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Let's assume that you can apply for scholarships
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and let's assume that you can get one out of four,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   25% success ratio.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   From my research in the world of scholarships,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   for a reasonably qualified student,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   decent grades, decent test scores, good reputation,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   good involvement, a little bit of community service,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   those kinds of things,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I don't think that would be an unreasonable expectation
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   that you might get one out of four
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   or one out of five of the scholarships that you apply for.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So let's assume that it takes you on average
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   about three or four hours per scholarship.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I think that's pretty excessive, but I want to be very fair.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Once you have a system for organizing yourself,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I think many scholarship applications might take you an hour or two.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   The key thing that's going to take a while
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   is often going to be writing an essay.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   So your goal should be to get very good
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   at writing essays very, very quickly
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   and write a custom essay for each individual scholarship.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Let's assume that it takes you an hour
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   to write an essay of a page or two, maybe two hours.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So again, four hours per, let's do three, three hours per.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   So you apply for four different scholarships,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   four different $1,000 scholarships,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and you get one of the four.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's $1,000 a year usually for a small scholarship,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and all you got to do once you've gotten it
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   is do like what I did is show back up to the Kiwanis Club luncheon,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and there may have been an annual kind of check-in with me.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Forgive me, it's been a while now.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   But the requirements to maintain the scholarship are pretty low.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So it takes you three hours per scholarship application
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   times four for a total of 12 hours of work,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and you get one $4,000 scholarship
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   that's worth $4,000 over the course of four years.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   What's your hourly rate?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   4,000 divided by 12, $333 per hour.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But wait, there's more.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Scholarship money, when it's used to pay for tuition, is tax-free.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So it's even better than, you know,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   what would you have to pay for that
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   to go out and work in order to earn the $333 per hour?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Where are you going to make $333 per hour consistently?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And then what would you have to do to go out and actually make it post-tax?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The numbers are beautiful when you start digging into them.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   They're fantastic.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So the question is how many scholarship applications could you make
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   if you were really motivated?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Here's another little thing that I never knew.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I never knew that there's no limit
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   as to how many scholarships you can win.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I knew this a little bit
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   because I had a sister who got really good grades,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and she got a high-merit scholarship from her university,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and so she got paid to go to university.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   But it wasn't very much.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It was some thousands of dollars.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It wasn't tens of thousands of dollars per year.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It wasn't until later I realized
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   that a motivated, dedicated student could pretty easily hack this system
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and be paid tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Now imagine--back to that college discussion that I said--
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   imagine that you did well with academics,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   so you were qualified in order to get into a college that you wanted to go to,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and imagine that all of your expenses are covered by your scholarships,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   all of your tuition payments,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   all of your own board, your books, your class fees--everything's covered.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And in addition to that,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   you've got $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year of pocket money
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   that's coming in from 15 or 17 different scholarships that you have won.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   What could college do for you in that circumstance?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   All you've got to do is stay in good standing with your college,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   go to class, get good grades.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   You should get good grades in college.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Go to class, get good grades.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   But you still have all the rest of the time available for you.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And you're being paid a couple thousand dollars a month,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   plus all of your expenses paid, for doing that.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Now what could you build,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   knowing that you're in college and you're getting a college degree,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   but you also have time to build your business, make connections.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Think of the internships, the unpaid internships you could get.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Think of the programs you could go on,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   the study abroad programs and all the different things you could do.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Now it completely changes the calculus of the college decision.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   So what's necessary to do that?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Well, first of all, you have to be capable of doing the work in the academic environment.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And I promise you, you are capable.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   If you're getting bad grades right now,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   it's probably just because you don't care
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and you don't understand how much of a difference this could make for you.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   It's also probably because you've never taken any training on how to study,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   how to learn effectively.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It's the dumbest thing in the world that will put students through a 12-year academic gauntlet
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   and only rarely will there be a caring teacher
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   who will give them a class on some useful study technique.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And the world of learning science has completely changed.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   The work that's been done over the last 20 years is outstanding.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So dig into the world of learning science.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Grab a book on how to learn.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Go to the library.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Take a course on how to learn.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   There's all kinds of stuff.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   There's great YouTube channels out there.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   My favorites are Benjamin Keepe, who has a YouTube channel on it,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and Justin Sung is one of the biggest ones.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So go to YouTube, put in Benjamin Keepe, K-E-E-P, and Justin Sung,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   and let the algorithm feed you that kind of stuff,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and learn how to study, learn how to learn, learn how to learn efficiently
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   so that you can get more work done in less time.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Then think about the stuff you're going to be involved in.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Doing well with academics is not sufficient for you to get into great colleges
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   and get other things.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   There's more to it.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   But the point is, go after it.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And if you're not currently doing it, start caring and doing it.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Then you need to just simply put in place a system
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   where you're going to handle all the stuff well.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   You're going to do well academically.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You're going to do well with your test scores,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   and you need to start collecting and build a system for applying for scholarships.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   If you're coaching people who are younger, younger than, say, ninth grade--
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   by the way, I think a good time to start this kind of discussion,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   obviously parents have to make the decision based on what their child can handle.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I don't want to create a meat grinder of a system
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   where we just yell at people all the time, and you've got to do this, you've got to do this.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I think there's benefit to childhood.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   But one of the things that you should focus on with students who are younger
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   is get them accustomed to the work.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So I've got a 10-year-old, and one of the things I'm really focusing on
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   is building all of the core skills.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   In the early years, it's really important that you build strong academics.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I've talked about that extensively elsewhere.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You need to have great readers, people who read all the time,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   because that's one of the most important ways to do that.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You need to be really good at math, so you should be doing math every single day
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   with a great math curriculum, constantly, every single day, building those math skills.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And then writing. Writing is a fundamental skill.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   So it needs to be fairly easy and simple for a student to sit down and bang out an essay.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And that's just a skill that can be built.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   High school students sit there and stare at a blank screen
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and can't bang out an essay in 90 minutes because they're not trained on it
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and they're not practiced on it.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So get a great writing curriculum and get them banging out essays every day.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And when you get to the point where you can churn out essays,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   then it's going to be pretty simple.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I heard an idea recently. I was listening to a scholarship advisor talk about this,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and she said she had a friend of hers who would pay –
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   he would pay his children very young, before high school,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I think late elementary school and middle school.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He had a system where he would pay his children $5
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   for every scholarship application that they made.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And he didn't care whether they were even eligible.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   He didn't care whether they were able to do it.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   He just paid them for making the application.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And his point was that by starting in seventh grade,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   and now he's paid them $5 per scholarship application,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   he's got them lined up so that when they're eligible at ninth grade,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   not only do they have a bunch of essays that they've thought through
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   for all these scholarships they've applied to and, of course, not gotten over the years,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   but now he can start pooling from them and say,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   "All right, let's grab this essay that you wrote previously. Let's polish it up."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And they're all ready to start actually making those applications.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And I thought, "Brilliant. Brilliant. I'm going to do it."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I don't know if $5 is the right number, but it sounds pretty good.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   You know, get a student used to doing two or three applications a day,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   and you've got an amazingly productive thing to do.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Now, scholarships are not the only thing.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   So back to the comment I made where I said this could pay off in a couple of years.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   One of the things that people ignore is they ignore all the things that can be done during high school,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   all of the youth congresses and the study abroad programs.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I was going through a bunch of stuff this past week looking at all the programs the U.S. government does.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   The U.S. government will pay for all of your expenses, all your expenses to go and study abroad for a year,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   go to Germany, take a year of school in Germany or in Georgia or in many places.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   There's all these youth congresses and all these things.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I never even imagined applying for any of that stuff.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I don't know why I didn't. I was dumb. Don't be like me.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I just never thought that was my thing.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I didn't see myself as the kind of person who could do that stuff or who would do that stuff,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   and I'd never want to set the example for me.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And so if you're coaching your child, obviously you know what your child needs,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   but this stuff's available to you. It's all out there.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And that stuff can be paying off even just during high school,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   where you can do it pretty early, and it just builds your story.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   It builds the whole package.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   So I beg you, don't be dumb like me.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Don't think that, "Oh, I just have to sit back here,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and the only pathway to my dreams is for me to work and earn money."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   No, it's not true.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   There are many pathways, and there are rich people, mega billionaires,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   who have created all kinds of charitable foundations to throw money at you.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And all you've got to do is qualify yourself for that,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and then expose yourself to it by making the applications.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I'm not going to go into any more technical details.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I just want you to know, if you're a teenager,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   or if you're coming up on your teenage years,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   and/or if you're coaching a teenager in some way, shape, or form,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   your teens can reliably and consistently earn
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   more than $100 an hour through this system,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and in some cases, much more than $100 an hour.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   There is no higher-paying job or opportunity
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   that is as consistent and effective
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   for a motivated, organized, and disciplined teenager
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   than getting good grades, getting good test scores,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   getting on the pathway into college based upon acceptance,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   extracurriculars, community service, community involvement,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   having one thing that you're really into that tells your story effectively,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and applying for lots of scholarships.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   There's no reason why the kind of student
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   who should be going to college from an academic perspective
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   shouldn't be paid to go to college in our current system.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Do it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   There's lots of people out there--
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   sorry, there's some people out there who've done it.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   You can do it, too.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   It will pay off in the long run.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   If I went over my list of the stuff you could do
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   with those four college years,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   given the numbers that I described to you
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   of what's possible to you just of college being paid for
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   and all you got to do is get good grades,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   it's astonishing what you could accomplish
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   during that phase of your life.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   But it starts in your teens.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's summertime.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   This is the right summer job for you to be focused on now.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Mercedes-Benz Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles.

[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and a rigorous inspection process
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   so you can make your dream car a reality.
