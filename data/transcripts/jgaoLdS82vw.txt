[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.080]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.640]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.360]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.440]   to the general public.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.960]   Today, I want to talk about something
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.460]   that is vitally important
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.640]   for not just athletic performance,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.160]   but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.780]   and that's muscle.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260]   And one of the things that's exquisite
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.060]   and fantastic about the human brain
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.240]   is that it can direct all sorts
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.760]   of different kinds of movement,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.540]   different speeds of movement,
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.480]   movement of different durations.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.180]   All of that is governed by the relationship
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.560]   between the nervous system, neurons,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.920]   and their connections to muscle.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.940]   So today, as always,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.020]   we're going to talk a little bit of mechanism.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.240]   I'm going to explain how neurons control muscle.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440]   We will touch on some nutritional themes
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.180]   and how that relates to muscle,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.480]   in particular, a specific amino acid
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.780]   that if it's available in your bloodstream frequently enough
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.300]   and at sufficient levels can help you build
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.780]   and improve the quality of muscle.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620]   We are also going to talk about recovery.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.260]   That's when muscle grows.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.280]   That's when muscle gets more flexible.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.740]   None of that actually happens during training.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.440]   It happens after training.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.440]   Most people, when they hear the word muscle,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.080]   they just think about strength.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.140]   But of course, muscles are involved
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.960]   in everything that we do.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.280]   They are involved in speaking.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460]   They're involved in sitting and standing up.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.220]   They're involved in lifting objects,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.680]   including ourselves.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.560]   They are absolutely essential
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.960]   for maintaining how we breathe.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.960]   They're absolutely essential for ambulation,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320]   for moving and for skills of any kind.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.200]   So when we think about muscle,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.520]   we don't just want to think about muscle,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   the meat that is muscle,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.860]   but what controls that muscle.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.360]   And no surprise,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.680]   what controls muscle is the nervous system.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.620]   The nervous system does that
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.880]   through three main nodes of control.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.700]   Basically, we have upper motor neurons
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.780]   in our motor cortex.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.400]   So those are in our skull.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.840]   And those are involved in deliberate movement.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.860]   Those upper motor neurons send signals
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.200]   down to my spinal cord,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.220]   where there are two categories of neurons.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.420]   One are the lower motor neurons.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.760]   And those lower motor neurons send little wires
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.980]   that we call axons out to our muscles
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.260]   and cause those muscles to contract.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.540]   They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.400]   In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120]   Now there's another category of neurons
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.320]   in the spinal cord called central pattern generators
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   or CPGs.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.580]   And those are involved in rhythmic movements.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.480]   Anytime we're walking or doing something
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.980]   where we don't have to think about it
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.260]   to do it deliberately,
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.340]   it's just happening reflexively
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.760]   that central pattern generators and motor neurons.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.560]   Anytime we're doing something deliberately,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.460]   that the top-down control, as we call it,
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.400]   from the upper motor neurons comes in
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.160]   and takes control of that system.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.360]   So it's really simple.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.580]   You've only got three ingredients.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.680]   You got the upper motor neurons,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.700]   the lower motor neurons,
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.880]   and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.780]   you've also got the central pattern generators.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.580]   I'd now like to shift our attention
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.400]   to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.700]   to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.280]   as well as improving muscle strength.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.880]   There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.580]   And I should just mention that it's not always the case
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640]   that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.860]   There are ways for muscles to get stronger
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.820]   without getting bigger.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.720]   However, increasing the size of a muscle
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.760]   almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.000]   at least to some degree.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.260]   Reasons why most everyone should want
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.780]   to get their muscles stronger
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.260]   is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.560]   across the lifespan.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.420]   So when I say getting stronger,
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.580]   it's not necessarily about being able to move
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.640]   increasing amounts of weight in the gym,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.080]   but rather to offset some of the normal decline
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.580]   in strength and posture
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.940]   and the ability to generate a large range of movement safely
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.380]   that occurs as we age.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.920]   So there's an important principle of muscle physiology
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.060]   called the Henneman size principle.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.180]   And the Henneman size principle essentially says
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.260]   that we recruit what are called motor units.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.640]   Motor units are just the connections
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.020]   between nerve and muscle in a pattern
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.060]   that staircases from low threshold to high threshold.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.360]   What this means is when you pick up something that is light,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   you're going to use the minimum amount
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.580]   of nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.780]   Likewise, when you pick up an object that's heavy,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.360]   you're going to use the minimum amount
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.180]   in order to move that object.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.880]   So it's basically a conservation of energy principle.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.680]   Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.560]   what will happen is you will tend to recruit
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.540]   more and more motor units with time.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.780]   As you recruit more and more of these motor units,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.480]   these connections between these lower motor neurons
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.960]   and muscle,
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.800]   that's when you start to get changes in the muscle.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.320]   That's when you open the gate for the potential
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.200]   for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.980]   And so the way this process works
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.520]   has been badly misunderstood
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.460]   in the kind of online literature of weight training
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.280]   and bodybuilding,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.820]   and even in sports physiology.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.740]   The Henneman size principle
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.000]   is kind of a foundational principle
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.200]   within muscle physiology.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.340]   But many people have come to interpret it
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.300]   by saying that the way to recruit
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.060]   high threshold motor units,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.580]   the ones that are hard to get to,
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.740]   is to just use heavy weights.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.320]   And that's actually not the case.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   As we'll talk about,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.220]   the research supports
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.440]   that weights in a very large range
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.560]   of sort of percentage of your maximum,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.300]   anywhere from 30 to 80%.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.860]   So weights that are not very light,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.260]   but are moderately light,
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.340]   too heavy,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.020]   can cause changes in the connections
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.000]   between nerve and muscle
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.620]   that lead to muscle strength
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.480]   and muscle hypertrophy.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.640]   Put differently,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.400]   heavy weights can help build muscle and strength,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.720]   but they are not required.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.260]   What one has to do
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.640]   is adhere to a certain number of parameters,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.500]   just a couple of key variables
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.660]   that I'll spell out for you.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.940]   And if you do that,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.220]   you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.140]   muscle size,
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.040]   and or muscle strength
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.020]   if that's what you want to do.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.980]   And you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.960]   in order to do that.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.480]   Now, I'm sure the power lifters
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.080]   and the people that like to move heavy weights around
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.300]   will say,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.860]   no, if you want to get strong,
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.960]   you absolutely have to lift heavy weights.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.020]   And that might be true
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.740]   if you want to get very strong,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.060]   but for most people
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.360]   who are interested in supporting their muscular
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.600]   such that they offset
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.840]   any age-related decline in strength
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.980]   or in increasing hypertrophy
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.020]   and strength to some degree,
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.840]   there really isn't a need
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.340]   to use the heaviest weights possible
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.700]   in order to build strength and muscle.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.820]   So there are three major stimuli
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.920]   for changing the way that muscle works
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.720]   and making muscles stronger,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.320]   larger,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.940]   or better in some way.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.580]   And those are stress,
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.920]   tension,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.220]   and damage.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.560]   Those three things
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.740]   don't necessarily all have to be present,
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.180]   but stress of some kind has to exist.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.680]   So this is very reminiscent
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.180]   of neuroplasticity in the brain.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.000]   There is a good predictor
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.140]   of how well
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.580]   or how efficient you will be
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.980]   in building the strength
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.120]   and or if you like
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.940]   the size of a given muscle.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.740]   And it has everything to do
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.180]   with those upper motor neurons
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.820]   that are involved
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.280]   in deliberate control of muscle.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.400]   You can actually do this test right now.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.100]   You can just kind of march
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.600]   across your body mentally
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.380]   and see whether or not
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.340]   you can independently contract
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.680]   any or all of your muscles.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   Because everything
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.060]   about muscle hypertrophy,
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.540]   about stimulating muscle growth
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.800]   is about generating
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.600]   isolated contractions,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.660]   about challenging specific muscles
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.480]   in a very unnatural way.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.880]   Whereas with strength,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.380]   it's about using musculature
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.220]   as a system,
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.820]   moving weights,
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.680]   moving resistance,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.760]   moving the body.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.420]   The specific goal of hypertrophy
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.420]   is to isolate specific nerve
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.360]   to muscle pathways
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.600]   so that you stimulate
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.300]   the chemical
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.240]   and signaling transduction events
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.800]   in muscles
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.080]   so that those muscles respond
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.160]   by getting larger.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.200]   So there's a critical distinction
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.660]   in terms of getting stronger
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.300]   versus trying to get muscles
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.960]   to be larger hypertrophy per se.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.140]   And it has to do
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.300]   with how much you isolate those muscles.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.000]   So you can nest this
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.340]   as a principle for yourself,
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.280]   which is if you want to get stronger,
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.760]   it's really about moving
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.100]   progressively greater loads
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.380]   or increasing the amount
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.520]   of weight that you move.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.480]   Whereas if you're specifically interested
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.600]   in generating hypertrophy,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.220]   it's all about trying
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.940]   to generate those really hard,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.260]   almost painful,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.440]   localized contractions of muscle.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.960]   If ever there was an area
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.000]   of practical science
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.860]   that was very confused,
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.800]   very controversial,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.740]   and almost combative at times,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.660]   it would be this issue
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.160]   of how best to train.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.280]   I suppose the only thing
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   that's even more barbed wire
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.340]   of a conversation than that
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.120]   is how best to eat for health.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.320]   Those seem to be the two most common areas
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.920]   of online battle.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.520]   What's very clear now
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.140]   from all the literature
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.400]   is that once you know roughly
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.180]   your one repetition maximum,
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.600]   the maximum amount of weight
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.680]   that you can perform an exercise with
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.780]   for one repetition in good form,
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.200]   full range of motion,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.580]   that it's very clear
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.980]   that moving weights
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.880]   or using bands
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.500]   or using body weight,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.280]   for instance,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.980]   in the 30 to 80%
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.200]   of one rep maximum,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.780]   that is going to be
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.480]   the most beneficial range
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.940]   in terms of muscle hypertrophy
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.720]   and strength.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.880]   So muscle growth and strength.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.040]   So let's say you're somebody
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.120]   who's been doing
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.660]   some resistance exercise
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.720]   kind of on and off
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.240]   over the years
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.160]   and you decide
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.940]   you want to get serious
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.240]   about that for sake of sport
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.480]   or offsetting age-related
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.800]   declines in strength.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.940]   The range of sets to do
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.840]   in order to improve strength
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.400]   ranges anywhere from two,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.460]   believe it or not,
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.000]   to 20 per week.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.580]   Again, these are sets per week
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.660]   and they don't necessarily
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.700]   all have to be performed
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.540]   in the same weight training session.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.060]   It appears that five sets per week
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.880]   in this 30% to 80%
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.060]   of the one repetition maximum range
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.920]   is what's required
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.680]   just to maintain your muscle.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.500]   So think about that.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.220]   If you're somebody
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.000]   who's kind of averse
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.960]   to resistance training,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.480]   you are going to lose
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.060]   muscle size and strength.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.260]   Your metabolism will drop.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.580]   Your posture will get worse.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.620]   Everything in the context
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.920]   of nerve to muscle connectivity
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.600]   will get worse over time
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.920]   unless you are generating
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.280]   five sets
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.500]   or more
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.860]   of this 30% to 80%
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.760]   of your one repetition
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.180]   maximum per week.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.840]   Okay?
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.040]   So what this means is
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.120]   for the typical person
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.600]   who hasn't done
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.360]   a lot of weight training,
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.480]   you need to do at least
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.720]   five sets per muscle group.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.860]   Now, that's just to maintain
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.860]   and then there's this huge range
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.160]   that goes all the way up to 15
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.800]   and in some case
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.920]   20 sets per week.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.320]   Now, how many sets you perform
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.940]   is going to depend on
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.500]   the intensity of the work
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.140]   that you perform.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.580]   This is where it gets
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.760]   a little bit controversial,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   but I think nowadays
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.660]   most people agree
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.160]   that 10% of the sets
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.420]   of a given workout
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.200]   or 10% of workouts overall
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.920]   should be of the high intensity sort
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.080]   where one is actually working
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.140]   to muscular failure.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.020]   But the point being
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.620]   that most of your training,
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.700]   most of your sets
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.180]   should be not to failure.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.960]   And the reason for that
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   is it allows you
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.840]   to do more volume of work.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   So we can make this simple,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   perform anywhere from
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.540]   five to 15 sets
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.400]   of resistance exercise
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.100]   per week
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.860]   and that's per muscle
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.400]   and that's in this
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.780]   30 to 80%
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.520]   of what your one
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.460]   repetition maximum.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.420]   That seems to be
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.860]   the most scientifically
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.760]   supported way
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.200]   of offsetting
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.220]   any decline
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.140]   in muscle strength
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.080]   if you're working
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.200]   in the kind of five set range
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.140]   and in increasing
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.980]   muscle strength
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.000]   when you start
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.580]   to get up
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.100]   into the 10
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.400]   and 15 set range.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.540]   But it's pretty clear
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.360]   that performing
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.940]   this five to 15 sets
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.440]   per week,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.160]   whether or not
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.040]   it's in one workout
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.940]   or whether it's divided
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.180]   up across multiple workouts
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.040]   is really what's
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.880]   going to be most beneficial.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.000]   And please do keep in mind
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.120]   Henneman's size principle
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.760]   and the recruitment
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.500]   of motor units
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.980]   and remember
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.120]   the better you are
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.700]   at contracting
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.540]   particular muscles
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.920]   and isolating those muscles,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.960]   the fewer sets
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.300]   likely you need to do
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.040]   in order to get
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   the desired effect.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.820]   What about people
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.260]   who have been
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.220]   training for a while?
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.740]   If you're somebody
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.500]   who's been doing
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:19.940]   weight training
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.500]   for a while,
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.740]   the data point
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.240]   to the fact
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.700]   that more volume
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.640]   can be beneficial
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   even for muscles
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.440]   that you are very
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.400]   efficient at contracting.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.820]   Now, the curve on this,
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.700]   the graph on this
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.060]   begins again
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.060]   at about five sets
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.560]   per week
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.280]   for maintaining
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.220]   a given muscle group
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.060]   and extends
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.640]   all the way out
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.980]   to 25 or 30 sets
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.480]   per week.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.460]   However,
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.000]   there are individuals
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.440]   who for whatever reason
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.020]   can generate
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.040]   can generate
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   so much force.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.940]   They're so good
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.140]   at training muscles
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.420]   that they can generate
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.360]   so much force
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.740]   in just four
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.280]   or six
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.160]   or eight sets
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.240]   that doing this
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.260]   large volume of work
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.840]   is actually going
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.900]   to be counterproductive.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.480]   So everyone needs
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.120]   to figure out
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.780]   for themselves,
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.580]   first of all,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.460]   how often you're willing
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.340]   to do resistance
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.760]   exercise of any kind.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.960]   And then it does appear
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.360]   that somewhere
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.760]   between five
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.700]   and 15 sets
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.200]   per week
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.120]   is going to be
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   what's the thing
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.660]   that's going to work
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.420]   for most people.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.200]   Now this is based
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.880]   on a tremendous
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.520]   amount of work
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.020]   that was done
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.820]   by Andy Galpin
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.260]   and colleagues,
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.060]   Brad Schoenfield
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.600]   and colleagues,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.520]   Mike Roberts.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.080]   There's a huge group
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.380]   of people out there
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.740]   doing exercise physiology
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.080]   and a small subset
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.480]   of them
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.300]   that are linking
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.020]   them back
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.420]   to real world protocols
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.620]   that don't just
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.480]   pertain to athletes.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.100]   So that's mainly
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.780]   what I'm focusing
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.280]   on today
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:33.800]   and surely
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.340]   there will be
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:34.860]   exceptions.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.840]   Now,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.220]   if you are going
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.360]   to divide the sets
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.840]   across the week,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.400]   you're not going
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.380]   to do all 10 sets
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:41.840]   for instance
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.760]   for a given muscle group
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.440]   in one session,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.580]   then of course
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.380]   it's imperative
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.120]   that the muscles
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.520]   recover in between sessions.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.320]   You might ask,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.600]   well,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.940]   what about the speeds
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.480]   of movements?
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.560]   This actually turns out
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.140]   to be a really
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.360]   interesting data set.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.720]   For generating
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.900]   explosiveness
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.940]   and speed,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.180]   it's very clear
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.800]   that learning
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.140]   to generate forces
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.680]   quickly
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.560]   and to move
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.960]   heavy or moderately
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.500]   heavy loads
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.020]   quickly
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.280]   is going to be
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:05.720]   beneficial
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.480]   because of the way
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.120]   that you train
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.340]   the motor neurons
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.440]   and of course
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.360]   changes in the muscle
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.340]   and so what this
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.820]   would involve
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.000]   is something
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.660]   like 60 to 75%
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.460]   of a one repetition
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:15.940]   maximum
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.660]   and then in a
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.400]   controlled way
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.220]   moving that
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.880]   as quickly
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.900]   as one can
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.880]   throughout the entire
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.280]   set
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   and certainly
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.380]   not going
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.440]   to failure
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.080]   because as you
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.960]   approach failure
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   the inability
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.220]   to move the weight
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:26.920]   with good form
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.720]   the weight
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.180]   inevitably slows down.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.860]   So as you're
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.440]   probably starting
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:30.880]   to realize
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.380]   you need to
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.000]   customize
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.200]   a resistance
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.480]   practice
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.440]   for your
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:35.820]   particular
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.180]   needs
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.640]   and goals.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.100]   So we've
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.460]   talked about
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.160]   a few principles
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.540]   the fact
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:38.960]   that you need
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.220]   to get
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.040]   sufficient volume
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.460]   you need
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.720]   at least
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.220]   five sets
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.760]   to maintain
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.000]   and you
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.400]   probably need
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.800]   about 10
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.180]   sets per
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.660]   muscle group
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.280]   in order
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.900]   to improve
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.320]   muscle
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   that moving
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:46.660]   weights
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.180]   of moderate
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.500]   to moderately
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.000]   heavy weight
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.780]   quickly is going
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.160]   to be best
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.900]   for explosiveness
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.800]   that isolating
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.300]   muscles
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.400]   and really
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.920]   contracting
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.320]   muscles
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.720]   hard
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.000]   something
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.260]   that you
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.820]   can test
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.740]   by just
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.280]   when you're
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.860]   outside the
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.500]   training session
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.860]   seeing whether
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.000]   or not
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.420]   you can cramp
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.740]   the muscle
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:15:59.980]   hard
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.440]   will really
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.400]   tell you
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.420]   your capacity
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.240]   to improve
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.320]   hypertrophy
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.340]   or to engage
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.160]   strength changes
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.920]   in that muscle
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.040]   that your ability
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.580]   to contract
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:10.860]   a muscle
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.160]   hard
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.040]   is inversely
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.660]   related to
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.000]   the number
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.360]   of sets
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.860]   that you
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.420]   should do
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:14.780]   in order
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.400]   to isolate
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.520]   and stimulate
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.180]   that muscle.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.460]   Now how long
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:18.900]   to recover
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.540]   between sets
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.200]   there's a question
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.100]   for the testosterone
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.760]   protocol
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.660]   Duncan French
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.120]   and colleagues
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   found that
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:23.900]   it was about
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.520]   two minutes
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.000]   keeping that
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.700]   really on the
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:25.940]   clock
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.520]   two minutes
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.520]   not longer
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.980]   for hypertrophy
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.600]   and for strength
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:29.920]   gains
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.360]   it does seem
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.820]   that resting
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.480]   anywhere from
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.060]   two minutes
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.800]   or even
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.380]   three
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:34.960]   or four
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.260]   or even
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.580]   five
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.000]   or six
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.400]   minutes
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.980]   can be
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.400]   beneficial
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.140]   so how do
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.380]   we know
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:38.720]   if we've
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.140]   recovered
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.560]   how can
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.160]   we test
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.720]   recovery
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.180]   and this
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.500]   is not
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.060]   just recovery
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.720]   from resistance
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.120]   training
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.920]   this is recovery
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.880]   from running
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.320]   recovery
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:45.960]   from swimming
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.080]   up until now
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.560]   I've been talking
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.120]   about resistance
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.660]   training more
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:48.880]   or less
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.600]   in a vacuum
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.880]   I haven't
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.520]   even touched
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.980]   on the fact
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.540]   that many people
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.120]   are running
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.600]   and they're
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.200]   doing resistance
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.640]   training
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.020]   or they're
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.320]   swimming
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.780]   and they're
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.340]   doing resistance
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.740]   training
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.380]   well
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.380]   you can
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.020]   assess
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.820]   systemic
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.480]   recovery
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.940]   meaning
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.720]   your nervous
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.180]   system
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   and your
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.500]   nervous
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:03.860]   system's
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.160]   ability
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.980]   to generate
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.680]   force
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.740]   both distributed
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.460]   and isolated
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.800]   through three
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.060]   main tests
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.940]   and fortunately
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.580]   these tests
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.520]   are very simple
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.600]   and two of them
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.780]   are essentially
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.480]   zero cost
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.100]   require no
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.580]   equipment
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   HRV
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.260]   heart rate
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.820]   variability
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.580]   has made
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.020]   its way
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.540]   finally
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.460]   into the
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:24.820]   forefront
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.500]   of exercise
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.080]   physiology
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:26.640]   and even
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.060]   into the
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.360]   popular
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.900]   discussion
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.880]   I've talked
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.620]   about HRV
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.040]   before
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.920]   how when we
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.480]   exhale our
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:31.840]   heart rate
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.460]   slows down
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.900]   because of the
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.260]   way that our
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.860]   diaphragm is
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.360]   connected to
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.820]   our heart
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.220]   and to our
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.480]   brain
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.800]   and the way
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.100]   our brain
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.500]   is connected
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:36.780]   to our
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:36.980]   heart
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.620]   when we
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.200]   inhale
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.740]   our heart
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:38.900]   rate
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.560]   speeds up
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.020]   and that
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.320]   is the
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.600]   basis
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.040]   of heart
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.220]   rate
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.760]   variability
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.920]   heart rate
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.400]   variability
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.280]   is good
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.480]   but heart
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.060]   rate variability
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.780]   is difficult
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.300]   for a lot
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.580]   of people
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:47.980]   to measure
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.540]   there are
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:48.720]   two
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.100]   measures
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.400]   however
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:49.840]   whether or
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.040]   not you
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.460]   recovered
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.980]   that you
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.380]   can use
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.840]   first thing
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.060]   in the
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.380]   morning
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:52.740]   when you
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.720]   wake up
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.140]   in order
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.840]   to assess
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.820]   how well
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.200]   recovered
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.520]   you are
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:56.860]   and therefore
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.240]   whether or
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.540]   not you
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.120]   should train
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.900]   your whole
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.500]   system at
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.100]   all that
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.380]   day
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.220]   the first
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.260]   one is
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.040]   grip strength
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   grip strength
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.200]   the ability
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.780]   to generate
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.480]   force at the
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:07.880]   level of
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.520]   squeezing the
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:08.900]   fist
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.800]   or you know
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.420]   squeezing down
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:10.960]   on something
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.680]   might seem
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.060]   like kind
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.820]   of a trivial
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.720]   way to assess
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.240]   recovery
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   but it's
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.180]   not because
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.680]   it relates
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.100]   to your
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.500]   ability
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.280]   to use
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.720]   your upper
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.420]   motor neurons
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.920]   to control
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.380]   your lower
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.980]   motor neurons
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.340]   and to
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.820]   generate
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.500]   isolated
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.140]   force
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.860]   so that's
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.160]   really what
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.680]   you're assessing
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.460]   when you
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:24.920]   do that
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.860]   some people
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.800]   will use
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.300]   you know
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.780]   one of these
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.860]   grip tools
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.680]   if I've been
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.520]   working really
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.340]   hard not sleeping
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.820]   very well
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.180]   or I've been
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.880]   training a lot
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.540]   any one or
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.080]   combination of
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.500]   those things
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.260]   my grip
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.640]   suffers
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.120]   I can't
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.760]   actually squeeze
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.120]   that thing
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.740]   down as much
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.080]   as I can
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.580]   but on a
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:38.860]   good day
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.120]   I can
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.420]   squeeze
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:39.800]   this thing
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.220]   so that I
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.560]   eliminate
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.060]   the hole
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.320]   in the
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:41.560]   donut
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:41.920]   so to
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.120]   speak
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.640]   you can
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.100]   also take
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.460]   a floor
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.060]   scale
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.040]   and squeeze
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.640]   the scale
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.020]   and see
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.320]   how much
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.620]   force
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:46.900]   you can
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.320]   generate
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.080]   I would
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.360]   do that
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.640]   as a
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.080]   baseline
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.800]   to establish
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.520]   what you
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:50.880]   can do
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.240]   when you're
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.840]   well rested
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.700]   and then if
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.080]   you do that
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.500]   in the morning
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.000]   you can see
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.500]   whether or not
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:54.960]   you're able
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.420]   to generate
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:55.780]   the same
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.160]   amount of
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.500]   force
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.120]   a lot
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.340]   of this
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.600]   is very
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.060]   subjective
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.440]   with the
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:58.780]   scale
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.480]   you're really
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:18:59.800]   trying to
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.100]   assess
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.520]   whether or not
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:00.860]   you can
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.180]   generate
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.500]   the same
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:01.720]   amount
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.180]   of force
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.680]   if you
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:02.940]   start
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.140]   seeing
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.860]   a 10%
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.620]   or 20%
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.040]   certainly
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.540]   reduction
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:05.980]   in that
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.720]   that's
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.140]   concerning
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.500]   it means
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:07.760]   that your
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.360]   system
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.440]   your nervous
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.740]   system
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.160]   as a whole
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.960]   it's not
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.500]   necessarily
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.460]   fatigued
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.160]   it's that
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.860]   the pathways
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.520]   from nerve
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.060]   to muscle
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.280]   are still
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:16.900]   in the process
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.660]   of rewiring
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.200]   themselves
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.840]   in order
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.400]   to generate
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.960]   force
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.280]   and you
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.640]   might think
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:20.860]   well
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.480]   I trained
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:21.960]   one muscle
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.180]   group
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.460]   one day
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:22.900]   why am I
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.400]   having a hard
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.740]   time doing
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.160]   this for a
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.420]   completely
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.760]   different
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.020]   muscle
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.320]   group
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.740]   doesn't
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.100]   make any
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.400]   sense
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.100]   but there's
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.360]   something
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:27.880]   about the
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.120]   upper
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:28.760]   motor neuron
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.180]   to lower
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.620]   motor neuron
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:29.980]   pathway
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.520]   generally
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.700]   that
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.400]   allows you
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.720]   to use
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:32.960]   something
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.380]   like grip
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.700]   strength
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.040]   as a
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.240]   kind
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.660]   of a
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.600]   thermometer
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.140]   if you
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:36.400]   will
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   of
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.600]   your
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:37.880]   ability
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.040]   to
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.380]   recover
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:38.820]   so look
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.100]   for your
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.360]   ability
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.880]   to generate
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.340]   force
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:40.860]   and grip
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.160]   when you
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.740]   first wake
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:41.960]   up
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.540]   it's not
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:42.780]   going to be
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.080]   as good
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.560]   as it is
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.700]   at 3 p.m.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.160]   after a cup
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.640]   of coffee
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.620]   and a couple
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.000]   meals
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.540]   but the
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.180]   point isn't
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.340]   performance
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.920]   overall
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.400]   the point
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:50.700]   is to
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.040]   assess
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.340]   whether or
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:51.420]   not
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:51.600]   you're
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:51.820]   getting
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.240]   better
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.600]   worse
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   or the
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.180]   same
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:53.660]   from day
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.080]   to day
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.860]   the other
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.020]   one
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.200]   that's
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.400]   really
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.800]   terrific
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.160]   is
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.500]   carbon
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.960]   dioxide
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.640]   tolerance
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.280]   so this
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:58.600]   is a
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:58.900]   really
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.320]   interesting
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.680]   tool
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:19:59.900]   that
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.500]   endurance
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.020]   athletes
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.620]   strength
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.120]   athletes
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.020]   I think
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.400]   can all
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:03.760]   benefit
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.080]   from
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:04.600]   so here's
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:04.840]   how you
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.180]   do the
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.380]   carbon
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:05.700]   dioxide
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.200]   tolerance
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.560]   test
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.140]   you wake
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.320]   up in
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.640]   the morning
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.400]   and what
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.700]   you're going
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:08.920]   to do
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.160]   is you're
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.540]   going to
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:09.940]   inhale
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.480]   through your
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.780]   nose
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.300]   as deeply
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.620]   as you
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:11.940]   can
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.260]   you do
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.620]   this lying
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:12.900]   down
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.060]   you know
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.540]   sitting
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:14.960]   whatever
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.780]   inhale
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.160]   through your
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.400]   nose
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.760]   and then
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.100]   exhale
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.500]   all the
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:18.720]   way
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.540]   so that's
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:20.880]   one
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.340]   you're going
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.740]   to repeat
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.420]   that four
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.020]   times
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.200]   then
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.840]   you take
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.400]   a fifth
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.900]   inhale
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.440]   as deep
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:26.700]   as you
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:26.940]   can
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.120]   through
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.260]   your
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:27.440]   nose
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.980]   fill
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.180]   your
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.440]   lungs
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:28.960]   as much
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.200]   as you
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.460]   can
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.080]   and if
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.380]   you can
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:30.940]   try and
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.620]   expand
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.240]   your
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.000]   make your
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.180]   stomach
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.580]   go out
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:33.900]   while you
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.220]   do that
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.680]   that means
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:34.960]   that your
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.460]   diaphragm
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:35.820]   is really
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.320]   engaged
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.660]   so you're
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.080]   inhaling
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:37.420]   as much
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:37.640]   as you
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.080]   possibly
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.440]   can
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.780]   then
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.160]   hit
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.380]   the
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.780]   timer
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.760]   and your
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.240]   goal
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.740]   is to
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.200]   release
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.780]   that air
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.600]   as slowly
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.460]   as possible
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.900]   through your
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.220]   mouth
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.680]   so it
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.360]   looks like
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:48.580]   you have
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:48.960]   a tiny
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.200]   tiny

[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.120]   in your
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.340]   mouth
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.600]   and you're
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:50.800]   letting
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.160]   it go
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.440]   as slowly
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:55.940]   as you
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.380]   possibly
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:56.800]   can
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.840]   measure
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.500]   what we
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:58.780]   call
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.180]   the

[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:04.780]   you can
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.160]   all sit
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.620]   with lungs
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:05.980]   empty
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.540]   after you
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.840]   eliminate
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.360]   all that
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:07.660]   air
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.780]   but don't
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.760]   lie to
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.160]   yourself
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.680]   don't
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.480]   stop the
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.780]   timer
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.500]   when you've

[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.760]   when you

[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.160]   I'm not

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.080]   I'm really

[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.180]   because
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.720]   everybody
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.400]   has different

[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.740]   abilities
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.260]   I realize
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.600]   people have
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.100]   varying levels
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.660]   of stress
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.200]   and demand
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.480]   in their
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:30.760]   life
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.300]   it's just
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.780]   impossible
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.060]   to prescribe
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.840]   an entire
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.640]   protocol
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.160]   that says
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.460]   okay
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.160]   yes you should
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.660]   train today
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.080]   and this is
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.620]   exactly what
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:37.840]   you should
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:37.960]   do
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.300]   no you
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:38.660]   shouldn't
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.060]   use
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.780]   carbon dioxide
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.640]   discard rate
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:40.920]   because
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.640]   A it's
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.220]   valuable
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:42.680]   it's
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.080]   informative
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.720]   B
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.300]   it's
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.560]   zero cost
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.160]   and C
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.900]   it's something
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.540]   you can track
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.060]   objectively
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.880]   over time
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.260]   and that's
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.660]   really the
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:50.920]   key
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.800]   so recovery
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.540]   is a complex
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.020]   process
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.500]   it's got
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:53.800]   a lot
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.220]   of things
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.300]   but the
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.600]   CO2
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:55.960]   tolerance
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.360]   should be
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.820]   a valuable
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.220]   tool
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.500]   now another
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:58.960]   tool for
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.320]   recovery
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:22:59.740]   that people
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.080]   are very
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.860]   excited about
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.440]   is the
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:01.780]   use of
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.160]   cold
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.480]   and the
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.000]   ice bath
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.620]   and this
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.400]   is important
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.700]   yes it
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.180]   will reduce
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.700]   inflammation
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.740]   yes it
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.500]   will reduce
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:08.920]   the amount
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.380]   of delayed

[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.680]   soreness
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.820]   but it
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.360]   does seem
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:12.900]   to interfere
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.300]   with some
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.500]   of the
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.020]   things like

[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.740]   are the
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.100]   stimulus
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.840]   for nerve

[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.100]   and so
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.480]   if you're
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.140]   getting into
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.540]   the ice
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:33.800]   bath
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.260]   after doing

[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.120]   training
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.940]   you are
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.320]   likely
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:36.740]   short
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.360]   circuiting
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.120]   the improvements
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.540]   that you're
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:38.900]   trying to
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.320]   create
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.040]   the other
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.300]   thing are
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:40.980]   non-steroid
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.840]   anti-inflammatory
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.200]   drugs
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.760]   you know
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.180]   their trade
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.480]   names
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.040]   these are
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.680]   painkillers
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.020]   that many
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.560]   people take
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.460]   those as i've
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:46.900]   mentioned in a
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:47.540]   previous episode
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.480]   seem to prevent
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.100]   a lot of the
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.600]   gains
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.660]   the improvements
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.880]   in endurance
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   strength and size
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.580]   that people are
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.740]   specifically using
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.940]   exercise for
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.880]   so be cautious
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.760]   about your use
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.900]   of non-steroid
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.740]   anti-inflammatory
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.440]   drugs
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.580]   especially within
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.420]   the four hours
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.360]   preceding or the
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:03.860]   four hours
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.500]   following
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   exercise
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.260]   let's talk
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.640]   about some
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:06.820]   of the
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.380]   things that
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.080]   seem to
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.860]   work across
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.420]   the board
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.320]   to improve
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:10.840]   strength
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.720]   improve
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.960]   hypertrophy
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.880]   and improve
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.480]   nerve to
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.760]   muscle
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.620]   communication
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.420]   and performance
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.000]   the first
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.540]   thing that's
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.480]   absolutely key
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.280]   for nerve to
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:19.560]   muscle
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.160]   communication
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.320]   and physical
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.760]   performance
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.120]   of any
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.480]   kind
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.460]   might not
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:23.840]   sound that
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.380]   exciting to
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:24.880]   you but it
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.540]   is very
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.020]   exciting
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.260]   and that's
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:27.700]   salt
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.080]   nerves
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.900]   nerve cells
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.440]   neurons
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.100]   communicate with
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.460]   each other
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:32.900]   and communicate
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.460]   with muscle
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.060]   by electricity
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.080]   but that
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.860]   electricity is
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.520]   generated by
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.760]   particular ions
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.740]   moving into
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.200]   and out of
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.640]   the neuron
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.460]   and the
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.680]   rushing in
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.020]   of a particular
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.580]   ion
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.220]   sodium
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.840]   salt
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.700]   is what
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.540]   allows nerve
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.300]   cells to fire
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.360]   if you don't
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:49.840]   have enough
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.820]   salt in your
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.180]   system
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.460]   your neurons
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.160]   and your brain
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.640]   and your nerve
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.180]   to muscle
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.720]   communication
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   will be
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.220]   terrible
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.940]   if you have
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.340]   sufficient
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:57.900]   salt
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.860]   it will be
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.300]   excellent
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.080]   how much
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.700]   salt will depend
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.120]   on how much
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.480]   water you're
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:01.780]   drinking
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.540]   how much
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:02.940]   caffeine
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.140]   you're
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.420]   drinking
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:03.780]   and how
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:03.940]   much
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.380]   food
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:04.660]   you're
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.180]   ingesting
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.400]   so and
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:06.640]   whether or
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:06.820]   not you're
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.260]   taking any
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:07.880]   diuretics
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.280]   how hot
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.580]   it is
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:08.860]   etc
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.200]   how much
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.340]   you're
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.620]   sweating
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.500]   so you
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.740]   want to
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:10.980]   make sure
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.180]   that you
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:11.520]   have enough
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:11.880]   salt
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.400]   potassium
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.100]   and magnesium
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.600]   in your
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:13.940]   system
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.340]   if you
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.580]   want to
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:14.840]   perform
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.160]   well
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.180]   the other
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.400]   thing
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.660]   that's
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.240]   been shown
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.660]   over and
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.180]   over again
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.780]   numerous
