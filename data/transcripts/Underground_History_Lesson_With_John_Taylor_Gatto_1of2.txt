[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:42.380]   He then launched a career of public speaking in the area of public school reform. He then began a worldwide public speaking and writing career and has received several awards from libertarian organizations including the Alexis de Tocqueville Award for Excellence in the Advancement of Educational Freedom in 1997. John has been invited to speak all around the world to share his research and has published a number of books. He has also been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature by the University of Chicago for his work in the field of literary writing.

Since his public resignation in 1991, he has traveled over 3 million air miles, spoken at Harvard University, NASA Space Center, the White House, Smith College, Cato Institute, and many other places. He has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conventions and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conventions and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conventions and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conventions and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conventions and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 state homeschool conferences and has also been a keynote speaker at over 30 states.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:25.140]   In his book, Weapons of Mass Instruction, here's how John defines open source education.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:35.620]   Open source learning accepts that everything under the sun might be a possible starting point on the road to self-mastery and a good life.

[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.480]   The main thesis of John's body of work can best be illustrated, in my opinion, by asking the question,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.820]   What do public schools actually teach children?
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:27.240]   And answering it with the main themes contained in John's first book, printed in 1992, titled Dumbing Us Down.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.340]   He makes the following observations about how public schools are designed in form and function.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.960]   Public schooling teaches confusion by breaking coherence.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.260]   It presents an ensemble of the same.

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:02.820]   So you described that individual beings, when in groups, kind of subvert their own individual thinking power. And the law of identity, none of us can change who we are, we have to be ourselves, and that is constant throughout life. So it's about figuring out how to remain individually self-reliant and self-sufficient as going through these systems that are trying to change us and to make us less self-reliant and more. Very much so. And I think the awareness of the individual being is so important.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:31.680]  , the awareness of these contrary dynamics is what gives rise to the theories of dialectic. I mean, Aristotle all the way through history, the variety of them, but they participate in the same way, is essentially asking you for your own self-defense, not to assume that what anyone says, especially when you're talking about the individual being, is not the same as the individual being.

[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:16.240]   to look at America between, let me roughly say,
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   1800 and 1865.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.320]   And then from momentum right up to the first world war,

[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   And it comes from everywhere. It's the way people saw the world around them. They saw the elements of raw material. They processed it a slightly different way. And then they had the expanse of the rhetorical capacity to say, "Hey, look, there's a better way to do this." It was happening so frequently that a crisis occurred in the United States.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.220]   And without understanding this crisis, you really can't understand why our schools are the product of the Rockefeller family, the Carnegie family, the Astor family, the Vanderbilt family, the great capitalist families.

[01:27:45.620 --> 01:28:14.800]  , I was told that over and over. His name is Francis Galton, a world-famous explorer, mathematician inventing little statistical formulae to discriminate shades of quality that the schools are infested with and he has Mr. Galton, a worldwide following of Galton's
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:44.000]   and he has Mr. Galton, a worldwide following of Galton's clubs including in the United States. He makes several pilgrimages to the US to spread the insight that a menace to the human race exists in 95% of the population and there has to be a way to put them, render them harmless.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:29:13.200]   and they have to be in the shoes of the men and women of the United States. They may be able to do it, but they will not be able to do it. That's the way to do it and we'll defend this with precise mathematical signs. We will keep to ourselves the biological reason.

[01:42:38.240 --> 01:43:07.720]   and partly because of laziness. I decided with my five classes a day to impose the same material on all five classes, the same quality of discourse make no differentiation at all. Certainly made my life easier. But what I had done was throw away the assigned curriculum,
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   which I believe is a very important part of the curriculum, which I believe is a very important part of the curriculum, which I believe is a very important part of the curriculum, which has been used by our students since I was a student at the University of Minnesota.
