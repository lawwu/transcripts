[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Well, sometimes on the podcast, we talk about textual matters.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240]   And Joe from Santa Barbara, California writes in, "Hello, Tony and Pastor
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.300]   John, Jude 9 and 14 to 15 confuse me.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.000]   Where is Jude getting the information from these verses?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.960]   Paul usually quotes the Old Testament and it tells us where he's quoting
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.800]   from at the bottom of our Bibles.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.600]   But I have no clue where Jude gets his quotations.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540]   I've asked others about these texts and they usually say something
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.520]   like Paul quoted pagan prophets.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.400]   But it seems to me that Jude is actually quoting scripture.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   What do we know and what do we not know about who Jude is citing here?"
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.620]   Well, here's what we know and what we don't know.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.620]   Jude is not quoting scripture.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.500]   That's pretty plain.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.600]   He doesn't claim to be quoting scripture, but we'll get to that in a minute.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.080]   Here's what we know and what we don't know.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.880]   We know that Jude was in the middle of rebuking some arrogant opponents in the
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.080]   church, and we know that in verse 9, he does this by contrasting their willingness
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.780]   to blaspheme what they don't understand with the Archangel Michael's unwillingness
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.680]   even to pronounce a blasphemous judgment against the devil.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.080]   So that's the point.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.600]   They're trying to rebuke their arrogance and presumption.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   And so he says in verse 9, it goes like this, "But when the Archangel Michael
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.880]   contending with the devil was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.120]   presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you.'
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.520]   But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand."
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   So we know that Jude refers to a situation at the burial of Moses where
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.720]   Michael, the Archangel, and the devil are disputing over what can be done with
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.760]   Moses' body.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.200]   And we know this is a story that's not in the Old Testament.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.160]   Nothing is said except that God took care of the burial up there in the mountain.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   Nobody knows where he was buried.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.840]   What we don't know for sure is exactly where the story comes from, according to
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.720]   verse 9.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.960]   There's more down lower in verses 14 and 15 that we do know, but here we don't
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.280]   know where it comes from.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   There is a Jewish book called The Assumption of Moses, written between the
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   Old and New Testaments, which has a story like this, but Jude doesn't seem to be
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   giving an exact quote.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680]   So we can't say for sure that's where he's getting it.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.520]   So the answer so far for verse 9 is we just don't know where he got that story.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.880]   But he got it from somewhere, and he doesn't make any claim to get it from
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Scripture.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.280]   Here's a further issue in verses 14 and 15.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.600]   Jude is still criticizing the ungodliness of his opponents, and this time he
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   actually quotes a source outside the Bible.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.080]   It doesn't say what it is.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.840]   At least it looks like a quote.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   Most people think it's a quote, namely from 1 Enoch.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.200]   This is a Jewish book written about 300 BC and not regarded as inspired or
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.520]   scriptural by Protestants or Catholics.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.440]   And it was not in the Old Testament that Jesus used and endorsed.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   Verses 14 and 15 are fairly close rendition of this verse.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.480]   That's why everybody thinks, most people think it's a quote.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.840]   These verses go like this.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.400]   "It was also these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied saying," so he's
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.120]   quoting now this prophecy that Enoch gives, "Behold, the Lord comes with 10,000
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.920]   of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.960]   all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.880]   and of all the harsh things that the ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.720]   So Jude quotes Enoch, the seventh from Adam, a seventh generation from Adam, as
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.880]   prophesying, and he turns his words against the opponents as a judgment on
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   them, and that's the judgment they can expect.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.800]   Now, here's the question.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.120]   What does this mean for Jude who cites this from outside the Bible?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.640]   Where did he get it?
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.440]   What's he doing?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.640]   Here are two possibilities.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.760]   One, he believed that even though these sources, first Enoch and wherever he got
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   the verse nine idea, the story, these sources, though not inspired, contain
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.600]   truth that he's willing to use.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.240]   That's one possibility.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.360]   A second possibility, and I kind of lean toward this one, but it's impossible to
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.080]   prove, namely that Jude knew that his opponents in the church, the people that
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.720]   he's so upset with, his opponents in the church loved to make use of first Enoch
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.760]   and maybe the assumption of Moses, these books, and they were their favorite books
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.480]   to use from, and so he's citing their own documents in an ironic way to bring them
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.440]   in a reverse way back on their own heads.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.040]   Now, that's where this issue about Paul quoting the poets becomes relevant,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.520]   because that's what Paul did when he quoted the poets in Acts 17 from the
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   pagan authors, he said, "God is actually not far from each one of us, for in him
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.480]   we live and move and have our being.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   Even some of your own poets have said this, for we are indeed his offspring.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:19.000]   Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think of the divine being as like gold
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.480]   or silver or stone or an image formed by the art or imagination of man."
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.800]   So Paul reached into sources that he didn't believe were inspired, saw something
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.000]   that was written there, drew it out, used it in a Christian way, and turned it back,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.600]   as it were, on his conversation partners there in Athens.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.480]   So even though we don't know for sure, my inclination is to say that Jude chose
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.520]   to cite these extra biblical sources because his adversaries put such a high
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.400]   premium on them, and then he turned them around and used them to indict
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.560]   the very pride that was using them.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.440]   Interesting.
