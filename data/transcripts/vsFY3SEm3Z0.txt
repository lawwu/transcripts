[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Pastor John, we get emails often from people who are essentially asking the
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   question, "Is there any hope for me? Is there any hope for me after I've sinned
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.960]   in a really stupid way and am now paying the price for my foolish choices?" What
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.520]   would you say to someone in that situation?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   Tony, Psalm 107 has been, over the years, a huge encouragement to me in my own
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.200]   wrestling with a sense of failure at times and wondering, "Is there a
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.560]   future for ministry or even of faith?" And probably as much as any other psalm,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.800]   Psalm 107 has been the one that has made it possible for me to reach out and
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.480]   rescue, I think, some folks who feel like there's just no hope for them. They've
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.000]   sinned too many times or they've sinned in too horrible a way for God to have
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   any future for them. So let me just share with you, or the folks that might be in
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.480]   that condition, what I meditated on yesterday. I was reading through the
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.080]   Psalms again and came to Psalm 107, which begins, "Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.200]   He is good, for His steadfast love endures forever." And that's the refrain
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   that comes again and again. The psalm ends, "Whoever is wise, let him attend to
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.120]   these things. Let them consider the steadfast love of the Lord." So it begins
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   and it ends with the steadfast love of the Lord. And then four times, there's
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.160]   these four stories or these four stanzas where it repeats, "They cried to the Lord
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.760]   in their trouble. He delivered them from their distress. Let them thank the Lord
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.280]   for His steadfast love, for His wondrous works to the children of men." So four
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.440]   times you read that very same pair of verses. But what makes it so amazingly
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.560]   encouraging is that the situations in which people cried out to God are the
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.160]   very kinds of situations that people get themselves into now and feel hopeless,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.840]   which is why this psalm is so hopeful. So here's one example. "Some sat in darkness
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.880]   and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and irons, for they had
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.720]   rebelled against the words of God and spurned His counsel." And I could just
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.800]   hear hundreds of people saying, "I've spurned God's counsel. I knew it was
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.440]   right and I threw it away." And that's exactly what these people are doing. And
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   so you tend to say, "Well, there's no hope for them." And the next thing you read is,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.960]   "They cried to the Lord in their trouble and He delivered them from all their
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   distress." Or another one was later on, it says, "Some were fools through sinful ways
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   because of their iniquities. They suffered affliction. They loathed any
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.120]   kind of food and they drew near to the gates of death." So these are people who,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.080]   because they've acted so stupidly, they've got AIDS. Or they've wrecked
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.000]   their minds with mind-altering drugs. Or they've gotten some kind of kidney
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.760]   failure because of excessive alcohol. Or their lungs are shot for 60 years of,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   you know, two packs of cigarettes every day and they feel like, "God owes me
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.720]   nothing. There's just no hope for me at all." And that's exactly these folks'
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.240]   situation. They don't even want to eat anymore. They're at the gates
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.600]   of death. They're in the midst of affliction because they've been fools.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.800]   And yet they cried to the Lord in their trouble. He delivered them from all
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   their distresses. And therefore, the hope that this psalm brings to people who
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.920]   feel like there's just no hope is incredible. You get to the end of the
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.480]   psalm and it says, "He turns rivers into a desert." That's bad. "And he turns desert
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.040]   into pools of water." That's good. Then it says, "He pours contempt on princes."
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.920]   That's bad. "And he raises up the needy from affliction." And I think the point is,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.200]   God is free to come down here and do whatever He has to do, whether it's hard
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   things or easy things, good things or bad things. God's going to do these things
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.280]   for the sake of lifting up the upright. So it ends with, "The upright see it and
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.160]   are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth. Whoever is wise," and this is what
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.480]   I'd say, Tony, to whoever's listening, "Whoever is wise, let him attend to these
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.320]   things. Let him consider the steadfast love of the Lord."
