[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   He implied, do you tell me if I got this wrong?
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.960]   He implied that in the modern era,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.100]   you need to be $10 billion to go public.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.940]   - Yeah.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.760]   - Market cap.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.600]   - Yes.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.680]   - Which, if it's 10 billion or bust, that's a bitch, man.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.140]   (both laugh)
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:29.880]   - Hey, man.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.700]   - What's going on, bruh?
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.540]   - It's good to be here.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.500]   It's like a destination podcast here in Santa Barbara.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.660]   - This is our first destination podcast.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.720]   We're coming to you live
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   from CO2's East Meets West 2024 conference.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.560]   - Indeed.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   Were you up or down last night?
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.520]   - I did okay.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.340]   - Okay, okay.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.180]   - Hey, you.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.520]   - Ah, it was a good night.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.360]   - Yeah.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.180]   - It was a good night.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.000]   - Hopefully they don't think we were the ringers,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.240]   you know, at the time.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.400]   - Well, tell the audience a little bit
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.160]   about what is East Meets West.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040]   It's a really gracious invitation.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.880]   - Yeah.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.700]   - You know, we've been doing this for years
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.920]   with CO2 down here.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.760]   - Yeah.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.600]   - Why don't you tell us a little bit about it?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.640]   - Yeah, so Philippe and Thomas Lafont,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.920]   who run CO2, started a conference,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880]   I'm gonna guess about eight or nine years ago,
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.700]   titled East Meets West, and at the time,
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.480]   it was really about bringing together entrepreneurs
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   from Silicon Valley and the West
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960]   with entrepreneurs from China.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.700]   And some of my best relationships
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.740]   with some of the smartest, coolest,
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.020]   hippest Chinese entrepreneurs came here,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.140]   and the access was just unbelievable.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.980]   - Yeah.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.500]   - It's literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.020]   and they've kept the conference up.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.180]   It's on my list of must-attends.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.020]   - Yeah.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.440]   - You get a combination of incredible founders,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.660]   some great CEOs, Satya Nadella's here,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.500]   Dara's here, Andrew from EA is here,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.140]   and it's one of those conferences,
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.820]   like when I entered the industry years ago at Agenda,
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.920]   the Agenda Conference, which Stuart Alsop ran,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.220]   you know, Larry Ellison and Bill Gates
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.100]   and Scott McNeely would stay through the conference,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.980]   so they're around. - Incredible.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.920]   - Today, most conferences, the keynotes come in and go out.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.340]   Here, everyone stays, and so it's more intimate,
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.620]   you learn more, you get to talk to more people,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.700]   they do a lot of these one-on-ones,
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.980]   where they set it up so that you can maximize
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.540]   an individual connection, it's just incredible.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.080]   Anyway, I'm super thankful to them for having us down
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   and for letting us do this here.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.580]   - It's a big investment, it's a big investment by them,
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.540]   and I think one of the things that's underappreciated
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.740]   outside of Silicon Valley is there's this view
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.500]   that this is all zero-sum, right?
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.580]   That I win, you lose, you know, we're all very competitive,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.300]   we all like to win, whether we're playing poker,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.640]   whether we're playing hoops, whether we're doing this,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.660]   but really, I think this is a demonstration
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.900]   of positive sum.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.620]   The fact of the matter is we're all analysts,
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.700]   we're trying to figure out the future,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.480]   and what I deeply appreciate, you know, with you,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.500]   with the guys at All In, when you come to an event like this,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.120]   it's a lot of conversation about this future,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.400]   about the consequence on the economy.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.260]   We're gonna be talking to Larry Summers tonight
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.420]   about, you know, about that question,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.540]   about the consequence on society from AI,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.700]   which we're gonna be talking about a little bit today.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.540]   You know, but when you really telescope out
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.420]   over the last 20 years that you and I have been doing this,
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.040]   technology's gone from 5% to 15% of global GDP, right?
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   And we're gonna talk about public markets
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.860]   and venture markets, but the reality is
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.100]   there's a very big pie, you know,
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460]   and we can all participate in that together.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.700]   And so, you know, to me, this is a reflection.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.540]   I see a lot of old friends, you know,
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.480]   this place is full of GPs, it's full of venture capitalists.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.980]   You know, a lot of people would think of Altimeter
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.500]   as a competitor to Kotu, but the fact of the matter
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.660]   is you and I collaborate with them on a ton of stuff.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.580]   Some of it works, some of it doesn't work,
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.980]   but we trust each other.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.040]   We have a shorthand with one another.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.540]   So it's great to be back down here.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.260]   And like I said, thanks to, you know,
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.980]   Philippe and Thomas for encouraging us
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.020]   to do the pod down here.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.660]   I think it's a perfect setting.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.300]   But, you know, I thought one of the things we could do
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.600]   is set up for people, like what goes on here,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.740]   and just kind of take them through it a little bit, right?
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.560]   Sounds great.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.300]   So as you said, there's a couple hundred founders,
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.420]   CEOs, and GPs.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.740]   You know, the first morning, which was this morning,
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.540]   we always telescope out, and Philippe kind of takes us
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.660]   through, you know, the view of the public markets,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.620]   if you will.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.660]   And then Thomas takes us through this view
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.780]   of the venture markets.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.940]   And so maybe we could just start-
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.660]   And just to give you in a sense, like, I mean,
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.020]   it's a presentation I look forward to every year.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.060]   And I think they said they threw out a hundred slides.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.780]   So they put, they didn't, it's not falling off a log.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.500]   They're putting in an immense amount of work
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.460]   to put this together.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   And by the time this podcast is released,
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.420]   I believe their PowerPoints will be released.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.460]   Perhaps people can follow along
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.980]   as we talk about what happened.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.260]   You know, they captured a little of that zeitgeist.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.940]   Remember the old Meeker slides?
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.780]   Yes.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.620]   You know, that everybody, you know,
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.980]   waited to see Mary's slides.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.580]   And I think they do a lot of really great content.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.340]   And Daniel also, you know, they gave thanks to him
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.440]   and his team for putting these things together.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.740]   So a lot of great content, but they started, you know,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.940]   I always like to get a read on where they are,
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.100]   both as, you know, we're co-conspirators
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.100]   in the public markets and the public markets
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.540]   really set the stage for the venture markets.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.940]   And he said, you know, his first slide, you know,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.780]   he put up this slide.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.660]   He said, two big questions in 2024.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.340]   Number one, are we in an AI bubble in the public markets?
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.380]   And then number two, we talked about last week,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.280]   is software dead, okay?
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.240]   And what was interesting is we do these live polls.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.120]   So I don't know, there may be 100, 150 seats out here.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.320]   We do these live polls.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.680]   They flashed up the poll we did this time last year.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.440]   And this time last year, 56% of people here
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.560]   said we're in an AI bubble in the public markets.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.940]   Remember, Nvidia had gone from $120 a share,
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.920]   maybe at that time to $250 a share.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.680]   And people were already saying we're in a bubble.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   Now since then, Nvidia is up 200%, okay?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.560]   And I was watching CNBC this morning.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.320]   So far this year, Nvidia is responsible
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.480]   for 5% of the S&P 500 returns.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.160]   The other mag six are responsible for 5%.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.560]   And then the other 493 companies in the S&P 500
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.120]   are responsible for 4% of the 14% year to date returns.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.480]   If you looked at the S&P equal weighted, okay?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.720]   So you just, everybody's in at the same amount.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   It's only up 4% this year.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.120]   So that all led, I think, Philippe to say,
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.320]   you know, we've got three $3 trillion companies now.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.520]   Is this sustainable?
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.720]   Are we in a bubble?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.280]   What was surprising to me was knowing Philippe
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.080]   the way we do is he showed a slide
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.720]   of the earnings growth of Nvidia, right?
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   Comparing it to Cisco from the '99, 2000 period.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.080]   In the case of Cisco, the earnings multiple
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.720]   more than tripled during that period of time.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.700]   But in this case, because of the earnings growth of Nvidia,
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.500]   the earnings multiple has been flat,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.880]   despite the fact that the stock is up nearly 10X.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.200]   So he seemed to suggest, Bill,
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.360]   that we're not in an AI bubble.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.960]   In fact, he showed an S curve saying KOTU's view
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.400]   is that it's going to be even bigger
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.200]   than people currently think.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   Was that convincing to you?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.360]   Because I know you've been a voice of pragmatism.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.760]   - Certainly at the end of his presentation,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.280]   it was hard not to believe.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.460]   I felt a little bit like I was at church.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.240]   And he went on to say, I believe that,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.400]   and I think they were somewhat liberal
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.820]   in tagging AI companies,
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.980]   but they said AI companies were responsible
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.640]   for 90% of the gains in the public markets.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.560]   I think they're including some energy stocks
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.920]   that have traded up as a result of this.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   But yeah, he pointed out that if you go to the past
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.320]   and start to notice one to three companies
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.880]   just materially blowing out numbers
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   above everyone's estimates over several quarters,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.000]   there may be something happening
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.880]   that you should pay attention to,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.800]   which is a valid argument, right?
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.480]   - And listen, I love the self-deprecating nature.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   He says in 2022, it was all about macro.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.920]   What's happening with inflation?
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.480]   What's happening with interest rates, right?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.280]   Macro dominated 2022.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.600]   We get chad GPT at the end of '22, okay?
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.520]   And we enter 2023.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.640]   And so you have this post-traumatic stress.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.500]   And he's saying that post-traumatic stress
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.200]   kept a lot of people out of the market
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   despite all of our suspicion
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.040]   that this was an important phase shift.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.160]   2023, you have this liftoff.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.840]   And what has happened is as more cards got turned over,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.380]   by the end of the presentation,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.720]   he said macro is shifted to the backseat, right?
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.440]   That now he's kind of in the camp.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.840]   - Which I found a huge relief
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.280]   'cause you know I don't like to talk about it.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.120]   - So macro shifted to the backseat from his perspective
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.080]   that we're kind of headed toward
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.640]   this no landing, soft landing,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.340]   that maybe inflation really was an anomaly
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.000]   of the COVID period.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And if that's the case, then this new super cycle,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.860]   which again, they described as transforming
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.620]   all these different parts of society is allowed to shine.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.920]   And so that to me was a significant change,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.100]   I think by CO2 in terms of the positioning of those two.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.000]   - I'd add one thing to it, just from dinner last night.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.020]   I get to see people that I may only see
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.220]   once or twice a year.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.740]   They might be executives at some of the Mag 7
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.980]   or other VCs at other firms.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.460]   And one thing that was congruent across them all
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.180]   is they all feel a bit like a kid in a candy store with AI.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.460]   It's like there's a new toy to go play with.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.460]   And I think from an intellectual curiosity standpoint,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.300]   like I see smiles and excitement.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.860]   And like, so it's clear to me
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.120]   that the vast majority of people here,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.780]   not just the team at CO2 believes this is a mega wave
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.420]   that everyone's gotta be all in on.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.300]   - Yeah, that is, I mean, I think if there's one surprise,
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.340]   one answer on that, I'd love to get your reaction to.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.540]   So on the question of how much would it,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.780]   and I hear this 200 billion of CapEx
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.180]   going into the ground this year,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.740]   how much return do companies need to see?
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.340]   So we had Satya present to us one answer.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.060]   We had Philippe give us another answer today.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.200]   Philippe, what he called his monkey math
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.100]   was that it was gonna take $1.8 trillion
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.360]   in order to provide a 25% return on investing capital, okay?
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   And of that 1.8 trillion, he went and said,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.580]   if we got a 5% improvement in the labor force, right?
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.360]   So I think what he was saying is we effectively take 5%
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.020]   out of the labor force,
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.840]   that that would be enough cost savings
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.740]   to justify the $200 billion investment.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.660]   Satya tackled it from a slightly different way,
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.300]   just here talking at lunch.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.760]   He said, if we currently have a global GDP
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.220]   growing at 1% to 2%,
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.820]   he said, if we could get that up to 3% to 4%,
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.480]   the incremental gain coming from that
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.680]   would be enough to compensate again for this,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.860]   because it would more than double
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.540]   the amount of money spent on technology.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.100]   Convincing or not convincing?
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.700]   Seems like it answers the question for-
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.820]   The Satya, I buy more than the first one.
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.060]   The problem I have with the first one
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.060]   is simply that my entire time in technology,
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.100]   like these tools are competitive weapons,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.840]   but if I get armed with them
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.780]   and my competitor gets armed with them,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.820]   it doesn't necessarily increase,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.420]   it doesn't create like free net income.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.220]   You might die if you don't do it,
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.380]   but you gotta keep, it's the Red Queen effect.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.260]   You gotta keep running just to keep up.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.020]   Yes, so capitalism ultimately competes away margin.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.340]   Yeah, down at the level of-
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.180]   Benefits humans.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I buy the GDP argument better.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.380]   Right, right.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.980]   But anyway, look, the other thing that I would say
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.060]   that reinforces the super cycle
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.100]   is now that all the VCs are convinced
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.700]   and all the big tech companies are convinced,
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.120]   they're all plowing money into LLM research.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.900]   Now, LLM might not be the best tool for every problem,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.380]   but we're gonna find out,
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.460]   we're sure gonna find out all edge cases possible,
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.100]   'cause they're gonna stack stuff on top of it,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.020]   they're gonna prop it up, we're gonna go try.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.500]   I should include the CIOs.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.100]   I think all the CIOs are doing this.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.020]   One thing he did mention was software stocks are down,
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.500]   and I do think that this wave is being promoted
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.260]   at such a level that it sucks air from other things.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.180]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.100]   At the CIO level, at the purchasing level,
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.460]   even at just the attention of the buy side level.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.500]   Yes, I think it's important to point out
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.060]   that I think both Philippe and Satya believe,
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.420]   Satya even talked about it, he said,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.340]   we have to prepare the company
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.900]   that there's gonna be a mismatch in timing here
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.620]   between investment and return.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.260]   These are nonlinear events,
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.940]   and just like we saw on the internet,
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.820]   you may go like this, draw down 30%
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.980]   on your way to a higher high,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.580]   but I think from an investment perspective,
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.820]   whether you're a venture capitalist
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.600]   or whether you're a public market investor,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.840]   or whether you're a founder,
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.100]   one of the founders in the audience,
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.860]   you have to assume that there is going to be an AI winter
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.940]   at some point in time,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.420]   that zone of disillusionment
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.180]   you and I have talked about before,
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.340]   that doesn't mean that it's not going to be bigger
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.420]   than we all think,
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.580]   but it does mean that resilience through that period
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.540]   is gonna be really important.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.100]   If you run out of money during that period, it's all over.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.260]   Yeah, and Satya made me think of something
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.900]   that I hadn't really considered before,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.200]   but because all AI tools are being delivered
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.020]   as a service in the cloud,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.740]   there's just a massive amount of CapEx happening.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.580]   And if you go back to the internet wave,
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.620]   people were buying Cisco products,
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.620]   maybe WorldCom was putting CapEx into the ground,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.460]   Equinix was putting CapEx into the ground,
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.460]   but it wasn't like Microsoft or Netscape or whoever,
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.180]   the Yahoo, they weren't really plowing this into the ground.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.240]   And I think the risk of the type of things
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.180]   that could happen with a reset are higher
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.420]   when you're putting all this into the ground.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.660]   And Satya very quickly said, this is a supply-driven wave.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.380]   And I think up to date, that is true.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.660]   We're building ahead of demand.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.980]   A lot of the startups and CIOs
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.660]   qualify the current AI work as experimental.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.660]   Not all of it, I mean, the coding stuff,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.500]   we've been through this.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.140]   There's a lot of it that's real,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.920]   but some of it's still experimental.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.580]   So if there were any hesitancy or whatever,
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.400]   or if we get this, if we build too much CapEx or whatever,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.100]   it could be, there could be costs.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.500]   Back to the GDP thing,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.700]   I thought it was really interesting.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.500]   Satya said, think about how a global company had to do,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.900]   simply had to do their annual planning,
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   pre-personal computer, pre-spreadsheet, pre-internet,
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.580]   and it's no wonder that massive productivity
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.860]   was unleashed in the '80s and '90s.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.500]   I mean, the productivity gains in the '90s were so great
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.100]   that the US government ran a surplus, if you remember,
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.060]   at the end of the '90s. - I don't remember that.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.140]   - You don't remember it because it lasted about 10 seconds?
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.220]   - Well, also because Clinton cut taxes in front of her,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   and the market was up 30% a year.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.700]   - Sure, sure, but the productivity gains
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.780]   to come out of that are undeniable.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.020]   And I think there's reason to believe
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.300]   that the productivity gains we're gonna see here
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.440]   are at least as big.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.300]   I think that's what these folks
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.900]   who are making these investments believe.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.240]   But it was interesting that Satya said,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.260]   here we are, I'm a software business,
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.940]   and I'm investing more in CapEx than industrial companies.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.780]   And he spent a lot of time talking about
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.540]   what it meant to be a lean operator
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.860]   when you're investing at that level of CapEx.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.820]   - 50 billion a year, I think. - Right.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.740]   - Yeah, that's a lot.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.860]   - One other thing that Philippe said
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.420]   that really caught my eye,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.100]   and maybe he was trying to be provocative,
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.740]   but he implied, you tell me if I got this wrong,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.420]   he implied that in the modern era,
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.540]   you need to be $10 billion to go public.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.020]   - Yeah. - Market cap.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.860]   - Yes.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.140]   - Which, if it's 10 billion or bust, that's a big man.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.660]   - Well, so let's dig into that.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.020]   I mean, we went through the public market stuff.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.540]   I think the punchline at the end of it
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.980]   was the market's up a lot in '23 and '24.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.460]   You know, we haven't, multiples have not expanded that much,
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.020]   but it does assume that revenue continues to grow.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.820]   - Right, he said NVIDIA is not expensive
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.820]   on an earnings basis.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.100]   So if it's gonna miss, it's because either revenue growth's
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.700]   gonna stop or margins collapse in price.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.620]   - And the second, you know, it seemed to be that they were,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.660]   we suggested last week that smart money
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.420]   was beginning to nibble on software,
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.060]   that software is not dead.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.520]   You know, he seemed to suggest it's just the last thing
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.660]   to benefit from AI.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.700]   And so I've talked to a bunch of folks here,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.620]   and I would say the number one thing
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.780]   that I hear people buying are not the semis stocks
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.860]   that have worked so well over the course of last year,
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.340]   but everybody's interested in buying software
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.720]   at five and a half times revenue, forward revenue,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.020]   which is, as we've said, 20% below the 10-year average.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.140]   They may be early, but I think people are really interested.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.800]   They don't think software's dead,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.780]   and they think that, you know,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.300]   software starts to look interesting.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.080]   - I think there's a, we'd have to dig in it later,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.400]   but I think there are certain types of software companies
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.460]   that people think are more under threat
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.700]   from LLM's more workflow than who's the data repository.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.460]   There's questions about, you know,
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.460]   whether LLM's replace queries
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.060]   and who sits in the stack where.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.260]   So, and there are some people that still take,
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.040]   you know, I view the width of what people are willing
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.940]   to believe about AI is really wide.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.580]   And the skeptics are like LLM's are topping out,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.980]   but the people on the opposite end are like,
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.380]   oh, this is just gonna replace all the software I have.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.100]   - Right, and the truth is probably in the middle.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.940]   - I think it's probably.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.240]   - And like, as analysts, our job is to figure out,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.860]   you know, exactly where that is.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.860]   So you started to reference, you know,
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.580]   after we did the deep dive this morning on public markets,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.180]   then we talked about venture markets.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.900]   You know, Thomas took us through that.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.260]   And, you know, I'll lead up to the conversation on IPOs,
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.660]   which I think is really interesting.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.940]   We've talked a lot,
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   but he basically started by saying VC is normalizing.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.000]   You know, if you look at 2021, he showed a slide,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.500]   we had 715 billion of venture
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.220]   that went into the ground in 2021.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.740]   We've talked a fair bit about that.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.140]   This year, they're forecasting about 250 billion
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.940]   into the ground into venture.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.200]   So that's about one third of the levels we were in 2024.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.040]   However.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.900]   - I think venture as they measure it
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   has become to mean non-PE private investment.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.720]   - Correct, correct.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.380]   I think it's all technology investing that's not public
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.220]   and that's not private equity.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.420]   And then they looked at the cul-de-sac of AI.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.580]   Year to date, I think 200 deals, 22 billion of investment.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.980]   Average valuation, wait for it, $1 billion, right?
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.340]   Average round size, 120 million.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.940]   - Yeah, the round size and the valuation were five to six X,
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.860]   the non-AI company.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.700]   - Correct.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.180]   - Five to six X.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.260]   - And that was, I thought what was so interesting
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.360]   about the way they teed up the presentation on venture,
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.580]   right, was he then took us through
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.940]   almost a bit of admonishment for some,
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.460]   or at least encouragement, strong encouragement
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.720]   for the founders in the crowd that may have raised money
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.660]   between 2020 and 2022.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.540]   He took, here's a slide where he said,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.260]   outside of the AI unicorns,
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:34.260]   the other 1,400 unicorns are not raising any money, right?
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.940]   And he said, there's too many competing opportunities
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.740]   in the public market, risk-free rate of 5%.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.580]   - Bitcoin.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.140]   - Yeah, Bitcoin said we still have too many unicorns
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.380]   at 1,400.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.060]   Here, he showed a slide of the LinkedIn employee growth
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.060]   within those 1,400 unicorns has gone from 75% to 10%.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.100]   And that the revenue growth
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.140]   has also decelerated dramatically.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.740]   Now you and I have been talking about this.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.860]   - No left axis on that one, but down and to the right.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.500]   - And shockingly, IPOs in 2024,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.940]   2021 through 2024 are fewer
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.460]   than during the great financial crisis in 2008.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.860]   - No IPOs, 1,400 private unicorns,
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.700]   most of which have not had a funding round since,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.620]   the majority of which, and he has a slide on that,
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.900]   have not had a funding round since this quote reset in 2023.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.640]   And so maybe haven't faced the,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.500]   taken their medicine as to what their reevaluation is.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.940]   And then he showed a slide that where they,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.220]   I don't know how they, maybe it was in their own portfolio,
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.860]   but where secondaries are happening
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.940]   and they're happening at the exact same multiple
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.100]   as the public companies.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.940]   And so-
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.680]   - So just to put it,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.260]   the secondary sales in the venture market
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.540]   are 50 to 75% off the highs,
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.340]   just like the public markets retrace 50 to 70.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.740]   - The non-MAX 7 companies that are public, correct.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.080]   And so I do think,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.340]   I often hear people on a board say something like,
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.340]   well, good thing we didn't go public
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.500]   or good thing we aren't public.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.340]   - Exactly.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.760]   - But they're sitting on the board of a private company
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.340]   that's at 150 million in revenue and growing 10%.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.180]   - Right, right.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.740]   - Like you just have your head in a hole in the ground,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.260]   like an ostrich, you're not better off.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.100]   The only one reason you might be better off,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.700]   you might be able to persuade your employees
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.020]   that things aren't as bad.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.940]   Whereas if you were public, you're looking at a $4 stock.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.700]   - I could actually say, Bill, that you're worse off.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.980]   And here's the argument for why you're worse off.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.220]   I mean, when the public markets gives you a sign, right?
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.020]   Like it did Meta or Facebook in the fall of 2022
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.600]   when the stock goes to $90 a share, right?
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.040]   There's nowhere to hide.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.200]   You confront the brutal truth.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.680]   You confront the reality.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.600]   Public market investors,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.640]   it's the collective wisdom of that crowd.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   And I think it motivates the company
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.920]   to do the things they should do.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.600]   And they do them faster than they would otherwise do.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.040]   And Zuckerberg led the charge on this
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.220]   and his stock has quintupled since that moment.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.360]   - I could not agree more.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.220]   And so I just, I see, you know, the irony there
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.660]   is you have a company that went from 86,000 employees
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.680]   to 69,000 employees at a faster rate
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.560]   than I've watched most of these private unicorns move.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.540]   You know, the private unicorns hid in the cocoon
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.500]   of the fact that they didn't have to get marked daily.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.700]   And that's why I would, you know,
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.140]   I really don't like the stay private forever idea.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.660]   It works for some companies
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.960]   where you have an Elon Musk running SpaceX
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.180]   and you know the intrinsic motivation
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.540]   and the experience will lead to a good outcome.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.620]   It doesn't work well for 1,350, bless you,
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.980]   of the other unicorns that are out there.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.300]   - Yeah, and to play devil's advocate,
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.220]   I think some people are gonna make the argument
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.880]   that you don't wanna be a micro-cap public company
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.540]   and that no one will pay attention to you
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.500]   and no one will cover you.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.260]   I still say, like, if you're liquid, you know,
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.140]   that's better off.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.500]   You've converted away your LikPref stack,
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.340]   that's better off.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.380]   - You want me to tell you why I don't believe that?
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.220]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.040]   - Yeah.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.980]   - Because investors are greedy.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.820]   - Right.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.980]   - Greedy investors will find you
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.100]   if your company is growing really fast
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.060]   and has great margins.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.780]   Look at Samsara, okay?
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.520]   Samsara went public and everybody said too small,
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.780]   not enough coverage, stock's not working.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.140]   That company has been a grand slam home run
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.100]   in the public markets, okay?
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.780]   The fact of the matter is if you're only growing 10%
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.180]   and you're marginally profitable or not profitable,
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.980]   I don't care if you're in the venture markets
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.020]   or you're in the public markets,
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.640]   you gotta fix your business model
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.980]   'cause that's never going to fetch a big multiple.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.820]   But let's get to the question on the table, IPOs, okay?
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.320]   So what to do about it, what to do about it, you know?
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.220]   And I think there's this question
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.060]   that we've debated amongst ourselves, with our friends,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.800]   with Thomas and Philippe about how big you need to be.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.700]   I think he was speaking at a conference in New York
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.140]   and he reiterated it here.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.240]   He thought you needed to be $10 billion, okay,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.940]   in total market cap in order to go public, okay?
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.780]   You've been at this for 25 years.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.900]   Tell me, tell us your response to this question
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.740]   of whether or not, because that implies
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.740]   if you're a software company,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.420]   you need to have like a billion in revenue to go public.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.380]   Do you think that's true?
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.900]   Well, I don't, but let me take a quick aside
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.660]   and let's say that is true.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:36.140]   If you have to be at a billion in revenue and growing,
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.180]   like if you want a 10X multiple, you gotta be growing 30.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.980]   Yes, 30%.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.480]   And if every company is gonna raise
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.560]   500 million to a billion dollars,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.620]   and if that's the only way they succeed,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.320]   if they get to that level,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.960]   this game just got a lot harder.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   Like this is massive risk on,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.560]   and I even wonder if part of the reason
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.240]   that you have this 1,400 sitting there
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.880]   is we forced so much capital on these companies
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.460]   that they had to grow up so fast
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.080]   and they had to do things that weren't kind of the normal way
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.920]   that you would grow a company, right?
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.440]   Where you stay close to the unit economics
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.800]   and you learn as you go.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.080]   Like if you have to just be all,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.200]   and we talked about it last week,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.320]   there's four companies in the coding AI space
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.380]   that have raised over 400 million each.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.600]   You think there'll be another round behind that?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.820]   Like they're all gonna pull out the huge guns
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.440]   and point them at one another,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.600]   and you're gonna execute in a way that's more risk on.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.000]   And so if that's the new world order,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   it's a form of capital competition and gamesmanship
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.720]   that is much different from classic venture capital.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.160]   I hope it's not true, but if it is,
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.200]   this is a different game.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.400]   Yeah, I mean, listen.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.440]   It's like heavyweight fighting.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.840]   I think it's a good provocation.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.320]   Thomas presented other paths to liquidity,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   M&A, PE partnerships, he put up on the screen.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.840]   But here's what I see, okay?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   We've recently sold two companies in our portfolio.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.640]   One was reported by the Wall Street Journal
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.800]   for a billion to $2 billion to Databricks called Tabular.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.720]   We have companies that have gotten fit
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.160]   and that are reaccelerating their growth rates.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.080]   And then we have two companies in the IPO pipeline, right?
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.000]   Like, I just think this has taken longer
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.440]   than any of us think.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.120]   Out of that 1,400, I suspect that 60 to 70%
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.600]   of those companies are never going to go public, okay?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.380]   So these are companies that are either gonna have
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.560]   to get sold off, they pass the peak
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.680]   in terms of their growth rates.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.120]   They don't have enough revenue scale in order to get public.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.240]   But I think that there are gonna be 30 to 40%
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.400]   of those that certainly could get public.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.720]   They may have to accept, like Instacart did.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.480]   By the way, look at Instacart.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.360]   They accepted a big down round
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.560]   from their last private round.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.000]   They went public.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.520]   The stock traded down, didn't trade that well.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.700]   And I think the stock is up well over 50% now
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.080]   because they've executed in the public markets.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.000]   And so I can't reinforce enough.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.520]   Amazon, since they went public,
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.040]   I think they've had four periods
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.160]   where they were down over 60%.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.000]   I understand.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.840]   And so-
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.320]   And a company I mentioned from the previous wave,
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.640]   Equinix, went from 200 down to two.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.280]   And today is at 778 and an $80 billion market cap.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   So it can happen.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.480]   I thought we would see way more IPOs.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.120]   I thought people would come public
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.160]   to two kind of clues to their cap chart
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.600]   and wipe out the LICPRA.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.020]   Maybe we still will.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.320]   I would encourage the regulators to do anything they can
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.600]   to make sure we don't have a systematic problem
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.000]   that's causing being public to be too expensive.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.880]   And I know that the reality we talked about
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.240]   on the last podcast, if that comes to be true,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.680]   where just way fewer companies go public
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.260]   and all the growth is in the private markets,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.040]   that the Gensler types are gonna come out and say,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.920]   "That's bad for the retail investor
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.240]   and they're gonna wanna fix it."
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.360]   I hope the way they try and fix it
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.800]   is to look through the cost of being public,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.580]   all the cost of being public and say,
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.400]   "What can we do as regulators to improve that situation?"
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.240]   That's what I hope.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.960]   The second thing I would like to do on this podcast,
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.080]   assuming that we have a really good set
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.440]   of listeners out there,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.700]   if there is a banker out there
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.360]   that thinks like the four horsemen did,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.680]   who says, "I don't need you to be 10 billion to go public.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.520]   I would love to take you public at 100 million in revenue.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.160]   Come see me, call me.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.080]   I will connect you to companies.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.920]   I will promote you."
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.440]   We need someone willing to do that.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.240]   I get the sense that the three big guys,
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.640]   JP Morgan Morgan and Goldman,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.440]   just aren't that interested, you know?
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.200]   And so I do think some percentage
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.040]   of the 1,400 should go public.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.820]   And I don't think that waiting is helping them at all.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.760]   And so I'd love to help find the people
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.640]   that can be their stewards.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.040]   Let me crystallize a question for you, okay?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.800]   So it was rumored last week that OpenAI
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.320]   is run rating three and a half, $4 billion in revenue,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.900]   which is, you and I, it's extraordinary, right?
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.920]   And I think it's pretty evenly split
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.160]   between a consumer business and an enterprise business.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.720]   I think that's even more extraordinary.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.960]   I have some potential data on that.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.560]   And on top of that,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.120]   I think that that team, right through the teeth
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.640]   of so much noise in the market, right?
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.480]   Like has withstood incredible turbulence.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.320]   They have.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.880]   To execute the way they have, okay?
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.840]   Faster than any other company I've ever seen,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.880]   delivering great products in the market, right?
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.000]   They have Greg Brockman in the basement,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.060]   churning out product no matter what happens
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.140]   in that business.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.680]   They have the big announcement at WWDC at Apple last week,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.040]   which I think was, you know,
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.520]   another master class in deal making
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.000]   and brand building by Sam and team, okay?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.440]   So you got $4 billion in revenue.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.680]   You're growing well over 100% a year.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.360]   You just marked it up a little bit, but.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.320]   Three and a half billion, whatever you want.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.660]   Whatever you want to call it.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.120]   Would you go public if you were,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.200]   if you could do a conversion to a for-profit company,
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.560]   would you take OpenAI public?
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.480]   There's a lot in that second part.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.800]   By the way, just to fill in some of this,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.240]   and I could be wrong on my math,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.200]   but I went into one of these credit card survey things
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.100]   and I looked at OpenAI and assuming
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.900]   that people don't pay for the API with a credit card,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.440]   so the credit card pool just represents,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.660]   and I compared it to a company where I knew the revenue,
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.620]   it would imply that there are about 2.1 of the three, four
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.820]   is the consumer business at $20 a pop.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.740]   So two thirds, the consumer business.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.960]   Put me in it and I love it.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.620]   Well, there's one other thing that I could look at
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.660]   in the credit card data,
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.060]   at least for the cohorts that are old enough,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.340]   the churn's about 65% annually.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.160]   So they're only 35% retaining,
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.460]   which Sachs had hinted at on all in,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.660]   and maybe the reason that I think Sam at one point
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.460]   said he didn't really see the $20 thing as his future.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.540]   Right, right.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.540]   But would I encourage them to go public?
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.860]   Well, they just hired a very reputable CFO,
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.340]   so maybe they're thinking about it.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.380]   The reason I think they would do it is if they,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.180]   first of all, they're very good at self-promotion
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.140]   and they're very good at promoting the company.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.220]   They're very good at enterprise sales.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.720]   They've convinced Apple, but many, many others.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.420]   And so if they thought they'd get a premium multiple
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.020]   and could get out there and have access to capital
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.860]   at a much cheaper price and liquidity for the employees,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.700]   which are now having to arrange, I could see it.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   I fear that the kind of current wisdom
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.300]   of the entrepreneurs to not do it.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.620]   Right, well, this is my,
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.820]   we have an opportunity to make a case to Sam and to Sacha.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.140]   And here's a bit of the case that I would make for him.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.380]   Number one, I think this is, you know, when you build AI,
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.960]   I think it's gonna be about trust and safety.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.300]   And I think being a public company, right,
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.600]   being exposed to public disclosures,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.740]   the scrutiny of the SEC, all the things that come with that
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.580]   from public market investors, you know,
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.280]   I think is a good thing for that business.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.380]   I think it would force them to tighten everything up.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.460]   No, I'm not talking today, but if I were on that board,
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.240]   you know, and maybe we'll tell this to Larry tonight,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.420]   I would say, you know,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.180]   let's start moving the company in a direction
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.420]   as though we were public, right?
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.860]   Let's do the conversion to a for-profit business.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.700]   Enough of this funky--
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.940]   By the way, I don't think that's trivial.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.180]   I agree, I'm just telling you, like, it's doable.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.740]   And the second thing I would say--
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.380]   I think it's only doable by putting a significant chunk
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.860]   of the company in the non.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.700]   Yes.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.380]   Like a share base in the nonprofit,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.420]   not this thing where they get it at the end.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.700]   And by the way, you can't take public that structure.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.940]   So here's what I don't like.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.740]   I don't like the idea that you could have a company
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.420]   that could theoretically go to a trillion dollars
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.780]   in enterprise value,
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.340]   could theoretically develop AGI,
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.860]   and a retail investor never has a shot
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.260]   to invest in that company.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.380]   I just don't think that's good
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.660]   for the structure of our markets.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.140]   I think it's better for the company.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.740]   I think it's better for the markets.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.500]   And frankly, I think it solves
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.620]   one of Microsoft's problems as well.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.380]   And we've seen all of the corporate, you know,
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.140]   some of the chaos around this business.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.340]   I actually think it would be good for Sam and Greg
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.420]   and Brad and team, right, to do that.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.500]   Now, of course, you got to put it on a path.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.460]   This probably takes a couple of years to get there.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.100]   But I mean, to me, that is the iconic question.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.900]   If 4 billion isn't enough, Bill, you know,
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.620]   with a $90 billion private market valuation, then what is?
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.780]   And I just don't think it's gonna be looked on that well.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.500]   If all of a sudden, all the best companies in the world,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.180]   right, are only available to the folks at this conference
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.460]   and not available to Wall Street.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.260]   - And they may wanna do acquisitions
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.020]   and getting the cap chart in a more traditional state
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.180]   would make that easier, public or private.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.300]   So maybe we'll see that happen.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.380]   I do think that the thing that may help us
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.020]   unlock this IPO problem, if you will,
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.140]   is a couple of AI companies going out.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:56.980]   - Yeah.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.380]   - And maybe that will even make it easier on the others
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.580]   just so that we start to prime the pump a little bit.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.980]   So I think you'll start to hear chatter
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.340]   on who are gonna be the first, you know,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.700]   AI first companies to go public.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.180]   There's rumors out there about Corweave.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.580]   There's articles about Cerebris.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.540]   So it would be interesting to see.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.580]   I think it would be very helpful for the ecosystem
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.620]   to get a couple of those under our belt.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.780]   - Well, there's talk that, oh, Mr. Lafon himself,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.220]   would you like to join us?
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.820]   I mean, just come on up here and join us for a minute.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.020]   We're live right now.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.380]   Philippe, we're just, first, thank you.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.220]   - Yeah.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.180]   - This is, you know, one of our favorite,
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.340]   if not our favorite, you know,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.820]   conference in the investing business.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.860]   And what I said to start is you are a positive sum.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.700]   You have all your,
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.260]   the folks that most people would think of
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.620]   as your competitors, you know, you invite 'em here.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.580]   You collaborate, you build partnership.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.500]   - I'm thinking about changing my mind.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:37:00.100]   - So we were just talking about the $10 billion to IPO,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.700]   right, which implies something around a billion dollars
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.580]   in revenue to go public, right?
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.180]   And I was saying, I would encourage OpenAI
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.220]   to go public today, right?
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.180]   We think more, I think, and Bill agrees,
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.660]   more of these companies should go public.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.340]   We think they can go public smaller.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.380]   We understand if you're a micro-cap
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.220]   and you don't have great margins
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.220]   and you're not growing fast, you can't go public.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.540]   But aren't there a lot of companies
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.460]   that could be public today?
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.940]   - Yeah, I mean, if you look at some of the big unicorns,
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.300]   they could definitely go public.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.180]   But I think there's two criterias.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.780]   One is, can you get to a billion of revenue?
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.900]   OpenAI would be, check, check, check the box.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.220]   But the second one is, do you have a sort of a break-even
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.620]   or a path to break-even?
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.180]   And the only thing, I don't know the specifics of OpenAI,
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.180]   but what if you had a billion in revenue,
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.220]   but like an enormous cash burn?
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.940]   And Barry, that cash burn is really smart.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.300]   It helps them consolidate as a clear number one.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.860]   But will the public markets be scared
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.940]   if the cash burn is disproportionate?
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.260]   But the private markets, the investors,
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.380]   they know that there's a bit of a winner-take-all
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.820]   and they might be more patient.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.500]   Now that's just on OpenAI.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.820]   SpaceX, amazing company.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.140]   It's sort of quasi-public,
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.220]   but why don't you give retail investors
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.660]   a chance to invest in SpaceX?
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.300]   They should have that right.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.500]   - It's been proven that it might happen.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.020]   If you're right about the billion, though,
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.860]   like if you have to have a billion in revenue
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.300]   and be growing, right?
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.820]   You gotta be at, what, 30% growth, 25?
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.900]   Like, if that's the hurdle rate,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   then how many VC companies are ever gonna make it
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.820]   to that level?
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.820]   Like, that'd be my question.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.980]   - Listen, I was speaking to your former colleague, Eric,
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.820]   at Benchmark, and he's like,
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.620]   this is a problem for the venture business.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.780]   This is a problem for our portfolio.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.220]   There's gonna be less exits and bigger exits,
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.980]   so it's gonna make the business that much more risky,
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.020]   and do we need to adapt in ways
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.180]   that maybe you have to reinvest behind your best companies
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.140]   because there's not gonna be as many of them?
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.940]   Do you need to provide companies
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.540]   the ability to win in other ways?
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.980]   What's weird to me is that the government,
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.780]   by trying to protect small companies
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.500]   and not allowing big companies to buy small companies
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.940]   so big companies get bigger,
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.980]   I think it's got the reverse effect,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.260]   where now small companies have one less chance of winning,
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.380]   and thus the public market is even less willing
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.660]   to hold a small company
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.900]   because it's less willing that it gets bought.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.660]   And so why bother with small companies
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.020]   when you can just own big?
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.020]   Guys, I love you, and I hope you reinvent me,
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.300]   re-invite me on this amazing podcast,
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.100]   but I'm going to deal with some other people.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.060]   - Thank you, thank you, thank you, brother.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:45.900]   That's great.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.740]   - That was good timing.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.180]   - I mean, by the way, he's also just one-of-a-kind human.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.020]   - I agree with you.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.700]   - And so it's fun to see him, I'm glad he jumped in here.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.660]   You know, Bill, I think it's a,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.460]   you know, one of the things he was talking about
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.580]   got me thinking about something.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.620]   You know, boards of directors, you know,
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.700]   they have influence over whether these companies go public.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.540]   Okay?
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.180]   And it starts early, you know, in the boardroom
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.220]   about setting the conditions and building the company
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.860]   in a way it's built to go public.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.700]   And I think one of the problems, you know,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.300]   here we talk about it reflexively.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.580]   I think we're going to look back at this.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.580]   I happen to be more optimistic on this.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.060]   I think we're going to look at this period.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.420]   It's going to be a by-product of the age of excess.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.060]   This is going to be like all these companies
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.700]   raise too much money at too high a valuation
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.340]   during the ZERP period,
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.380]   and therefore they couldn't go public.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.660]   And frankly, too many boards bought into this
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.380]   stay private forever business.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.420]   I think there is a whole new category of company coming
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.060]   that I hope that you lead the charge, I lead the charge,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.700]   and they lead the charge.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   There is no reason these companies,
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.540]   if we set the conditions early in the business,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.940]   stay fit, get profitable, you know,
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.900]   you don't have to grow at all costs,
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.180]   don't raise too much capital,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.340]   don't set the valuations too high,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.660]   you know, they can get public.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.300]   But, you know, it's going to be an interesting-
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.940]   By the way, before we transition to our last topic,
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.500]   I would point out one irony from all that we heard today
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.380]   and what you just said, which is,
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.500]   if the 1,400 number of private unicorns
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   that are the result of the age of access is a problem,
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.460]   it's not clear to me
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.980]   that we're doing anything different in AI.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.420]   Aren't we doing the exact same thing?
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.020]   So couldn't we end up with the exact same result?
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.380]   We just said 5X and 6X higher valuation.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.180]   You said something to me a few weeks ago
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.900]   that I think is spot on, right?
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.020]   I think 15 years ago,
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.340]   not a lot of people talked about the power law, right?
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.100]   Maybe there was a small cadre, a small membership,
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.660]   you know, on Sand Hill Road that talked about power law.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.260]   But today, everybody knows about power law distributions
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.900]   and venture returns, right?
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.580]   And so if there is any sniff
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.820]   that a company in AI land- I agree.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.980]   Is going to be the winner-
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.540]   They get $400 million.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.860]   The amount of capital that chases it.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.220]   So, you know, I think that's an interesting question.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.180]   I think it's very difficult for founders
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.500]   to resist the urge to take the money.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.100]   I think it's very difficult for founders
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.260]   to resist the urge to take the highest valuation.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.420]   I encourage them to reverse engineer from the outcome,
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.940]   the liquidity outcome they hope to achieve.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.380]   If you take a lot of money at a valuation
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.580]   well over a billion dollars,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.860]   the probability of you getting sold
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.340]   or you getting public is just a lot harder.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.380]   That's just the truth.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.740]   Before we move off in the venture section,
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.660]   one of the things I love
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.020]   is there are a bunch of founders running around here.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.620]   You and I, you know, met with one or two of them earlier.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.340]   And just a few of the anecdotes
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.140]   that I'm seeing and I'm hearing.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.660]   You know, I spent some time with Scott Wu.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.940]   I'm an angel investor in Cognition.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.500]   And, you know, Scott is building, you know,
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.980]   Satya referenced him while on stage.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.460]   Says, you know, co-pilot is building
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.100]   effectively auto-complete,
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.580]   allowing engineers to become more productive.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.100]   You know, Cognition is building engineers.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.580]   And I asked Scott, I said,
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.820]   "How many employees do you have?"
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.940]   Because I think he has tens of thousands
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.700]   of enterprise customers already.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.740]   And he said, "18."
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.300]   I said, "How do you do all this work with only 18 people?"
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   He said, "We have a hundred Devons.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.780]   We have a hundred agentic engineers
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.940]   that are helping us write code."
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.900]   That's a theme I've heard from Glean.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.100]   I heard from Distill.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.020]   I heard from Cognition.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.700]   This idea that we're going to have,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.260]   and Satya referenced it,
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.300]   a workforce of people, right?
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.420]   In the not so distant future
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.780]   that are going to be able to take
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.620]   these multi-step functions.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.420]   Go build me a website, right?
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.700]   No longer just complete a line of code,
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.780]   but complete an entire task.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.060]   You know, we were just with, you know,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.380]   our friend from Glean,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.820]   and who's building a great enterprise search product.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.180]   But, you know, you don't have to squint that hard
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.140]   to think that that could be your enterprise assistant,
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.060]   right?
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.300]   That could go perform tasks on your behalf.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.940]   So, put me in the camp.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.060]   Again, I don't know the time series,
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.380]   but I do think that we're on a path
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.420]   toward human replacement,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.780]   not just augmentation.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.660]   Now, I think those folks in this period of dislocation
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.660]   will get consumed in other tasks.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.420]   So, I don't think this is a net negative for society,
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.660]   but I do think you'll have dislocation
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.340]   before you necessarily have that growth on the other side.
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.580]   I'll just say one thing real quick,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.100]   which is I gave a speech 20 years ago or so
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.900]   about how we evolve with our tools.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.740]   And you wouldn't try and, you know,
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.300]   run a high production farm without a tractor.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.580]   You wouldn't do it with a plow and an oxen.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.420]   And that just always has been true in our society.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.980]   And so, if you are a programmer who's worried about this,
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.580]   the best thing you can do is run at it.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.740]   Like, go hang out.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.580]   Yes.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.060]   Play with cognition.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.100]   Get into GitHub Copilot.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.140]   Like, that and learn.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.700]   You know, Satya said that the ordering of the workflow
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.220]   of writing code is changing as a result of this.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.900]   You won't know that unless you're in it.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.740]   100%.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.580]   100%.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.460]   And a lot of the talk here is not just
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.060]   about who the winners are.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.020]   It's who the losers are, right?
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.260]   The losers in the public market.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.020]   You know, companies that are slow.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.700]   Think about if you were a company slow
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.020]   to adopt the internet in 2000.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.300]   If you were a retail enterprise,
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.940]   you said, "I don't need any commerce capability."
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.780]   Right?
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.620]   Right?
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.460]   That was a very bad decision.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.340]   I think in 2024, if you're any company and you say,
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.660]   "I'm going to be, you know,
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.420]   "I don't need to do all this AI stuff.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.260]   "I don't need."
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.580]   You need to be there even if you choose not to adopt it,
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.620]   because I think failure to learn how to reinvent
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.460]   your business is a problem.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.420]   I don't think you have to worry about this.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   I think most of them are there.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.260]   They're on it.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.100]   They're on it.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.220]   Well, another topic I think that, you know,
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.820]   we've talked about on this pod.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.380]   We had some developments on this week, you know,
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.780]   and I wanted to dig deeper in,
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.460]   and this is to the shareholder vote
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.100]   as it pertains to Tesla.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.060]   So we know now that Elon has won the vote for a second time.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.900]   Retail investors, I think, voted 90/10 in favor.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.020]   Institutional investors, something like 70/30 in favor.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.380]   I mean, even the passive ETF Vanguard
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.980]   voted in favor of the package.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.820]   Okay?
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.820]   But there was a big reveal here this week.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.900]   I think some tectonic plates started moving
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.500]   on something that you and I have identified
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.860]   as an issue for a long time,
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.340]   and it relates to ISS,
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.180]   Institutional Shareholder Services, and Glass-Lewis.
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:44.740]   So both of those organizations recommended a no vote
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.340]   or a vote against the shareholder package.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.260]   Okay?
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.980]   Now, that in and of itself is not that unusual,
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.620]   although I don't think it made sense
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.140]   because it was clearly in the best interest
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.180]   of shareholders, right?
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.380]   Stock would go up.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.700]   It did go up after the vote.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.980]   And, you know, so I started looking in again,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.460]   and I know you and I started talking
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.940]   about the background of ISS.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.540]   And just as a reminder, you know, ISS was founded in 1985,
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.900]   and the mission of the company
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.380]   was to provide advisory services to institutional investors,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.020]   supposedly to do research and governance
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.420]   on their performance,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.500]   and to help shareholders make informed decisions
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.980]   as to what would maximize their own value in the business.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.140]   And while all this sounds benign enough,
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.020]   many of us have argued over the years
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.660]   that ISS veered off course, right?
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.220]   And this started becoming kind of this cudgel
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.140]   to, you know, to coerce board behavior
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.540]   into ways that they deemed, right,
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.260]   in maybe societal best interest
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.500]   or in their perceived best interest,
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.340]   as opposed to the corporate best interest.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.980]   You and I have both served on boards
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.020]   where board members have said,
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.460]   "Well, I can't do this or I can't do that because of ISS."
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.420]   We know some of the best boards in the world, like Netflix,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.980]   takes it on the chin from ISS all the time
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.580]   because they don't do the things that ISS sanctions as worthy.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.060]   In fact, this got so bad that at the end of --
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.620]   or at the beginning of 2023,
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.420]   21 state attorney generals, right,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.140]   wrote a letter to ISS
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.780]   demanding that they explain -- and Glass-Lewis --
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.540]   to explain their advocacy objectives, right?
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.860]   So, in this instance,
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:30.140]   I think the fact that Vanguard, right, which is passive --
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.020]   these are not active investors --
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.140]   that they came out and they voted
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.700]   in the opposite direction of Glass-Lewis and ISS,
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.340]   I think it just laid bare some of the nonsense
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.100]   associated with these recommendations.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.780]   And I really wonder whether this is going to cause
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.580]   a ripple effect, right,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.500]   where people start pushing back now on ISS and Glass-Lewis.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   Right, because if a passive investor can do it,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.780]   certainly -- and the active investors,
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.100]   from retail, institutional,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.940]   they rejected ISS and Glass-Lewis straight out.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.060]   So, what do you -- any thoughts?
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.380]   -Yeah, well, a couple things.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.620]   So, one, I actually spoke to some people at ISS
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.220]   in their research group prior to our SBC conversation,
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.260]   and it became clear to me from talking to them
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.940]   that they're mostly backward-looking.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.420]   They talk to investors after the fact and say,
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.780]   "Do they appreciate this particular thing or not?"
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.340]   And they're not doing first principles
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.580]   thinking around shareholder alignment.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.780]   -Yeah. -And, you know,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.900]   and you said it lost their way.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.780]   I mean, it became a network effect, right?
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.380]   They charge both the company and the shareholder.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.140]   And, like, it certainly --
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.340]   -I mean, if there's a duopoly we should worry about
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.980]   in this country, it's probably ISS and Glass-Lewis.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.420]   But we're seeing every board to follow their marching orders.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.180]   -And the number one reason I hear,
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.780]   a very valid reason for companies to have super-voting
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:57.540]   is so they don't get held up by these companies
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.460]   in their attempt to do the right thing
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.020]   and implement a compensation package
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.380]   that is aligned with shareholders.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.660]   -Correct. -And as I said to you back then
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.500]   and I believe even more today,
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.980]   and I've seen more copycats of it,
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:16.700]   the Elon package is the most shareholder-aligned CEO
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.020]   compensation package I've ever seen.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.780]   I would be thrilled if all of my hired CEOs
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.020]   had a very similar package. -Right.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.340]   -I'd be thrilled. -Yeah.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.380]   -I think most of them wouldn't take it.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.460]   -Yes. -Because it requires
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.660]   outsized performance.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.780]   I think it's excellent.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.380]   I think that it's ridiculous that Netflix
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.340]   would ever get a no vote on anything
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.020]   because they've had incredible stock performance
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.020]   and industry-leading low dilution.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.140]   -Yes. -With their very innovative approach
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.620]   to compensation.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.420]   -It would be fun to look at a distribution.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:56.220]   -I actually had a chance to talk with the co-CEOs recently
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.860]   and they were still getting pushed back
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.340]   because I was applauding them on their structure
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.700]   and one of their board members says,
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.300]   "Well, they are even considering change
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   because ISF won't leave them alone."
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.020]   And it's just horrific.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.700]   But anyway, there's one other thing
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.540]   that I would highlight about this
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.900]   that relates more to the Delaware situation.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:23.780]   So it's my belief that many of the attorneys
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.900]   and lawyers that live in the Delaware ecosystem
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.300]   were very eager for Tesla to appeal this thing
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.500]   and push it to the Delaware Supreme Court.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.340]   And it has been wildly discussed here and in other places.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:41.620]   The reason that people chose Delaware is 100 years --
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.780]   I went back and looked up today --
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.180]   over 100 years of practice of being business-friendly.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.420]   Obviously, all these companies aren't located in Delaware.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.180]   -Yeah. -They're just choosing this.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.820]   And they're choosing this place
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.500]   because of its history of precedent
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:05.380]   and its history of how they adjudicate different things.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.780]   -Right. -And people felt
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.500]   that it was in the company's best interest.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.100]   Here today, with the Tesla situation,
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.980]   we have a company whose stock performed incredibly well
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:23.940]   and was brought to heel by a lawyer and a law firm
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.300]   with a contingent derivative lawsuit.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:32.620]   Their one customer had nine shares of stock.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.100]   -Nine shares. -It went up.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.180]   -Yes. -So if you consider the fact
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.820]   that, "Oh, I could be a public company in Delaware.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.820]   My stock could go up.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.620]   I can be --" And then they asked for $5 billion
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.900]   in compensation to the lawyer.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.740]   -They're still asking for it.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.220]   -And they had one customer with nine shares.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.140]   Like, how do you ask for $5 billion?
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.980]   If -- I will say this.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.740]   First of all, I think that these people that live in Delaware
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.380]   are very fearful that there won't actually be an appeal
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.100]   because then this thing just stands out there.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.060]   -Yes. -And I think it's horrible
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.020]   for the entire Delaware.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.380]   If I were the governor of Delaware,
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.580]   I would be scared shitless,
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.740]   scared shitless about what might happen.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:22.980]   If this judge hands out any penalty anywhere close
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:28.060]   that has over $100 million even,
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.380]   I think companies need to consider
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.300]   leaving Delaware as fast as possible.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.140]   -First, it's such a bad case law, right,
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.060]   in the state of Delaware.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.660]   I mean, to your point, the various states are --
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.180]   -Vigilante lawyers chasing any company with high performance
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.780]   or a big market cap
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.780]   and just trying to get them on a gotcha.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.340]   -For sure. -And see if they can get a judge
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.620]   to give them this type.
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.700]   -The corporate code that exists in various states
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.980]   around this country is very similar.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.460]   There's a model corporate code, and most of them adopt it,
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.700]   that's predicated on Delaware's corporate code.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.900]   What makes Delaware so different is 100 years
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.540]   of precedent of case law,
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.540]   which is very supportive of a lot of issues
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.140]   which were important to companies.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.900]   That predictability led companies to incorporate there.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.540]   Now we've thrown predictability out the window, right,
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.740]   and now we're talking about despite two shareholder votes
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.820]   that both voted in favor of giving Elon this package,
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.900]   both before and contemporaneous,
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.980]   and now that they're going to go back.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.060]   If they award -- I'm not $100 million, Bill.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.220]   If they award $1, right,
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.980]   I think you're going to see companies
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.260]   in the state of Delaware that leave the state of Delaware.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.660]   And by the way, I think we should be encouraging them
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.060]   to leave the state of Delaware if that's the case,
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.100]   because I would like to see a lot more jurisdictions
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.620]   develop a lot more friendly corporate codes,
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.340]   friendly precedent, you know, for these companies.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.540]   The reality is if we can't support
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.100]   a performance-based compensation package for a company,
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.180]   then what are we doing?
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.180]   Look at the garbage packages
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.300]   that people get paid tens of millions of dollars on.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.660]   Stock goes down, companies are terrible,
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.660]   ISS is cheering that that's a good compensation package,
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.580]   and it's no problem in the state of Delaware.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.900]   -Not to pick on one person, but people have highlighted
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.380]   that the CEO of GM has made tens and tens of millions of dollars.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.980]   Stock hasn't gone anywhere.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.060]   That's who, if they want to chase somebody,
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.100]   it's me chasing that situation.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.820]   But I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.740]   I think this is a very serious topic.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.180]   I think that the, you know, even, I think,
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.940]   like the "Wall Street Journal" and "The New York Times,"
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.980]   they missed this point.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:38.420]   And as you said, if it's not about shareholder alignment,
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.900]   what's the point? -Right.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.900]   -And then the last thing I would say is we started
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.140]   by talking about the dearth of IPOs
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.020]   and why aren't companies going public.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:51.060]   If this is the type of thing you expose yourself to
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.420]   by being public,
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.300]   then I understand why there are less public companies.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.940]   And I actually think, in addition to the fact
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.340]   that everyone in Delaware should be afraid of this,
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.420]   I think the SEC should be afraid of it.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.580]   Like, you shouldn't want this type of activity,
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:10.100]   this type of derivative suit, to come to the table.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.380]   'Cause with nine shareholders and an ask for $4 billion,
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.180]   it's clearly a shakedown. -Yeah.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.660]   -You wouldn't want that in your public market ecosystem.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.460]   -Right. How do we give assurances to other companies
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.340]   that are reincorporating to Nevada,
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.500]   reincorporating in Texas?
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.740]   You know, Tesla's move to, you know,
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.540]   was approved to move to Texas.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.540]   How do we give them comfort, you know,
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.580]   that they're going to be protected there
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.900]   against these type of cases? -I have work to do.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.260]   I need to go learn more. -Yeah.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.100]   -And, you know, as much as I would say
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.740]   that the governor of Delaware should be afraid,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.180]   the governor of Nevada and the governor of Texas
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.180]   should be putting together a task force
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.500]   to take advantage of this
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.900]   and to answer the question that you posed.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.620]   Like, what needs to be in place?
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.260]   Can you borrow some of the precedent case law?
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.460]   I don't know how that works. -Right.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:03.540]   -But, like, it's a -- I'm shocked,
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:07.980]   based on everything I've been told my whole life about why --
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.740]   You know, you say, "Why are all these companies
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.740]   incorporating Delaware?"
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.220]   Oh, it's the most business-friendly state
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.860]   from a judicial standpoint.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.420]   This blows that up.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.540]   -Well, I mean, one of the things I --
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.740]   Again, I'll go, you know,
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.980]   call my corporate law buddies up, as well.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.380]   Why can't the state of Texas say --
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.740]   You know, because you can't just make precedent up.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.420]   Precedent has to be the byproduct
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.580]   of somebody bringing a lawsuit.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.860]   That just takes time.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:34.140]   But you can draft it into your corporate code provision.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.900]   Like, you could simply say that, you know,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.300]   we're not going to allow these type of derivative lawsuits
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.620]   with, you know, that are totally,
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.860]   you know, a farce with nine shares
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:47.180]   to be brought in $5 billion of, you know, of awards given.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.500]   -I suspect you could take a industry-leading LLM
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.620]   and scan through the case precedent
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.580]   and help codify the law that you need.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.300]   -You know, for sure.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.980]   -So, tonight, you and I and Philippe have --
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.660]   You know, we're going to do a panel with Larry Summers,
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.780]   and we're going to talk a little bit about,
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.420]   you know, what the world looks like in 10 to 15 years
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.220]   as a byproduct of AI and some of the consequences,
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.020]   you know, that we may see.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.460]   And when you abstract away the next five years,
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.260]   you know, because who knows how long this is going to take
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.380]   and whether we bump up against scaling laws
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.500]   and all these other things.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.940]   When you look out 10 to 15, you know,
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.740]   any thoughts about, you know, what you want to hear,
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.500]   maybe from Larry or, you know,
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.500]   big-picture thoughts that you have,
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.900]   do you think the world is over its skis again, Bill?
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.980]   Or do you think this is -- Is this 2000,
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.300]   where we're going to go through perhaps
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.580]   a little bit of a rough patch here,
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.540]   but when we look back 10 or 15 years,
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.660]   it's going to be way bigger
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.900]   and way more consequential than we thought?
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.500]   -I didn't know you were going to ask me this question,
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.540]   but I'll tell you the one thing that's on my mind,
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:53.340]   and then I'll ask you the same question.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:58.220]   But I really don't believe in the deglobalization push
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:01.020]   that's coming from either of these presidential --
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.260]   I just don't believe in it.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.180]   I believe in Ricardo's comparative advantage.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.340]   I believe in lifting all people out of poverty,
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.220]   not just people that happen to be born
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.140]   in the same country as you are.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.380]   And that happens through globalization.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.820]   And I just think more people are --
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.860]   Like, the most people that have ever been made better off
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.340]   by one person was in China when Deng Xiaoping
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.140]   brought half a billion people out of poverty,
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.500]   and that happened by introducing capitalism.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.900]   And I just hope we can find a way to stop vilifying China
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:35.820]   and to stop thinking that you're going to re-onshore
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.580]   a whole bunch of --
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.940]   I don't think we'll be competitive globally.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.740]   -Yeah, yeah. -Anyway, that's what's on my mind.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.180]   -I mean, it's an interesting question.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.580]   If you flipped it back around,
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.340]   I'm really interested in the productivity gains,
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.580]   you know, that I think we can achieve,
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.700]   like, the big unlock here.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.540]   I'm interested in if he sees those same level
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.260]   of productivity gains that perhaps we saw
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.660]   in the '80s and '90s.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.100]   I'm really interested in how he thinks
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.340]   about our national competitive advantage, right?
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.740]   Like, the United States,
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.940]   if you just look at the performance over the last --
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.580]   right, the last 10 years,
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.860]   has been a byproduct of a lot of this globalization.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.860]   But I also see the flywheel spinning.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.540]   Like, you just look around here.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.020]   We have a system of risk capital
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.220]   that's better than anywhere in the world.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.740]   We have a system of risk-taking and entrepreneurship
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.100]   that's better than anywhere in the world.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.780]   The rate of innovation, better than anywhere in the world.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:31.180]   And so, to me, it also seems like --
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.460]   -Well, let's open up that skilled immigration gap.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.500]   -Yeah, no, I mean, like, that's, you know, absolutely one.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.020]   And I was -- not to go, you know, off-piste here,
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.420]   but I was talking with, you know,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.100]   the president of a major, you know,
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.700]   fintech company last night, public company,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.780]   who was at the business roundtable,
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.300]   you know, with Trump, and he said,
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.300]   you know, they were all shocked.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.860]   Their jaws were on the ground.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.980]   Trump walks into the room, starts talking about immigration.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.220]   You know, and while he says,
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.820]   "We got an illegal immigrant problem.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.340]   We got to -- you know, we got to tighten the borders,"
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.780]   they said it was the first time they ever heard him say,
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.420]   "And I got to solve the problem for everybody in this room,
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.660]   how I get you more talented workers."
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.500]   And he proposed something, apparently, at the roundtable.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.340]   He said, "Anybody who comes here for a four-year education,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.220]   completes their degree in the United States,
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.580]   we're going to give them a green card."
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.660]   -I like that. -Okay?
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.740]   Like, if that's true,
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.380]   this is one of our huge issues, right?
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.580]   This is the best place on the planet
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.140]   to start these businesses, you know,
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.900]   because of ecosystems like this,
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.980]   but ultimately, you look at, you know,
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.700]   Elon came here, right?
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.580]   Larry and Sergey, you know, so great to be with you.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.140]   -Yep, good to see you. -I look forward to chatting more
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.740]   tonight, and thanks for having us.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.340]   -Yep.
