[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   In the spirit of that hymn, I should like to call your attention this evening to the
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.280]   case of that rich young ruler, as we generally call him, the account of whom we read at the
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   beginning in the Gospel according to St. Mark in chapter 10 from verse 17 to verse 25, and
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.960]   reading in particular again verses 23, 24 and 25.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.840]   And Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.960]   have riches enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320]   And the disciples were astonished at his words.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.800]   But Jesus answereth again and saith unto them children, How hard is it for them that trust
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.840]   in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.040]   It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.480]   into the kingdom of God.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.000]   There, in those words, our Lord comments on the case of the rich young ruler who had just
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.560]   turned his back upon him and had gone away from him grieved and sorrowful.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.000]   Now these three verses, you notice, concentrate our attention once more upon this theme that
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.040]   has now been occupying our attention Sunday by Sunday since the last Sunday night of April.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.480]   It is indeed the great theme of the New Testament, and particularly of the Gospels, the theme
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.640]   All these messages have been about the kingdom of God, because according to our Lord the
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.440]   most important thing in this world is that we should all enter into it.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then all these other things shall be added
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   unto you.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.800]   The world is in trouble.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.080]   Men and women are in trouble.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.560]   And we are looking for relief.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.880]   We are seeking solutions.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   And we are troubled and worried and anxious and concerned.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.960]   To some it is only a matter of food and drink and clothing and so on.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   But we are all busy about something, trying to find satisfaction.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.520]   It is all wrong.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.080]   He says, "All wrong."
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.000]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.360]   Nothing is so vital as that we should enter the kingdom of God.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   And it is possible.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.360]   He says, "The time is fulfilled.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.200]   The kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   It has come amongst you."
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.440]   Accept and believe the gospel.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.120]   But as we have seen, though that was his message, the men and women of his own times, of his
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.280]   own age and generation, were in great trouble with respect to this.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.440]   You would have thought that with such a message and such a messenger that everybody would
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.240]   have listened and have believed, and they would have gone crowding into the kingdom.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   But they did not.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   They stumbled.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   They questioned.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   They argued.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   They were having difficulties at various points.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.240]   And we have been considering these various difficulties.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.160]   And we have noticed how varied they are and how they contradict one another.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   The lesson being this, that mankind by nature, and as the result of sin, is altogether and
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.400]   entirely wrong in all its ideas and its thinking concerning the kingdom of God or the kingdom
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.320]   of heaven.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.600]   And it is because that is still the same that I am calling your attention to this whole
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   matter.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   Here is this vital thing.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.800]   How can I enter the kingdom of God?
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   And I find that I am subject to all these misunderstandings.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.920]   And an element comes out, I think you must have noticed, in every single case.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.720]   And that is that the kingdom of God is always surprising.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.760]   It seems to be so different from what all these people thought.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.560]   It is so different from what all we think.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   Now this case we are going to look at tonight brings out that particular element in a very
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.640]   striking manner.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   And we shall see that as we proceed.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.120]   But let me also show you this other thing as we come to this tonight.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.160]   How these difficulties about the kingdom and these misconceptions concerning its nature
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.480]   and character and what one has to do in order to enter it, how they, as I say, contradict
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.080]   one another and are almost poles apart.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.520]   And yet they are all in trouble.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.240]   For instance, last Sunday night we were looking at that statement of the apostle Paul in 1
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.440]   Corinthians 6, 9 and following, "Be not deceived."
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.760]   And then this terrible list, "Neither fornicators nor adulterers," etc., "shall inherit the
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.720]   kingdom of God.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.240]   And we saw that that is a message that is needed very badly at this present time.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.320]   People seem to think the kingdom of God just announces that God is love, you can do anything
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   you like, break your vow, tell lies, be dishonest and unfaithful to your marriage vow, it does
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   not matter.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.000]   The love of God is going to put you all right at the end.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.960]   "Don't be deceived," says Paul.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.720]   Badness is not allowed in the kingdom of God.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.560]   The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.760]   Badness and righteousness keeps us out, however much we may say, "Lord, Lord," and think we
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   believe in him.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.800]   But now tonight, you see, we've got the exact opposite.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.880]   Mercy excludes us, but the point in this illustration tonight is that goodness is not enough.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.920]   Badness is wrong, but even goodness is not enough.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   And that is the major element, it seems to me, in this particular case of this so-called
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.360]   rich young ruler.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.560]   Now this is in many ways perhaps the peculiar fallacy of this present age and generation
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.160]   to which you and I belong.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.560]   It's more true of it than what we were dealing with last Sunday night.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.440]   I believe one of the main troubles of the present time is that people have got hold
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.640]   of the idea that the one thing that is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God and
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.880]   be all right with God is to be good.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.640]   Goodness is the key.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.240]   People no longer are interested in doctrine, they tell us, they are bumming at theology.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.840]   "Oh," they say, "the fathers, they talk toâ€”what's it matter?"
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.080]   As long as you're a good man and live a good life and so on, surely that's all that God
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   demands.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.560]   And therefore, you see, you get these people who talk about holding on to the Christian
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.120]   ethic though they've dropped the doctrine, and these people who say, "Well, I never go
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.680]   to a place of worship, of course, but I'm living the Christian life I trust."
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.400]   And you get people saying about others, as I read about a man saying about his father,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.920]   he said he was the finest Christian I ever knew, of course.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   He said he didn't believe any of the Christian teaching, but he was the finest Christian
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.320]   he'd ever known, simply because he was a good and a nice and a kind man.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   Goodness is regarded as being enough.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.360]   And so people who never come to worship God and who are not interested in the Christian
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.320]   faith and the doctrine of the faith, they regard themselves as good Christians because
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.960]   they're good men.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.920]   Now this particular case, it seems to me, deals with this in a final and in an exhaustive
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   manner.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.960]   It's an extraordinary case, this case of the rich young ruler.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.640]   It's a famous case, and it's a grievously misunderstood case.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   There are many, not so many as perhaps forty years ago, who think that this is a peculiar
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.360]   message to rich people.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.640]   This was one of the favorite texts of the people who used to call themselves Christian
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.320]   socialists and who talked such a lot about Christian socialism in the early years of
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   this present century.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.160]   They still do it, many of them.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.760]   And here they think is their one text where the rich man is condemned, and therefore all
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.320]   who are not rich are all right.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   But of course that's a complete misunderstanding of the whole incident and its teaching as
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.960]   I want to show you.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.360]   This is a message for every single one of us.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   This is a message that speaks directly to our particular case, whatever it may be at
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   this very moment.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.160]   It applies to us all.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.520]   Now let's have a look at it.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.800]   And of course it is, we'll all agree, one of the most surprising cases in the New Testament.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.600]   Of all the people who ever came to our Lord, there is no case that is so surprising to
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   the natural men as the case of the rich young ruler.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   As I've been saying, you would have thought that this was just the type of men that our
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.720]   Lord delighted in, that he wanted to see coming to him.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.320]   You would have thought that this was the type of men of all men who would have received
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.640]   an open arm, welcome, and would have gone without any difficulty into the kingdom, such
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.200]   an excellent young man.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.480]   And yet you see he went away sorrowful.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:32.040]   Now according to the modern view of the Christian, here is almost a perfect Christian.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.680]   And yet he's outside the kingdom, he goes away sorrowful.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.180]   Now this I say is astonishing, it's surprising, and it's amazing.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.280]   We are told that the disciples themselves, in their misunderstanding of the kingdom,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.360]   they really couldn't take it.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.480]   We read here in verse 26, "And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.720]   'Who then can be saved?'"
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.800]   The disciples I read in verse 24 were astonished at his words.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.640]   When they saw this young man going away, and our Lord's coming upon it, the disciples,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.040]   they couldn't understand this.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.160]   They said, "Isn't he in?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.720]   If he isn't in, who can be in?
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   This seems impossible."
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.880]   Now here you see is the thing I want to emphasize.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.920]   The kingdom of God is entirely different from everything that the natural men has ever thought
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.800]   about it.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.480]   The first thing we've got to do if we want to enter this kingdom is to shed all our preconceived
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:37.640]   notions and ideas, get rid of all our thoughts, and submit ourselves with humility and as
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.120]   little children to the teaching of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.640]   Now this is the first principle.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.500]   We all think that we know what a Christian is.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.040]   We all think we know what we've got to do to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.600]   And so we all think that this is the thing.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   The disciples thought it.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:03.000]   But our Lord shows them that they were altogether and entirely wrong.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.680]   That's why he's such an important case.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.840]   Look at him.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.080]   How well he starts.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.360]   You know, this young man always reminds me of typical English weather.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.320]   Starts with glorious sunshine in the morning, and you think you're in for a wonderful day.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.200]   But it ends in a storm.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.760]   Here it is, what could have started better than this man?
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.240]   What an excellent young man he is.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.960]   A good young man.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.240]   Who's been living a very good and a very moral life.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.160]   And yet you see, the best thing of all about him in a sense is this, that he's conscious
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.240]   of the fact that he needs something more, something further.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.120]   "Good master," he says, "what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.600]   Though he's so good, so noble, so excellent, he's not satisfied.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.840]   And that's the most wonderful thing to say about a man.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.640]   He's conscious, he's aware of some further need.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.440]   There are so many who are not.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.560]   They're self-satisfied, they're self-contained.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.840]   That was the trouble with most of the Pharisees.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.280]   They were not aware of any need.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   They just go before God and they say, "I thank thee, O God, that I'm not as other people.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.400]   Indeed that I am as I am."
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.520]   Not so, this young man.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.200]   What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.600]   I don't know, I sometimes think that what had brought him to that realization was that
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.640]   he'd been listening to our Lord and following him.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.880]   And from the moment he met him and had listened to him, he began to feel a sense of dissatisfaction.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.800]   He was better than most people, but, "Ah, here's something bigger, here's something
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   greater."
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.480]   He exposes some need, some lack.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.400]   So he's concerned about the satisfaction of this further need.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.720]   He hasn't got this eternal life and he wants to know how to get it.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.600]   Well, you can't say anything better about a natural man than that, that he's got an
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.480]   awareness of a need.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.680]   But beyond that, he does something about it.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.600]   He comes to our Lord, and do you notice the way in which he comes?
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.160]   And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.840]   Look at the eagerness.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   Look at the desire of this young man.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.880]   He doesn't say, "Oh, well, I can go and listen to him again."
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   No, no, this thing has become a big problem to him and he runs.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.280]   The eagerness, the zeal, the concern.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.000]   Well, what an excellent young man he is.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.160]   And then you notice his way of approaching our Lord.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.300]   He kneeled to him.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.880]   He showed him respect.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.920]   He showed that he admired him and was aware of the fact that here was no ordinary teacher,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.680]   that there was something peculiar and exceptional about him.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.600]   And so he comes and puts his question.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.800]   He wants to learn from Christ.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.480]   And he puts the right question, this question about eternal life.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.120]   Things were very good for him in this life.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.760]   He says, "What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.240]   You can't imagine a better question than that.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.440]   And indeed to cap it all and to prove that my understanding of the man is right, we are
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:16.280]   told this, "And Jesus beholding him loved him."
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.360]   Oh, he was probably a handsome young man to look at.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.480]   And our Lord likes his question.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   He likes his attitude.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.760]   He likes all these things about him.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   "And Jesus looking upon him loved him."
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.520]   Can you imagine a better start?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.320]   Don't you anticipate that the men go straight into the kingdom without any difficulty?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.240]   But that isn't the story.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.960]   Now my friends, here's the question.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.240]   What was the matter with this young man?
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   Why did he go away?
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.600]   Why didn't he enter the kingdom?
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   What's the trouble?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.880]   Do you know it can be put in one phrase.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:13.920]   This young man went away because of his profound misunderstanding of the kingdom of God.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.680]   And that is why our Lord makes this comment.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.360]   Jesus looked round about himself and to his disciples, "How hardly shall they that have
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.480]   riches enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:31.600]   Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God?
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.560]   It is nothing but his profound misunderstanding of the kingdom of God that sends this young
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.460]   man away disappointed and unhappy.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:51.140]   He went away grieved, wounded in spirit, sad at that saying.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.340]   Now before I proceed to the analysis and to discover with you why it was he went away
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:05.540]   grieved and sorrowing, let me ask a simple and an obvious question.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:11.820]   What has been the result of your coming to Christ and to listen to him?
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:18.340]   What's your reaction to the gospel of the kingdom?
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.620]   According to this teaching in the New Testament, there are only two reactions ultimately.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.020]   One is that you are so captivated by it that you immediately enter, or else that you are
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.500]   grieved by it and offended by it.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.100]   Here is a young man, I say, who was grieved at what Christ said and annoyed and sad at
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.380]   heart and he goes away sorrowful.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.820]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.460]   What has Christ done to you?
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.900]   You are bound to react to him in one way or another.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.700]   You know, if you have never reacted to him at all, it is because you have never come
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.060]   near him.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.660]   You see, we can sit in chapels and listen to sermons and read Bibles and never yet meet
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   him.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.060]   But when you meet him, there is one of these two inevitable reactions.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.700]   You either go after him, abandoning everything, or else you go away from him.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.220]   You are grieved with him, you are annoyed, you are upset.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.020]   Has Christ ever upset you?
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.480]   Have we come into such intimate contact with him that he has upset us and annoyed us and
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   offended us?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.140]   The apostle Paul talks about the offense of the cross.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.140]   I feel sometimes the trouble with so many is today that the cross means nothing to them.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.500]   It does not even annoy them.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.020]   It is not an offense to them.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.980]   But you know, there is something about this blessed person.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.820]   He is either everything to you or else he is an offense to you and you go away grieved
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.260]   and sorrowing.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:47.980]   What effect has he had upon us?
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.860]   You cannot be indifferent to him.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.740]   You cannot just look on and remain exactly the same at the end as you were at the beginning.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.140]   I would sooner see men and women annoyed by him and offended by him than feel nothing
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.780]   about him, because there is hope sometimes for the men who are offended.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.900]   He may be touched, he may be convicted, he may be wounded, and he will come back.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.360]   He will have to come back and he wants more.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.300]   But what is impossible is sheer indifference.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.700]   It means they have never seen him, they have never met him.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.580]   This young man was grieved and went away sorrowful.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.580]   Why?
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.860]   Well, let me try to answer the question.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.700]   And I will put it in the form of three principles.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:37.140]   He went away sorrowful because of what Christ did not say to him.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.460]   Now, that is odd, isn't it?
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.500]   But it is very true in this case.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.260]   He went away sorrowful because of what Christ did not say.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.500]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.700]   Well, I think the young man makes it quite obvious that he came to our Lord expecting
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.900]   him to say certain things, expecting him to give a particular answer to his question.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:05.100]   "Good Master," he says, "what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.700]   He expected Christ to confirm his ideas.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.220]   He had been listening to him, he had been watching him.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.980]   And he said, "Yes, I have done certain things, but the year he has, he has got something
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.500]   more, I want this thing."
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.540]   So he has worked it out and he comes and now puts his question and he expects a certain
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.540]   answer.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.540]   We all do that.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.340]   We all come to Christ and become concerned about the Kingdom of God with preconceived
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.100]   notions and ideas.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.980]   And we come to him for confirmation, but he did not get it.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.620]   Our Lord did not say to him what he had anticipated.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.180]   It is one of the reasons why he went away.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.420]   But that is putting it generally.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   Let me divide that up.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:51.500]   He expected our Lord to say, "Quite right.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.540]   What you need is just to add something to what you have got.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.740]   I can see you are very good.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.500]   I can diagnose you.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.700]   I can tell by looking at you more or less your position.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.900]   It is all right as far as you have gone, but you have not gone quite far enough.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.220]   You just need to add this thing, this one extra something to what you have got and then
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.060]   you will be in the Kingdom."
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.660]   But he did not say that.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.300]   He never says that.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.740]   That was Nicodemus's fallacy, was it not?
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.260]   No doubt at all about Nicodemus.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.260]   He had got this same notion.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.100]   "I am a master of Israel.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.580]   This man has got something I have not got.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.100]   I want this something extra."
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.940]   We all think that Christianity is something we add on to our lives.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.220]   It never is.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.060]   There is something explosive about it.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.660]   It smashes all we have got.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.260]   This young man was smashed.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.500]   Our Lord demolished him.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.900]   You cannot add on.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.740]   It is not a matter of simple arithmetic, simply adding to what you have got.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   No, no.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.740]   It is altogether different.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.020]   It means being born again, starting afresh.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.500]   All you have got is useless.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.620]   Your righteousness is as filthy rags.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.940]   You do not add on.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.500]   You receive it all.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.620]   Now, the young man was upset by that.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.820]   Our Lord did not say what he expected him to say at that point.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.180]   And then the second way in which we can put this particular matter is this.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.700]   He was expecting our Lord to tell him to do something that he could do with comparative
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   ease.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.300]   "Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.740]   This is it, isn't it?
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.700]   Good idealistic young men, thoughtful reader, moral, concerned about uplift of life and
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.180]   improvement of the race.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.140]   "Tell me what you want me to do."
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   Christ is one who appeals to this young man of noble outlook, this idealistic understanding,
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.580]   this man with this beautiful orientation on life.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   "Tell me.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   I am ready.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.420]   What must I do?"
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:58.180]   And what he is told is that what he needs to do is something that he will not do, that
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.000]   entry into the kingdom is beyond his capacity.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.060]   With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.280]   You see, this is this fatal fallacy.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.660]   It runs through the whole of the scripture that a man can earn his salvation, that a
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.500]   man can make himself a Christian, that a man by striving can enter the kingdom of God,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.420]   that a man by doing can make himself a child of God.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:28.260]   Here comes a blank denial, a "No."
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:33.300]   So I say that the first reason why this young man went away sorrowful was because of what
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.220]   Christ did not say to him.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.540]   You know what he was expecting.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:42.740]   "You have done very well, but now go and do this further thing.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.460]   Go and add this something else.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.820]   There is just another good work you have not thought of.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   It is all right.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.600]   It is easily within your competence.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.020]   Go and do it."
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.580]   And he was ready to do it, just this addition.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.820]   But no, our Lord does not tell him to do anything like that.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:05.140]   He gives a denial, as it were, to this self-confidence and assurance which man has in his own ability
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.020]   to please God and to make himself righteous.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.580]   The man was offended by what our Lord did not say.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.220]   But come, let me come to something more positive and more important.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:27.140]   He was offended and went away sorrowful because of what Christ did say.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.580]   It was not only the negative; it was what Christ actually did say.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.580]   What did he tell him?
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.020]   "Well, here it is again.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.340]   Let me put it in the form of a principle.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.820]   Our Lord told this young man, as plainly as words can ever put it, that morality and goodness
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.820]   are not enough."
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.100]   "What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.260]   Jesus said unto him, "Why callest thou me God?
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.340]   There is none good but one, that is God.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.820]   Thou knowest the commandments.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.820]   Of course you do.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.740]   I can tell by looking at you.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.260]   You are learned young men and you are religious and you have paid great attention to the teaching
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.260]   of the law.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.300]   Thou knowest the commandments.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.120]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   Do not kill.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   Do not steal.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.780]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.780]   Defraud not.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.860]   Honour thy father and mother."
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.620]   You see, those are the commandments, the second table of the law.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.900]   And oh, how they are needed at the present time.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.960]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   Do not kill.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   Do not steal.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.500]   Adultery, lying, we have read a lot about these things in the last days, haven't we?
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.540]   Well, very well, they are still the commands of God, the second table of the ten commandments.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.500]   And our Lord says, "You know all about them."
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:45.140]   The young man answers and says, "Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.820]   "Of course, I agree.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.300]   You are right."
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.820]   And this is the kind of life I have been living.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.300]   I have never done anything else.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   I have never committed adultery.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   I have never killed anybody.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   I have not stolen.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.860]   I have not borne false witness.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.300]   I have always spoken the truth.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.780]   I have not defrauded anybody.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.380]   I have honoured my father and mother.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.340]   All these have I observed from my youth.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.940]   All is well, therefore is it.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.140]   Here is the reply to that.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.420]   Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said unto him, "One thing thou lackest."
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.640]   It is not enough.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.460]   You can keep the commandments, but still it does not put you in the kingdom.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.460]   You can keep these.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.860]   It is the second table only, remember.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.860]   He has not mentioned the first.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.420]   It is the second table.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.020]   But you can be right on these and still you do not go in.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.300]   Now this is the modern position, is it not?
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.500]   A good moral man living a clean life, out to improve the lot of the race, making sacrifices.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.540]   Ah, the finest type of Christian.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:46.820]   No, says Christ, morality and goodness are not enough.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.440]   They do not admit one into the kingdom of God.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.020]   But come, the second point under this second heading is this.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.100]   And here we come to the heart of the matter.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:09.700]   The young man went away sorrowful because Christ told him the simple, plain and unvarnished
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.860]   truth about himself.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.440]   He went away sorrowful because Christ told him the real trouble in his life.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.160]   Now here is the thing that always cuts and hurts and offends.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.880]   Here we see standing out this tremendous understanding of human nature that our blessed Lord had.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   John has got a most interesting word about him.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.320]   Here is a wonderful illustration of it.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.920]   At the end of the second chapter of John's Gospel we read this.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.440]   Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast day, many believed in his name.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.680]   They saw the miracles which he did.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.520]   But Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.480]   any should testify of men, for he knew what was in men.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.800]   And here is the rich young ruler, this noble young man standing before him.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.440]   Our Lord reads right into the depth and centre of his being and he exposes to him his real
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.520]   trouble and his real need.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.320]   Now here is the principle.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.640]   We all think that we know what we need.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.680]   We all think we are experts at diagnosing ourselves and our own case.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.640]   We say, "Well, I'm doing this and that, but it isn't enough.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.960]   What I need is, well, I want further light, I want further knowledge, I want further understanding."
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.040]   That's how we talk to ourselves, isn't it?
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.200]   We say, "Well, yes, of course, I know, but I'm still not quite right.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   I'm not quite happy.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.160]   I haven't got a full intellectual understanding of that odd pint of theology.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   That's my trouble.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.920]   I don't see how a God of love can be a God who punishes at the same time.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.240]   I can't quite get this idea of atonement, of one dying for another.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.960]   It doesn't seem to me to be quite moral.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.080]   My difficulties are intellectual, you see.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.640]   So I come to Christ in order to get the resolution of my intellectual problems and questions
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   and difficulties.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.380]   My problems are entirely intellectual.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.880]   And so I go to Christ to get them solved and to put me in order intellectually.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.000]   So I go to him.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.520]   This young man went to him in that spirit.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.360]   But you see, he has come to one who reads us like an open book.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.320]   He comes to one who knows us better than we know ourselves.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.000]   He comes to one who penetrates behind all the sham and the pretense and the camouflage
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.860]   and all we delude ourselves with and all we fool others with.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.160]   He sees to the heart of the problem and he exposes it and puts it in front of us.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.200]   And that's the thing that kills.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.520]   He did it with this young man.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   Listen.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:29:00.040]   "Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him, 'One thing thou lackest, go thy way.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.960]   Sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.880]   And thou shalt receive treasure in heaven and come, take up the cross and follow me.'
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.400]   That was the thing that did it."
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.520]   Now in this particular man's case, the trouble was his riches.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.160]   There's no doubt about that at all.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   But you notice it wasn't the riches as such.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.400]   Our Lord makes that quite clear.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.720]   How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.240]   The disciples were astonished at his words, "But Jesus answereth again and says unto
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:39.520]   them, 'Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   of God?'"
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.040]   In other words, the trouble with this young man was not merely that he was a wealthy young
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.040]   man.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.960]   It's not a question of riches.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.240]   It's a question of pride in riches.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.820]   It's a question of confidence in riches.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.440]   It isn't merely the possession of money.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.640]   But the trouble with this young man was the power of money.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   What he could do with his money and what he could bring to pass with his money.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.080]   Money is power.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   And this young man knew it.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.720]   That's why a rich man is in a very dangerous position.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:16.080]   Because money is power and the trouble with all of us ultimately is that we desire power.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.960]   It isn't only money.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.680]   It's equally bad when it's pride of intellect and power of mind, power of intellect, power
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.760]   of speech.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   Any power is always dangerous.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.960]   All power corrupts.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.320]   Here it happens to be the power of money.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.800]   Because with his money he could do such a lot of good and he was a man who liked doing
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   good.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.960]   But he liked to do it and he liked to do it in his time and he liked to do it in his way.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   It gave him great self-satisfaction.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   Now don't misunderstand.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.720]   He really did a lot of good with his money.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.480]   Yes, but you see, it was he who was doing it and the self-satisfaction and the pride
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.440]   and he wants to keep his hand on the wealth.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.960]   "Give it away," says Christ.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.280]   "Let me decide."
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.640]   You see, it isn't merely the money, it's his attitude to it.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.760]   It is his reliance upon it.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.400]   It is his trust in it.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:12.200]   I've no doubt that partly came the enjoyment of what money can buy, the food and the companions
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.360]   and the fellowship and the comforts of life and all these things.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.220]   Yes, throw them in if you like, but the essence of it is just that.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.600]   That the man was in charge and in control of his money and what he can do with his wealth,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.040]   he trusts in it in that sense.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   But let's not be misled into imagining that our Lord is only talking about money.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.040]   We are all holding on to something.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.640]   We are all taking pride in something and that's the thing that constitutes the obstacle to
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   our entry into the kingdom of God.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.400]   It may not be wealthy in your case, my friend, and yet you see the thing is so interesting,
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   isn't it?
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.760]   We don't hear so much about this being used against wealthy people at the present time.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   Why?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.080]   Well, because of this great leveling process that's taken place.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.040]   There was once in this country rich people, poor people.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   That's rapidly disappearing.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.320]   We're all coming to a kind of common level and in the old days even the trouble with
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.040]   the poor man was that he wanted to be rich.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.520]   His objection was not the riches but that the other men had got it and not he.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.720]   The poor man has often been as covetous as the rich man.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   We fool ourselves in this respect but it isn't a question of money.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.860]   We come to Christ, we're interested in religion.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.280]   We want help, we say.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.520]   We want this knowledge, this understanding.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.600]   We think we need intellectual understanding and that isn't what we need at all.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.920]   And here our Lord, I think, speaks to this present generation.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.560]   They're trying to make us think that the trouble with the religion is intellectual.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.360]   That's why they're writing these books.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.280]   They say it's no use preaching that old gospel in 1963 in this scientific age, this atomic
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.120]   age, this age of the astronaut, this age in which people think and are educated and cultured.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   They won't take it.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   They won't accept it.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.320]   You know, they say you've got to give them a message that will appeal to their intellects
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.640]   and to their understanding.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   The problem is an intellectual one so we must reconstruct the faith and start anew and produce
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.640]   a gospel for the men of the 1960s.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.240]   And here is the final answer from the Son of God himself to it.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.760]   He says, "No, the problem is not intellectual.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.480]   It's moral.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.200]   It's always moral."
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.800]   The difficulty about the Kingdom of God is never intellectual.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.640]   This is the camouflage we put up.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.360]   This is the false problem that we think is troubling us.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.440]   This is the false question we ask.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   We are concealing something.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.840]   Christ with his penetration gets through it all.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   He says, "Look here.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   Here's your trouble.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   It's this pride of money.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.600]   It's this reliance upon money.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.200]   It's this power that he's giving you.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.440]   That's the thing you're proud of.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.240]   It isn't these questions you're asking me.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   It's this that I'm..."
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.080]   "Go, sell all that thou hast."
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.680]   He's exposed the trouble.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.440]   He's convicted the men of his essential sin.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.680]   And that's why he went away sorrowful, and Christ always does that.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.040]   Has he put his finger on your particular sin, my friend?
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.840]   If you can't say yes, it means that you've never met him.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.780]   This is the startling thing.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.080]   We come with our intellectual problems, our scientific difficulties, our lack of understanding.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.560]   Oh, we think we need a little help here or there.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.160]   "No," he says, "that isn't your trouble.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.000]   It's that lust that's controlling you.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   Lust of money, lust of power, physical lust, sexual lust, whatever it is, he comes straight
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.440]   to the center.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.280]   And you are held face to face with yourself and the running sore of your soul."
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:58.440]   He did it with this young man, and that is the second reason why he went away sorrowful.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.720]   And then a third reason is this.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:09.000]   He says unequivocally that the kingdom of God must be entered in his way and in nobody
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.320]   else's.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.400]   So he issues a categorical imperative.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.520]   He makes a totalitarian request.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:24.120]   "Go, sell all that thou hast, give to the poor, and come."
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:32.520]   I needn't stay with this, but it is a fundamental principle of this gospel of salvation.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.720]   He decides how you enter the kingdom.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.840]   We don't.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.920]   We just submit and obey and follow him.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.440]   We just make an absolute surrender to him.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.080]   It isn't our idea, it is his.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.760]   And that's where the offense comes in.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.000]   The young man went away grieved and sorrowful.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   "Why?"
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.280]   "Well," he said, "I thought the way into the kingdom was to do the things I've already
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.640]   done and to add something to it, and I was ready to do it, and I believe I could have
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   done it."
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.240]   He makes an impossible request.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   He says the thing is impossible, I can't do that.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   He says, "Monstrous!
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.400]   Ah, the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us that
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.240]   are saved it is the power of God.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:25.600]   The Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   They won't have it.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.720]   The cross, there it is, the offense of the cross, the hatefulness of the cross, but it's
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   there."
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   He says there is no other way.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.320]   You've got to come this way.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.040]   Your intellect's got to be humbled.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.440]   Your pride's got to be put down.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.200]   You've got to come as a little child.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.520]   You've got to enter in.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:54.040]   There's only one way into the kingdom, Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.120]   And man hates it, and man objects to it.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.680]   He says, "I believe in, I like Jesus.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.800]   I admire his person.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.960]   I like his teaching.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.800]   The sermon on the mount is to me wonderful.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   I like his ethic.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.600]   I admire it, but when you tell me that I've got to believe that he died for me, that he
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.480]   bore my punishment, it's monstrous, it's immoral.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   I can't.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   I will not."
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:23.280]   And away they go, offended by the most glorious thing of all, as this young man went away.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.840]   But my friend, it is he who decides, not you, not I.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.080]   I don't stand in this pulpit to announce what I think.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:39.200]   "I determine," says Paul, "not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.720]   Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.960]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.600]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.200]   The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   for many."
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.480]   Christ goes on to say this very thing in this tenth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   Mark.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.760]   It's the only way, and you've got to submit to it.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   He couldn't submit to it.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.920]   He went away sorrowful.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:16.040]   And then there is finally this call to appeal, to follow him, this allegiance that he demands.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.520]   "Come," he said, "after you've given away all the proceeds of the sale.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.720]   Take up thy cross and follow me."
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   What does it mean?
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.360]   Oh, it means this.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.280]   Not that you enter into the highest intellectual circles of respectability, not that you'll
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.000]   get all the plaudits and the applause of men.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.840]   No, no, it means you take up your cross.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.760]   It may mean separation from your nearest and dearest, as he's just been saying.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:55.580]   It may mean leaving father, mother, child, wife, children, lands, a cross.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:00.020]   It may mean persecution from your own home, from your nearest and dearest friends.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.700]   It may mean tearing your heart strings and breaking your heart.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:10.400]   It may mean going out as the offspouring of the world and being regarded as a fool.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.520]   Take up thy cross and follow me."
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   And where is he going?
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.360]   Well, he proceeds to tell them, "He's going up to Jerusalem.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.040]   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.840]   and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death and they shall deliver him to
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.480]   the Gentiles, and they shall mock him and scourge him and spit upon him and shall kill
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   him.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.360]   Christianity is something marvellous and wonderful and the whole world will praise you."
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   No, no, a cross, a shame, to be despised, to be reviled, to be a fool for Christ's
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   sake.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.240]   He's caused you to.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.560]   Not world reform, not popularity, not rejoicing, but the exact opposite.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.320]   "This is the way," he says.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:07.160]   And it is because he said things like that to him that this young man went away sorrowful.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:12.600]   He went away sorrowful, I say, because of what Christ didn't say.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.960]   He went away sorrowful because of what Christ did say.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.720]   But my third and last reason is this.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:32.960]   He went away sorrowful because he went away from Christ.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.200]   What do you mean, sir, someone?
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.920]   Let me tell you hurriedly.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:48.240]   He went away sorrowful from Christ because he didn't realize his real need.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.640]   He thought he was all right but needed something extra.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.360]   He didn't realize he was lost.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.880]   He didn't realize he was under the wrath of God.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.440]   He didn't realize he was helpless and hopeless.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.720]   He didn't realize that he was outside the kingdom and that if he remained there he'd
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   go to hell.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.120]   He didn't realize it.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   He wasn't desperate.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.600]   That's the trouble with these men who go away from Christ.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.200]   They come in intellectual interest.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.600]   They come to put very good questions.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.280]   They're good men as far as they go, but in a sense that's their trouble.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.960]   They've never realized they're lost.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.720]   They've never realized they're sinners.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.880]   They've never realized they can't save themselves.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.640]   They've never realized what's awaiting them, that their position is a desperate one and
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   a hopeless one.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.200]   If he'd only realized that, he would never have gone away.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   He'd have stayed.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:44.320]   He'd have flung to him as the only possible hope, but he'd never seen that.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.680]   Now my friend, are you a Christian?
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.080]   Are you in the kingdom of God?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.400]   Are you a follower of Christ?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:59.240]   If you're not, you know this is the main reason you don't realize your position.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.840]   You don't realize the truth about yourself, that you're an enemy of God, that you're under
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:11.960]   the wrath of God, and that if you die like that, you will go to eternal misery.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.920]   If you realized that, you wouldn't stay where you are a second.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.660]   You don't realize that.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.800]   That's why you're talking about these intellectual difficulties and problems and these other things,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.080]   and that's why you're just interested in Christ.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.720]   You haven't realized that he's your only hope, your last hope, and that without him you're
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.120]   eternally lost.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.520]   This young man had never realized it.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:38.160]   If he had, he'd never have gone away.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.520]   And let me add to that this which goes with it.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:47.240]   Of course, he didn't realize who Christ was and why he'd come into the world.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:52.880]   He'd regarded him as just a very good man and an exceptional teacher, the unique teacher,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.680]   the greatest teacher perhaps that had ever appeared, but he was nothing more.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   Christ pulls him up.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.560]   He says, "Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.120]   And Jesus said unto him, "Why callest thou me good?
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.040]   Do you realize what you're saying?"
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   He says, "You've called me good.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.000]   There's only one who's good.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.160]   Does this term really apply to me or doesn't it?
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.440]   Do you realize its meaning and connotation?"
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.400]   He was saying to him, "Men, listen to the word you've used yourself.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   You've said I'm good.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   You're right.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   There's only one who's good.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   I am God.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   You've applied it to me.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   You don't know what you're saying.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.920]   You're saying the truth, incidentally.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.480]   I am son of God.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.000]   I am one who's come out of eternity into time.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.040]   I am God, the Son come down on earth, the incarnation, the person of Christ."
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.920]   The young man doesn't realize it, but this is the truth.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.680]   He puts his right question, "What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.880]   What our Lord is really telling him is this, "I am eternal life.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.760]   You've put your question to the right person.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   You've called me good.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   You're right.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.000]   I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.920]   And I'm able to do that because I am who I am.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.520]   Men can't give you eternal life.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.000]   I can give you eternal life.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   I've come to do it.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   How can I do it?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.160]   Well, I am who I am.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.320]   I am the Son of Man.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.840]   I am the Son of God.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.640]   I am come from God.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.920]   And He sent me to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   Look at me.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.920]   Realize what you're saying.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.640]   I'm at the answer to your question.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.720]   I am the giver of life.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.240]   I am life itself.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.560]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   Why?
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.880]   "Well, because I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.880]   I'm the light of the world.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.360]   I'm the life of the world.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   I'm everything.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   It is all in me."
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   "Listen," he says.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   "Listen again.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.440]   Realize what you're saying."
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.400]   But the young man didn't realize it.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.720]   You see, if he'd only realized his need and his lust, his state and condition, and that
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.480]   this is the Son of God who's sent to save the world, the Lamb of God that taketh away
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.040]   the sin of the world, he'd never have left Him.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   He'd have clung to Him.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   He'd have held on to Him.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.840]   He'd have said, "I believe.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   Take me in."
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.920]   He hadn't realized the truth about himself.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   He hadn't realized the truth about the Son of God, the Savior of his soul.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:30.040]   And lastly, he had completely failed to realize the truth about the treasure in him.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Listen.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:39.240]   "One thing thou lackest, go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor,
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:45.160]   and thou shalt have treasure in him."
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.480]   He went away sorrowful, grieved.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   Why?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   Oh, because he's ignorant of the nature of the treasure in him.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.680]   He's an expert on the treasure he's got on earth.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   He's ignorant of the treasure that is there in him.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.560]   He doesn't know anything about the joy of forgiveness.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.840]   He doesn't know what it is to be given new life.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.920]   He doesn't know what it is to become a child and a son of God.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.680]   He doesn't know what it is to be a joint heir with Christ.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.560]   Poor man, he'd got his estate.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.640]   It was wonderful.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.720]   The biggest estate in the district, and the envy of all the other estate owners.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.440]   But my dear man, says Christ, if you put that by the sight of the honor inheritance that
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.200]   may be yours if you believe in me, it's nothing.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   Heirship of Christ, heirship of heaven, and of God, and joint heirship with Christ, and
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.160]   the glory of eternity that awaits the children of God.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.440]   He knows nothing about it.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.280]   He knows so much about this that he's ignorant about that.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.120]   He's so keen on time that he ignores eternity.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.280]   All he's got will soon be gone.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.840]   When he dies, he leaves it behind him.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.240]   He can't take it with him.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.520]   All his wealth, his estate, his property, his everything, is there.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   It's crumbling.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   It's decaying.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.520]   And he dies.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.200]   Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   They're empty handed.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   Nothing.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:17.520]   "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth," says Christ, "where moth and rust doth corrupt
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.460]   and thieves break through and steal.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:26.400]   But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.520]   where thieves break not through nor steal."
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.100]   There's the place to put your treasure.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.960]   But this young man knew nothing about it.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.920]   He was so interested in the present he didn't consider the future.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.480]   He was so interested in what he had materially that he was ignorant of the wealth of heaven
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.880]   itself and the glory of everlasting bliss.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.960]   Treasure in heaven?
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   He knows nothing about it, and away he goes, sorrowful, miserable, and unhappy.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.680]   That's why he went away sorrowful.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.760]   He went away from Christ.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.600]   And these are the two lessons taught us, therefore, by this rich young ruler.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   Have you learned them?
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   Have you noted them?
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.400]   Let me pick them out for you as I finish.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.360]   Have you realized the danger of relying on anything in yourself?
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:34.240]   Money, intellect, morality, good living, good behavior, goodness, philanthropy.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.620]   Put in anything you like.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.760]   If you're relying on any of it, you're outside the kingdom.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.600]   That's the first lesson.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:49.080]   The fatal error of relying on anything, putting your trust in anything that you have or that
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.560]   you can do or that you can produce.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:49:10.060]   But oh, the second lesson, to turn away from Christ always leads to sorrow.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:16.100]   He went away sorrowful.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:23.380]   And all who turn their backs on Christ have nothing to look forward to but sorrow.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.140]   You'll never have happiness in this world apart from Christ.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.140]   You may think you have.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.140]   It won't last.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.140]   Sorrow.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:35.580]   It's a world of sin and of sorrow, a world of shame, a world of unhappiness, a world
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.580]   of disappointments.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.180]   Sorrow is the lot of all who turn their backs on Christ.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   It's sorrow in this life.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.020]   Judas later turned his back upon him.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:53.100]   And he went out and it was night.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.700]   And he committed suicide.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   To leave Christ is always a spiritual suicide.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.780]   You're turning away from your Savior.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.540]   You're turning away from life, which is life indeed.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:09.700]   You're turning away from God, who came to die for you and to save you.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:15.620]   You're turning from the only one who can give you happiness, peace, and joy.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.140]   Thou hast made us for thyself.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.060]   And our hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.940]   There is no resting place in life in this world apart from Christ.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.700]   And if you leave him, if you turn your back on him, if you go away from him, you're always
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:31.700]   going to sorrow.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.140]   It's like that in this world.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:40.420]   But oh, what of the next?
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:47.980]   To turn your back on Christ in this life means eternal misery in the next.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.700]   There's the lesson of the ten virgins, the five foolish ones who come when it's too late
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.380]   and hammer at the door, "Open unto us!"
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.380]   Now, too late.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:01.420]   And there they remain in their folly and their misery.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.620]   That rich man again, you remember, the story of the rich man and Lazarus, he again sees
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.060]   it too late.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.460]   He wants a message sent to his brethren, "Unless they do the same thing and be guilty of the
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:20.340]   same folly, go and tell them, Mises, it's too late, eternal misery."
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:25.980]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.140]   him shall not perish, but if they don't, they perish, and perish everlastingly.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:40.740]   Oh, my dear friend, to turn your back on Christ is always to go away sorrowful.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:49.020]   It leads to sorrow, it ends in sorrow, and there's nothing for such a soul but sorrow.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:54.900]   God grant that we all shall have learned the lesson of this rich young ruler tonight about
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.860]   the way of entry into the kingdom of God.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:05.860]   Listen, put it like this, Jesus calls us o'er the tumult of our life's wild, restless sea.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:13.500]   Day by day his sweet voice calleth, "Sing, Christian, follow me."
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:20.780]   Jesus calls us from the worship of the vain world's golden star, from each idol that would
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:27.740]   keep us saying, "Christian, love me more."
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.740]   Have you heard him?
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.900]   Have you heard his voice calling you?
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:38.340]   This Son of God who can give you eternal life and everlasting bliss and joy, he's calling
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   you.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.380]   Are you ready to join me in saying this?
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:49.820]   Jesus calls us, "By thy mercy, Savior, may we hear thy call.
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:58.220]   Give our hearts to thine obedience, serve and love thee."
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.860]   Best of all, oh, my dear friend, don't go away from him.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:06.460]   If you leave him, you have left your last hope, you have left your only hope.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:11.900]   There's nothing remaining but misery, grief, sorrow, unhappiness, everlasting.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.380]   Don't go away from him.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.660]   But just as you are, give yourself to him.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.220]   Let him speak to you.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.340]   He has spoken to you.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:27.540]   He's exposed your real trouble, your real sin, the thing you're holding on to, rather
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   than he.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.540]   Oh, listen to him.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:35.700]   He's calling you from the vain world's golden star, from each idol that would keep us saying,
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.420]   "Oh, Christian, love me more."
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   Consider who he is.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.100]   Consider what he can do for you.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:46.020]   Consider the joy that remains for you if you sell all that you have, as it were, and take
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.340]   up your cross and go after him.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.140]   "Hear him, I plead with you."
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.620]   Don't turn your back on him.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.300]   You're going to misery, endless misery.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:54:03.460]   "Fall at his feet, look up into his face, and say to him, 'Here I am, take me.'
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:09.020]   Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me, and that thou bidst
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:17.100]   me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:24.500]   If you've never said that to him before, say it now, ere it be too late.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.340]   Amen.'"
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.260]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
