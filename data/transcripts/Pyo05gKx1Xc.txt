[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We become like what we watch.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The objects of our attention shape our becoming.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Our potential as creatures is realized by what we behold.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We are moldable creatures of clay,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   conforming to whatever attracts our gaze most.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   What we behold shapes us for better or for worse.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And obviously this is a profound reality that carries with it massive implications
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   for our media diets in the digital age, as we'll hear today from Pastor John,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   preaching long before the digital age.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   In this clip, over 30 years old, Pastor John is applying
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   the glorious text of 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to our media diets. Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And then finally, my fourth suggestion,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and probably it's the most needful to hear
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and the most practically applicable for change right now in your life,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   perhaps, is
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   focus your attention on the glory of God.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Focus your attention on the glory of God,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and there's a reason for this.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You become what you behold.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now that's not just a nifty little saying.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's a straight out biblical paraphrase
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   of 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'll read it to you. 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18 says,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "And we all with unveiled face,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   are being changed."
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Just stop right there. How do you get changed?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Behold the glory of God.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   If you behold the glory of God and hold it in fixed view,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   you will become like that.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   In your mind, you will think the way God thinks,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   see the way God sees, feel the way God feels,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   assess the way God assesses. You will be repelled by the things that repel God
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   when you behold the glory of the Lord.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Let me finish reading.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   "We all with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into His likeness
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   from one degree of glory to another." I just love that phrase.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's so hope-giving because I know I've got such a long way to go.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   One degree of glory to another. It's progressive.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   The holiness that comes by beholding the glory of God does not happen instantaneously.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   From one degree of glory to the next, we move toward the image of Christ.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But the point I want to make here is,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   it happens by beholding Him.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   If you've got your Bibles open to that text, you might want to just look across the page
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   or somewhere a chapter later. 2 Corinthians 4.16.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Listen to this awesome statement of the man, the old man.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Paul's getting old here. He's got arthritis maybe, and his back aches,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and his eyes are not so good anymore, and his hearing's not so good,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and he can't walk as far, and he says, "So we do not lose heart,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   though our outer nature is wasting away,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   our inner nature is being renewed." It's the same word from Romans 12.2.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   "It's being renewed every day." Now how? How, Paul?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   How do you as an old man get new every day?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   The answer, "For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Here's the reason. "Because we look not to the things that are seen,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   but to the things that are unseen.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   For the things that are seen are temporary,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Now, here's the key to being new, brothers and sisters.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You want to be new in your mind as a young person,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   in your whole being and spirit as an old person? You want to be new?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Stop watching the world, which very practically comes down to television.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Stop watching the world!
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Why would we want to be entertained by the unbelieving so much?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Why are we so hooked on the video and on the television and on the movies and on the radio?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   World, tell me, show me, feed me, shape me, make me!
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's what we're doing. Oh no, not really.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm not the least affected when I watch.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   You become what you behold.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And I just ask you to compare in your life
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   the degree to which you behold the Lord Jesus and the glory of our God
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   compared to the degree to which you behold the world.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   How do they compare?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Might there not be some insight here as to why we live in weakness and failure in the temptations of our lives?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Why we don't have the effect in the world that we would like to have?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Why our relationships can't be fixed?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Is there perhaps some correlation between the fact that we focus so much on the world,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   we live in the world, we ooze world, we watch world, we read world?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   How many of us read books that have spiritual wisdom?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Look at television that has spiritual wisdom.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Look at movies that have spiritual wisdom.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Read the Bible with its spiritual wisdom.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   How much time do we devote to this biblical principle that is unassailable?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You become what you behold.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I urge you to check out your lifestyle.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Do you want to become holy?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Do you want to become new so that you see like Jesus,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   think like Jesus, feel like Jesus,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   love like Jesus, care like Jesus,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   judge like Jesus?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   If you do, there is an agenda.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Watch Jesus a lot.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Father, I just beg for the miracle of transformation in our lives.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Would you come right now and just convict us and give us some choices about how we spend your Lord's Day afternoon and evening?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Are we really going to go home?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Are we going to spend more time tonight asking the world without any God in it to entertain us?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Then we will reap what we sow.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And I just pray, Father, that that not be so.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   In Jesus' name I ask it.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Amen.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Watch Jesus a lot.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That is not complex, but profound.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   A spiritual battle we must fight out of a firm conviction that we are becoming like what we behold.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Prophetic word for our media diets in the digital age.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Thank you to Ryan, a pastor in Mississippi, who sent this to us.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   The clip was given to him from someone in his church.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So thank you for passing it along to us, Ryan.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   It comes from a 1990 sermon on prophecy of all places, titled "Why the Gift of Prophecy is Not the Usual Way of Knowing God's Will."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Preached on April 1st, 1990.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   If you got one, email me.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Send me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and time stamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Tell me how it impacted you.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   We have eschatology questions coming up on Friday and on Monday.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   First up, a question about the timing of Christ's return and some debates in church history over that timing.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday to talk eschatology.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   [END]
