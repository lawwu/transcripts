[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   - We're honored to be joined again by author
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.020]   and speaker Paul Tripp on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.020]   He is the author of the outstanding book, Sex and Money.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.220]   And in the book you say this,
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.480]   when it comes to sexual temptation, you say,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.820]   "Run from the pride that says you are stronger
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.720]   "than you really are."
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.380]   Wow, explain this pride that says,
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620]   "We are stronger than we really are
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.540]   "in the face of sexual temptation."
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.500]   - Wow, wow, wow, I think this is so important.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.900]   I would say it this way.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.900]   Generally, it's not my weakness that gets me in trouble.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.380]   It's my delusions of strength.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.380]   The Bible is all about the beauty
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.100]   of God's grace for the weak.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.940]   In fact, you could argue that there is no such thing
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.140]   ever considered in scripture as human autonomy
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.940]   and human self-sufficiency.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.900]   I'm neither independent nor self-sufficient.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.160]   So even in the pre-fall condition,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   Adam and Eve were not so powerful as to not need God.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.660]   They were created to be dependent on God.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.980]   Now, we don't like dependency.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.540]   If you're a parent, those arguments your children have
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   with you about what to eat and about what to wear
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.260]   and about when to go to sleep are not about those issues.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.100]   That's that child saying, "You will not rule me.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.360]   "I'm gonna make my own decisions.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   "I'm gonna set my own rules.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.820]   "I'm strong enough and I'm wise enough to do that."
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420]   And so we all do that in some way.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.340]   We all swindle ourselves into thinking
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.980]   that we're wiser, stronger, and more righteous
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.540]   than we actually are.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.840]   And that really makes us susceptible to temptation
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.260]   because we don't prepare ourselves
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.460]   for weakness and foolishness
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.040]   because we don't believe it exists in us.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.060]   Let me say it this way.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.540]   I think this is a practical way of talking about this.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.140]   I think that we're called to live
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220]   in a constant state of prepared spontaneity.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.000]   What that means is I don't know the temptations
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.160]   I'm gonna face today because I'm not sovereign.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm not omniscient.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.220]   I don't see the future,
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280]   but I know everything God says
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.820]   about the fallen world and its dangers.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.380]   And I know everything God says
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.980]   about the sin that's in my heart
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.580]   that makes me susceptible to those dangers.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.580]   So I prepare myself for what I don't know is coming
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.180]   so when it comes, I'm ready.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.540]   And the way that you prepare yourself
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.540]   is you preach yourself a positive theology
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780]   of spiritual weakness coupled with a positive theology
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.760]   of sufficient grace.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960]   And you never stop preaching that to yourself.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.420]   I wanna say what I say all the time.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.680]   No one's more influential in your life than you are
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.580]   'cause no one talks to you more than you do.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.780]   You're in a constant conversation with yourself.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.840]   And that's either a gospel-driven conversation
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.240]   that acknowledges weakness and seeks grace
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.060]   or it's a delusional, self-swindling conversation
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.500]   that promotes delusions of human strength
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.340]   and delusions of human righteousness
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.940]   that sets me up for temptation.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.740]   - That is very humbling.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.560]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.940]   That was Paul Tripp, the author of the book,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.700]   "Sex and Money."

[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.460]   from our lives.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.620]   What is God doing to us in our losses?
