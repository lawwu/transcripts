[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.120]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.940]   And it is almost the new year, which
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.500]   means we should conduct some money-saving tax
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740]   moves to save some money and grow our wealth.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.640]   Taxes are our largest ongoing liability, right?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.800]   Death and taxes, you can't avoid them.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.080]   But we can get smart about our taxes,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.120]   and we can make moves to lower our tax liability.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.240]   The great thing about having multiple income streams,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.820]   as I'm sure all of you guys have, is that-- you know what?
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.800]   We don't rely on one single income to survive.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.600]   But the bad news about having multiple income streams
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.680]   is that we have to do more tax work come year end
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120]   and into the new year.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.560]   So let's talk about some various tax moves we can make.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.360]   Number one, and most obvious, is charitable donations.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720]   Everybody should be feeling more charitable
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.440]   during the holiday season and hopefully
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080]   all throughout the year.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.040]   Being able to give your time and money away to worthy causes
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.000]   is one of the best benefits of being financially independent.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.660]   You no longer feel conflicted about whether you
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.720]   should save and invest your next dollar versus helping someone
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.780]   in need.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.940]   You just kind of do it.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.780]   And being able to spend that time with someone
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.340]   is really, really special.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.860]   So in terms of charitable givings,
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.820]   keep in mind you'll need to itemize deductions
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.020]   and file Form 1040.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.700]   The charity organization must be qualified with the IRS
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.300]   and be actively tax exempt.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.500]   Used items such as housewares and clothing
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.980]   must be in good condition or better
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.500]   for them to be deductible.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800]   So when you're going to Goodwill or the Salvation Army,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.460]   don't just give them a bag of stuff
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.180]   you wouldn't wear because they're
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.180]   dirty or ripped or broken.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.460]   You've got to donate usable items that you
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.100]   would wear or use with pride.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.980]   Donated vehicles can be deducted at fair market value
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.700]   if you meet certain requirements.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.460]   For example, the charity must sell your car
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.860]   well below market price to a person in need.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.060]   If the total of your non-cash contributions
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.180]   is greater than $500, you'll need to file Form 8283,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.300]   which means you have to highlight
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.500]   the details of that giving.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.580]   You'll need a written record of all cash donations
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.900]   with the date, amount, and charity name.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.260]   If you donate $250 or more in cash or property,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.760]   you'll need a statement from the charitable organization
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.780]   detailing your gift and so forth.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.120]   So there are many, many rules.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.500]   But overall, I don't think the IRS is
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.980]   going to nitpick on what you give
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.740]   and what you write as the value.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.500]   Just be as close to the true value as possible.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620]   In terms of giving percentages by rate of income,
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.280]   I thought this was really interesting.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.900]   The average giving percentage as a percentage
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.440]   of total adjustable gross income looks to be around 3%.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.700]   Now, the lowest giving percentage rate
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.020]   is from the income group who make between 200,000 to 250,000
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.020]   at 2.4%, while folks making 45,000 to 50,000 give 4%.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.160]   And then if you move up the income curve to 10 million
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.860]   or more, these folks give away the most percentage at 5.9%
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.420]   and also the most in absolute dollar terms.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.240]   It's interesting that the lowest giving income bracket
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.180]   is the 200,000, basically to the $1 million range.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.820]   I postulate the reason is because between 250,000
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.980]   to a million, you are paying a crap load of taxes
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.540]   based on your W-2 wage.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.260]   The tax system is progressive.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.780]   Top tax rate is 37%, which is lower than the past at 39.6%.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.060]   But still, 37%, then you get state income tax,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.220]   you get FICA tax, and so forth.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.820]   You're probably not as willing to give
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.280]   because you feel like you're getting
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.320]   screwed over by the tax system versus someone
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.180]   who pays little to no income tax or versus someone
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.220]   who's making millions of dollars a year
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.580]   and paying a lower tax rate because most of the income
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.900]   is from long-term capital gains.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.220]   All right, besides charitable giving,
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.660]   we can all capitalize losses on bad investments.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.200]   So if you own securities or property
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.820]   that have been declining and you're below your cost base,
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.620]   consider liquidating before year end
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.940]   if you don't anticipate a recovery.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.580]   So under the tax code, an individual
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.260]   may deduct up to 25,000 of real estate losses per year,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.380]   as long as your adjusted gross income is under 100,000
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.940]   or less, and if you, quote, "actively participate
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.500]   in managing the property."
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.340]   Deduction phase out is when your income approaches 150,000.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.120]   So over 150,000 in income, you're
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.600]   not eligible for these deductions.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.900]   In terms of stock investment losses,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.540]   you're still only allowed to deduct 3,000 a year
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.740]   in capital loss deductions.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.540]   That said, you can just keep on deducting that 3,000 a year
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.020]   every year until it is exhausted.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.620]   So another good tax move is to defer income and itemize
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.820]   deductions.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.180]   So it all depends on how much you plan
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.820]   to make the following year.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.500]   You won't know for sure, but it's good to guesstimate.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.460]   So here are some individual tax moves.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.020]   One, you can make additional contributions to your 401(k)
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.540]   before year end if you haven't maxed them out.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.660]   Two, if you're not subject to AMT,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.700]   you can also consider paying property tax installments
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.620]   and state taxes in the current year that
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.580]   aren't due until next year.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.940]   Accelerating these payments may help you benefit every other
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.820]   year and lower your tax burden for the current taxable year,
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.700]   but you've got to do the calculations based
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.900]   on the new SALT tax deduction limit of 10,000
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.020]   and the standard deduction limit of 12,000 a person.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.680]   They're always changing, folks, so you've
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.460]   got to stay on top of this.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.140]   Three, you can also try asking your employer
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.940]   if they can pay you your year end bonus in the following year
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.100]   if you want to defer income.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.660]   Back when I was working in finance,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.380]   we had the option to defer our entire year end bonus
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.860]   until some later date by one to three years.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.060]   And I never took that option because, well, I don't know.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.620]   Sometimes I am afraid that the company will just
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.700]   go bankrupt or not pay me, and that's something
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.320]   you have to consider as well.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.660]   And then finally, you can consider
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.020]   reinvesting some of your investment proceeds
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.540]   into opportunity zone funds, which
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.620]   may end up being tax free if you hold
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.420]   for the required period of time.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.700]   I think that period of time is 10 years,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.100]   so that's a long time to tie up your capital.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.100]   But after 10 years, and if you make some money
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.420]   and you don't have to pay taxes, that can be a huge win.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.080]   On the business side of things, if you
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.820]   have a business which is cash based, not accrual based,
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.380]   you can defer taxable income to the following year
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.400]   by sending December invoices at the very end of the month.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.060]   The reason this can work is the business won't receive payment
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.440]   for those invoices until January or later,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.060]   and the business's taxable income
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.140]   isn't captured until the date the cash comes in, right?
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.920]   Just got to follow the money, the cash.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.860]   So for me, what I'm doing is I have some checks
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.220]   that I received in December for stuff that I did in November,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.780]   and I'm not going to deposit them in December
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.340]   if I already have a great year.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.700]   I'm going to just wait until January 2nd
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   or whenever the bank's open to deposit those checks.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.900]   Companies and sole proprietors can also
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.820]   reduce taxable income in the current year
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.860]   by charging business related expenses in the fourth quarter
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.740]   that they normally take in the first quarter
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.220]   of the following year.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.100]   So if you expect your business to grow rapidly
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.780]   in the following year, then wait until the following year
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.400]   to load up on capital expenditure.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.700]   In terms of business expenses, if your business
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.800]   needs a vehicle and is also having a great year,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.180]   consider buying a 6,000 plus SUV or truck by December 31st,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.860]   because you can deduct basically all of the expense.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.700]   So let's say you buy a $70,000 Range Rover Sport
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.460]   and use it 100% for business.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.820]   Tax law allows you to deduct 70,000 or a lesser amount
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.580]   if you would like.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.940]   In this case, you'd use section 179 for expensing.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.500]   So you can amortize that expense over a longer period of time.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.340]   If the gross vehicle weight is 6,000 pounds or less,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.340]   your first year write off is limited to 10,000.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.700]   But if you have a luxury auto, there's
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.020]   this bonus depreciation where you can basically
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.700]   deduct 18,000.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.260]   But again, check with your tax accountant.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.500]   Finally, a great private business strategy
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.740]   is to hire a close friend or relative
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.460]   who is in a lower tax bracket than your business tax bracket.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.580]   For example, you could hire your high school son for $3,000
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.380]   to redesign your website, or maybe $3,000
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.860]   to clean your toilets and mop the floors.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.620]   If all he's earning is $3,000 for the year,
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.340]   it's going to be tax free.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.500]   Meanwhile, you reduce your taxable income by 3,000
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.220]   and hopefully get a slick new website or some clean floors
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.780]   out of his labor.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.140]   So this is something that many family businesses do.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.380]   They hire friends and relatives to do work for them,
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.100]   spread that wealth, and reduce their taxable income.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.620]   All right, next, you should also review your flex spending
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.500]   account, the FSA.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.660]   Make sure you don't lose any money in your FSA
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.820]   if you haven't yet spent as much as you anticipated this year.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.500]   Check with your employer if your plan is
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   eligible for a rollover of unused funds
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.900]   until March 15 of the following year.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.140]   If not, you've got to figure something out
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.700]   on how to use that money.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.860]   Surely there is something bothering you
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.500]   that you probably should check out.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.180]   And on the other hand, if you've already
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.020]   run out of the funds in your FSA,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   but have things like medical work or fillings
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   to do at the dentist, try to just postpone them
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.740]   until the next year if they aren't urgent.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.380]   If you're planning on leaving corporate America next year,
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.500]   get your physical done this year.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.100]   It's usually free under preventative care.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.900]   And also consider going to specialists
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.220]   to treat all specific injuries.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.700]   Maybe you need an MRI for a bum knee.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.060]   That's expensive.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.460]   And you're also going to have to pay a co-pay for that.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.420]   Or maybe you should finally see a pulmonologist
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.700]   for your asthma or COPD.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.900]   Whatever the case may be, use your FSA,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.820]   use your health care benefits, and don't let them go to waste.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.680]   Next, consider revising your withholding.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.100]   Even though you probably submitted your W-4 form
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.820]   to your employer ages ago, you can still
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.560]   file a revised form to make adjustments
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.100]   to the remaining pay periods left in the year
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.860]   and for next year.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.900]   So if you anticipate you haven't withheld enough taxes so far
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.980]   this year, you can increase your withholding
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.980]   to help reduce penalties and fees when you file your taxes
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.100]   and also for next year.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.180]   Also check if you've already paid 100% of your current tax
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.740]   liability this year.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.660]   If so, and your AGI is less than $150,000,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.620]   you should be able to avoid being charged a penalty.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.980]   But if not, you need to have paid 110%
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.760]   of your current tax liability in the year
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.320]   to avoid getting dinged if your AGI is above $150,000.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.760]   So this is the safe harbor rule, because the government always
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.040]   wants your money no matter what.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   For 2020, the federal income tax rates don't change,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.400]   but let's just review them real quick.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.120]   If you make between $0 to $9,875,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.620]   your taxable income on the federal level is 10%.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.480]   Now I said that kid, your son, who made $3,000 from your
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.160]   business doesn't pay any taxes.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   And the reason why is because the standard deduction
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.040]   is $12,000.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.680]   So if you make between $9,876 to $40,125,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.980]   the taxable income is 12%.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.360]   And then if you make from $40,126 to $85,525,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.800]   you pay a federal marginal income tax rate of 22%.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.840]   And then from $85,526 to $163,300,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.600]   you pay a tax rate of 24%.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:35.480]   From $163,301 to $207,350, you pay a 32% tax rate.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:44.460]   From $207,351 to $518,400, you pay a 35% tax rate.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.600]   And then for any income above $518,400,
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.080]   you pay a 37% federal marginal income tax rate.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.440]   So I wanted to point out a couple of things.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.700]   One, notice how the tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.640]   And then it jumps to 32%.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.760]   So 24% to 32% is an 8% spread, 8% difference.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.920]   Therefore, I think the optimal gross adjusted income
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.280]   for an individual is about $163,300.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.580]   My question to all of you is, do you really
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.080]   want to pay a 32% marginal federal income tax
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.760]   rate on every dollar you make above $163,300?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.640]   I don't think so.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.120]   I just think that's too much because, well, I
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.960]   live in California.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.660]   So I've got to pay another 6% to 12% state income tax
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.200]   plus FICA tax.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.840]   And then if you look at the tax rates for married couples,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.000]   it's pretty similar except the income levels are double.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.200]   So in other words, the marriage penalty tax
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.640]   has basically been abolished.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.440]   So that threshold for the optimal adjusted gross income
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.520]   for married couples is probably around $326,600
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.580]   because after $326,600, you're paying a 32% marginal federal
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.960]   income tax rate, which, I don't know,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.280]   it just doesn't feel right to me.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.960]   So it's up to you to figure it out.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.480]   And these tax rates are also a good indicator
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.040]   for when you should contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.240]   So if your tax rate is 24% or below,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.960]   it's probably OK to contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.200]   If your tax rate is 32% or above,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.160]   I would definitely not contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.500]   because chances are greater that when you're retired,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.640]   you're going to be making less money than while you're
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   working.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.940]   And if you're at the 32% or higher marginal income tax
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.640]   rate, you're already making a really healthy income.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.280]   So it just makes no sense to pay that higher tax
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.400]   rate when most likely you're going to pay a lower
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.120]   tax rate in retirement.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.520]   So that's about it, folks.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.640]   You've got to know your tax rules.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   Supposedly, the tax code is tens of thousands of pages long.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.480]   And frankly, we all make mistakes.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.280]   I've done my taxes for over 10 years.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.800]   And I'm sure I've made at least one error every single year.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.200]   And the IRS knows that the tax code is complicated
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.440]   and knows that we all make mistakes.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.400]   So they're not like the movies where they're
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.680]   waiting outside your door to audit the crap out of you.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.160]   You just got to know the tax rules, follow the tax rules,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.520]   do your best.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.560]   And if you make a mistake, well, they're
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.880]   going to ask for you to pony up.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.480]   Or maybe they might give you a refund.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.200]   So this year, I actually received, I think,
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.560]   around a $2,500 refund from the state of California
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.640]   because I amended my 2017 tax return.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.120]   But at the same time, I had to pay like $2,000 more
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.200]   to the federal government.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.560]   Whatever the case may be, the IRS figures it out for you.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.200]   You just have to do your best to do your taxes properly.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.960]   If you haven't done your own taxes,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.440]   I highly recommend trying.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.560]   You're going to learn so, so much
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.880]   about how the system works.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.500]   And you're probably going to take steps
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.120]   to optimize the way you earn and also optimize your expenses
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.400]   to reduce your taxable income as well.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.760]   Thanks, everyone, for listening.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.440]   I want to remind everyone that I am not a tax professional.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.800]   I've just been doing my own taxes for decades now.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   And I'm always learning something new.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   And I think it's incumbent on all of us to know the tax code.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.920]   If you want professional tax advice, talk to a professional.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.240]   Double check with someone who does this
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.960]   for a living all day long.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.320]   I just look at this for hours every single year
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.280]   when I do my own taxes.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.320]   Talk to you guys later.
