[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   All right, everybody. As you know, there was a big verdict
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   that came out today in the Trump trial in New York City. However,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.880]   it came right after we were taping. So enjoy this episode.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.400]   And then at the end, we'll go around the horn and get quick
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.040]   reaction from each of the besties on what they think of the
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.000]   Trump guilty verdict in the New York hush money trial. And a
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.480]   little update on the market close and tech stocks tanking
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   and after our trading stick with us, man, what a week I've had.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.000]   Oh, you have an intro I smell an intro.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.320]   What kind of week have you had? You know, I got to, you know,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.600]   I've always been a fan of Howard Stern. And his agent Don Buckwell
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.320]   called me and saw the show last week. This is all true. And they
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.360]   said they want to start a production company. So I started
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.680]   a production company and I've already got my first show. I've
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   signed my first show the pilot. What is the show? Well, here it
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.680]   is. Let me show you. Thanks for asking.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.280]   What you are witnessing is real. These are not actors. The cases
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.520]   are real. Both parties have agreed to settle their disputes
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.280]   here. J Cal production. The Rain Man's court. Yeah. On today's
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.520]   show. Shama guilty of first degree unbuttoning. Freedberg
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960]   accused of plastic perjury. Jason appealing his grifting
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.640]   conviction. Throwing the book felonious Fauci. Welcome to the
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.040]   stand. Judge David Sachs.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.640]   Hot water burn baby. Nice. That's really good. It's the
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.800]   first show from Jacob judge, then what does that make you? Are
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.480]   you like the bailiff? Like kind of like the host? Yeah. Who does
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   American Idol? Right? Ryan Seacrest. I'm like gonna be the
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   new Ryan Seacrest. That's what they envisioned for me. And
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.000]   that's my first spin off show.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   There's a lot of news. My inbox is blowing up. I went over to
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720]   threads to see what was going on over there. And I got absolutely
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   savage. Threads is like all the hall monitors left one school
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.960]   like if they took the four hall monitors from every school in
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   the country and you put them all in one place. That's like
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.320]   Zuckerberg's Twitter revenge killer that he created, but all
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   the journalists and woke folks went there. And then all the
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.840]   conspiracy theories took over x and Twitter and like, freedom of
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080]   speech in one place and then the hall monitors in the other but
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600]   my lord, the inbound I'm getting sacks on apparently you're
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.400]   having a party this Thursday and a couple of people are coming a
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.120]   soiree. What's happening to my birthday party? Oh, yeah. Okay.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.800]   So there's a little soiree happening. sacks enlightening
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   audience. What are you up to?
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400]   We're hosting an event for President Trump.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.840]   Yeah, we're hosting an event for the ones once and future
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.260]   president 45 and 45 soon to be 47. Who's week as I saw from
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.680]   your own polling data that you tweeted this morning, Jason,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.740]   God, it's so dark. It's so dark. He's I mean, the betting markets
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.960]   are just basically they they seem to have already made their
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.480]   decision the betting markets right in the betting markets.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.440]   They're not always right, but they were wrong actually about
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.880]   Hillary Trump. So who knows?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.960]   And polling historically has underestimated Trump support
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   because people have been reluctant to say they're
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.480]   supporting him for some reason. So yeah, things are looking very
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   positive for for Trump right now. But in any event, we're
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.640]   hosting a fundraiser for him. And he said that he wants to
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.720]   come on the all in pod at some point. So we just need to
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.680]   schedule that. And by the way, we did this for let's not
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.960]   forget, we did this for RFK, Jr. Yeah, he appeared on the pod, we
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.600]   did a fundraiser for him. We did it for vague Ramaswamy came on
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.440]   the pod, we did a fundraiser for him. We did it for Dean Phillips.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.680]   And Chris Christie came on, although I don't think we
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.320]   technically did a fundraiser, but we would have. And we've
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.720]   asked President Biden, and we have not heard back. And when we
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.320]   say we, sorry, let me just ask, parse that out. So first of all,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.960]   who's we and Chamath, would you host a fundraiser for Biden as
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.800]   well as Trump?
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   Absolutely. Look, here's the thing. I am an a political
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   person who has to make a difficult decision every four
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   years. And I think most of us are like that. I don't think
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.720]   it's so easy to wake up in the morning and say, Oh, I'm clearly
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.280]   a Republican, or I'm clearly a Democrat, there's parts of both
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.680]   sides that appeal to me. And so you have to make these reason
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.480]   decisions. And then that gets even more complicated, right. So
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.960]   the most important thing for me is get as many people on in a
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.080]   position to tell their version of the truth, so that you can
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   see an unfiltered version of that truth and decide for
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.640]   yourself. So I was really blown away when I heard Dean Phillips,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.400]   and Bobby and I thought there's parts of both of those platforms
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   that I agree with, there's parts that I disagree. And the same
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.200]   thing happened when I sat down with Vivek, I thought that I
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.320]   wouldn't agree with much I ended up agreeing with a lot. There's
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.640]   a lot of stuff that Trump in hindsight, again, as I've said
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.480]   before, that he did, which was really helpful to America. And
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.520]   one big thing, which had he done, frankly, sets up our
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.840]   children, which is these hundred year bonds and defraying the
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.520]   cost of all of this indebtedness far out into the
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.160]   future. So there's many things. And I think there's things that
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.520]   Biden has done that I think we'll look back and say, those
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   were good things that he did. And then there are things in the
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.240]   future, or today that I think that we could disagree with as
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.280]   well. So the point is, I would like this place to be a place
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.600]   where impartiality rules where we can be on all sides of an
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.760]   issue and just decide what makes the most sense after looking at
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.720]   the facts. And I would like four years from now, every major
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.960]   political candidate for president to look at all in as
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.760]   the first place. And I think if we can earn that trust and have
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.440]   the integrity to allow all sides to tell a fair story, that is
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.520]   going to be a really powerful thing, and an artifact to leave
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.360]   behind for people.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.560]   Well, in fact, RFK believes that we shot him out of a cannon is I
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.840]   think what he said or something and that that we got the sort of
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   candidacy going Vivek, I think also kind of debuted here in a
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   major way. To be clear, all in isn't hosting the fundraiser
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   sacks you and Chamath are I'm not donating, I'm not going
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.360]   freebird. You're not donating. I don't know if you're going or
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   not. Did you tell me you're not going? You're not donating or
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.160]   going? Got it. Okay, you wave to Sam. And so I don't know what
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   donates up local Canada's individual choice that each
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.360]   person's got to decide if they want to do it. Right? Americans,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.320]   we can do that. Yeah, if you're willing to open your pocketbook,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.280]   which I know Jason's on something that you're inclined
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.760]   to do very often. I mean, I, I don't, I'm not big into
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.520]   politics. And the idea of giving money to politicians to me, not
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.480]   my thing. You know, I have I'd rather invest in the next
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.880]   startup, to be totally honest, if I'm going to put 50k towards
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.200]   something or God forbid 250k. For me, I'll put that in a
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.720]   startup. That's what I like to do. But you know, everybody's
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.480]   different. And, you know, for the people who are asking me to
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.320]   not be friends with sacks anymore, I'm going to be friends
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.080]   with sacks forever. We love each other besties, and he can have a
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   different opinion than me. I'm getting totally absolutely
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.320]   crucified, that I'm supporting Trump. And how could I be
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.360]   friends with sex? Go yourself, sex is my friend, we can have a
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.200]   difference of opinion on some topics. Good for you to deal
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   with that is good. Learn something. Sorry. Good for you.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.200]   Sorry, I'll just say I've heard the same thing. And I told
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.800]   friends and others that have reached out. Why are you
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.880]   associating yourself with people that are doing a fundraiser for
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   Trump? And I said exactly because I think it's really
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.160]   important that people can have different political interests,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   different points of view, different beliefs, and still be
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.240]   friends and still have a conversation. If we can model
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.840]   that in any way, I think it moves the needle because this
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.760]   whole thing where you only speak with only hang out with only
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.440]   talked to only have dinner with people that you agree with, I
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.120]   think is exactly what got us in the mess that we're in today.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.680]   People need to have a broader perspective. So well said, and
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.080]   I said, and I'll support you guys with whatever, in terms of
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.440]   like being your friends, I'm not going to ever judge you guys in
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   terms of what you believe in or choose to do. We've said this
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   before. But you know, in the end, what do you have, you have
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.240]   your family, you have your children, you have your friends,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.120]   and hopefully you have work that gives you some purpose. And in
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.240]   all of that, if there are random people that are judging you for
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.000]   one thing, they'll eventually judge you for another thing. And
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.400]   that is not a path to any sort of contentment. I've donated to
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.760]   Bobby Kennedy, I've donated to the Democrats massively, and
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.720]   I'll donate to Donald Trump. And if there's an opportunity to
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.520]   talk to President Biden, and really understand where he's at,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.760]   I donate to him as well. And so the point is that I would like
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.120]   to be an organizing principle. And I would like to replace
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.040]   today, the places that I don't trust to organize, and give
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.360]   unfiltered access to knowledge. And those things are the
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   mainstream media. And so I'm willing to put my resources
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.600]   behind being that organizing principle. And I think having a
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.120]   broad cross section of friends who have different political
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.000]   beliefs, is actually a useful thing for a lot of these
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.800]   candidates. Because as it turns out, most people are sort of in
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   the middle. And most people in any given election can be
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.440]   persuaded one way or the other. So the most important thing that
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.320]   we could do is get all of them, give all of them an opportunity
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.240]   to really tell an unfiltered version of their truth, and then
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.880]   let the chips fall where they may, that is the right thing to
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.920]   do for America. That's what democracy means. So this kind of
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   like cajoling and bullying, in either side, I find really
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.040]   distasteful. And I find very immature.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.880]   Yeah, it's not gonna work.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.640]   What's amazing is, I mean, I really haven't gotten any
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.680]   blowback. You know, there was a question about people asked me,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.720]   have you gotten blowback from this thing? And no, not really.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.000]   I mean, other than the reporter knocking on my door and that
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.400]   kind of stuff, but people really same. It hasn't really created
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.160]   blowback. And I think you guys are getting more blowback. And
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.280]   that's an indication of sort of the cowardly response to it,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   which is, you know, it's like a cancellation tactic, we're going
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   to try and like, go behind your back and ostracize you instead
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   of even telling you to your face what you think. And I think the
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.440]   reason why they're doing that is because quite frankly, there's a
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.760]   lot of preference falsification going on in Silicon Valley. I
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.240]   know there's a lot of people in Silicon Valley.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.600]   Who we know, because we know who's coming.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.520]   You have a list of people.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.400]   Nobody is excited about, okay, nobody's excited about Biden
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.560]   right now. So the only question is, do they hold their nose and
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.960]   vote for him? Or do they vote for Trump? Or do they vote for
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.640]   Bobby Kennedy? But there's a lot of people who I do think support
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.800]   Trump. And look, we've a b tested this, right? It'd be
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.720]   different if we didn't have four years of Biden, four years of
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.880]   Trump, there's a lot of people who can look back and say that
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.720]   the AB test we ran indicates Trump. So I know there's going
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.760]   to be a lot of people who support Trump, but they don't
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.040]   want to admit it. And I think that we have this event is going
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.600]   to break the ice on that. And maybe it'll create a preference
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.120]   cascade, where all of a sudden it becomes acceptable to
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.640]   acknowledge the truth. And which is a lot of people support
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.600]   Trump. And it's not just this, it's also Steve Schwarzman came
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.960]   out, I think Bill Ackman's on the edge of coming out for
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.080]   Trump. So there's a lot of people who are now like
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.240]   flipping. And I think it could really start to cascade on
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   itself. I think the thing that hasn't happened yet is we
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   haven't actually now started to talk about the contours of a
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.400]   handful of policy things where there is some deep diversion
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.360]   where these candidates are diverging from each other. And I
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.400]   think that that's going to be really interesting to see how
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.680]   much people value that differentiation. I'll give you
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.600]   an example, which is President Trump in the last few weeks has
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   become incredibly pro crypto. Now, the contours of that, I
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.000]   think we need to define right. But the question is, is a pro
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.520]   crypto environment, especially in a world where we think that
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.560]   there's just going to be continued dollar debasement, an
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.280]   important issue, an unimportant issue, or a thing that is a
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.320]   small issue today, but that will be critical for us in 20 and 30
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.920]   years to get right. That's an example. And there's a handful
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.280]   of these other things that I think that now we have a chance
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.880]   to really double click on, where there really is some
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.920]   differentiation amongst the three presidential candidates.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.360]   And I think that's healthy as well. And so it's important,
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.280]   again, get their specific thoughts on the record, so that
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.720]   we can really figure this out. And I think that over these next
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.400]   few months, I think it's going to be important to do that. So I
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.080]   hope President Biden also comes on the pot quite honestly, and
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.160]   come on the allows us to ask him the hard questions. And I hope
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.600]   Bobby comes back on actually, and I think Bobby will if we ask
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.400]   him just to tighten up where he's at now, a few months.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.080]   But yeah, there's definitely a lot of great follow up
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.160]   questions. I would love to interview Trump. I'll ask him
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.240]   more questions. I'll respect him as President 45. And as a
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.960]   candidate. So for people who like, are like you have Trump
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.160]   derangement syndrome, like, that's just like a childish
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.680]   thing to say, I disagree with his policies. I'll ask him
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   questions. Hey, why don't you support EVs? Like, that's a
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.560]   valid question to ask him? Why is he anti EV? He said all these
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.200]   crazy things about EVs. And then apparently, he's courting you on
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.920]   privately. I don't know if that's true or not. But you
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.760]   know, there's there's hard questions, and I'm sure he'll
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.360]   answer them. And he's more than capable of doing
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.040]   I'm excited for me. I'm really excited for President Trump to
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.840]   come on the podcast.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.640]   And for me, I'll be totally honest. I think the Democrats
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.960]   have to wake up for a second and just like take the temperature
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.240]   of the room, like read the room, Democrats, you have put up a
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.920]   candidate that nobody wants his policies on the border and some
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.440]   other issues are not, you know, in sync with the majority of the
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.200]   country. At some point, the Democrats just have to take a
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.920]   deep look in the mirror. James Carville is doing a bunch of
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.560]   we're doing and say, we feel that a bad candidate who's too
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.600]   old, and people don't believe will stand up to scrutiny of
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.360]   like, say, being on the all in pot for two hours, or in the
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.400]   debates, or with a hostile interview, or any of those
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.040]   possibilities. And so I think if that's the case, we really need
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.280]   to have the Democrats think deeply about maybe fielding a
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.880]   different candidate. And I believe that's what's going to
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.840]   happen in the next 30 to 60 days. So I'm predicting this to
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.040]   be a switcheroo. 100% I mean, if you just really think there's a
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.880]   switch, 100% will be a switcheroo. Who's the
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.160]   switcheroo? I have no idea. Could be Gavin, it could be
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.800]   anybody, anything's possible. I think Trump's going to demolish
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.920]   him in the debate. I think he'll sink to 30% in the polls. And
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.040]   then the Republicans are going to find out I'm sorry, the
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.320]   Democrats will find a way to give him a graceful out and then
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.680]   they'll field somebody else. When's the first debate? June
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.640]   17. I respond to that. I saw your tweet, basically saying
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.920]   something very similar, that Democrats need to wake up and,
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.280]   you know, recognize the situation they're in. I think
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.640]   this is a case of once you've made your bed, you have to
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   sleep in it. Look, the Democrats have set the table pursuing
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.520]   certain policies for the last three and a half years. We've
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.400]   had an open border, we had so much spending that it fed into
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.640]   this inflation with jacked up interest rates. We had Ukraine
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.480]   become the central obsession of focus of our politics, which
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   blew up and Biden's face with the whole summer counter
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.000]   offensive. I mean, I could go on you have the hostility to
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.680]   crypto, which they're now trying to desperately backpedal on but
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.400]   you had three years of Elizabeth Warren and Gensler basically
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.720]   making crypto the enemy. And now all of a sudden, we're at first
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.920]   and go at that like 10 yard line. And you're all of a sudden
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.200]   saying, well, just read the room and make all these changes. You
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.000]   can't. You know, I don't think people are gonna be fooled by
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.600]   that. We've a b tested this thing. We've had three and a
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.680]   half years of Biden, four years of Trump. Who do you like
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.880]   better? And we're what how many months are we from pulling the
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.600]   lever? Five months?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.120]   Never too late. I'm telling him to do it. Don't take sacks as
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.320]   advice. He is a hardcore person who wants to win desperately
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.440]   take Jay cows advice field another candidate. The worst
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.320]   thing the Republicans could ever deal with is a great candidate
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.520]   who can speak and who's nimble on their feet because I think
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.560]   people are looking for a choice that's not these two
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.480]   individuals. I'm not going to say I'm anti Trump. I'm not
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   gonna say I'm anti why don't you support Bobby Kennedy, then? I
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.400]   don't think he's gonna have the platform behind him to get
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.880]   enough votes. I think the Democrats need to immediately
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.800]   this month in June, do the switcheroo. And if they do, I
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.160]   think they went in the lens. They had their chance. They had
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.360]   their chance. They could have gone for Bobby. They drove Bobby
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.320]   out of the party. That's not your only reason. You didn't
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.920]   start as an independent. He started I know by his last
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.640]   name, Democrat, Democrat. You got it. Phillips. Yeah, Dean
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.400]   Phillips took the chance. Yeah. And of course, he was pushed
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.920]   out, not of the party, but basically ostracized. They had
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   their chance.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.040]   I think you know, if I want to be a strategist, this is just a
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.400]   conspiracy theory. I don't want to go to like, tinfoil hat
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   corner. I think the Democrats as cynical as it sounds, we're
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.640]   waiting to see what happens with this Trump trials conviction
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.280]   what you call lawfare, what other people call fair use of
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.800]   the law. And then they are going to see how he does in the
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.240]   debates. That's why they moved the debate up in June. And I
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   think they know to pull the plug on this if it gets too far gone.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.560]   And they have the ability to do that. Because all he's got to
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.160]   say is, you know what, I'm feeling old. And I want us to
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   win. And I'm going to slot somebody else in. But listen,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.080]   let's go get to this.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.520]   Yeah, let me translate what you just said, which is the
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.640]   Democrats hope to put Trump in jail using lawfare. And when
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.840]   that fails, they realize that they're going to lose the
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.040]   election to him. And they've got a big problem. So they're going
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.320]   to try some desperate strategy to find a new candidate, but
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.320]   it's way too late for that.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.800]   I think precisely.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.120]   Thank you for repeating. And I think the only disagreement we
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.840]   might have there is, I would agree like there's lawfare in
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.760]   two of the cases. And I think two of the cases, I think are
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.480]   should be pursued. But you know, we can intelligent people, as we
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   said at the start of this can agree to disagree about it. And
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.920]   I think you should all take if you're a listener says podcast,
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.280]   you're smart. If you're here, you're smart. You're not
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.720]   listening to two hour podcasts. With us going this deep on
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.640]   issues if you're not a brilliant, smart, and attractive
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.200]   individual. So let's get to the docket. President. Yes, that's
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.400]   what I just said. He heard brilliant and attractive and
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   was here. All right, listen, I, I hate to go into another
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.520]   controversial topic. But the four of us were all on fire
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.240]   about this. Apparently, the COVID-19 investigation is
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.160]   leaning towards a massive cover up. There's a subcommittee
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.680]   going on right now, the world's not paying attention to
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.080]   this. But I think some savvy people are, especially over on
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.360]   x is a lot of great journalists who are doing incredible
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.880]   investigative work. Let me just catch everybody up in the
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.320]   audience real quick here and get the best is involved. Over the
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.360]   past year and a half, how subcommittee has been focused on
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.840]   the origins of COVID-19. And they've been investigating the
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.760]   NIH is ties with gain of function research in Wuhan. The
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.560]   subcommittee was painted early on. It's like this is angry
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.400]   Republicans, this is about mask mandates, it was like highly
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.520]   politicized, but it's actually turned out to be very effective
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.680]   bipartisan investigation, we'll get on, we'll get in on that in
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.480]   a minute. But so far, most of the investigation is focused on
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.360]   nailing down this timeline of communication between NIH
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.320]   officials, and an organization called Eco Health Alliance. This
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.400]   is a nonprofit that's focused on infectious disease research. Now,
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.440]   these committee videos online will pay you play on in a
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.320]   moment. But through funding in the NIH, the Eco Health
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   organization was awarded research grants to various labs.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.920]   This included the Wuhan Institute of virology, the
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.600]   infamous one, Eco Health violated terms of its grants by
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.240]   failing to report that gain of function experiments were being
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.720]   conducted in Wuhan, Eco Health was supposed to report any
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.800]   experiment that exhibited characteristics leading it to
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.520]   being 10 times more infectious. But when that happened, it failed
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.120]   to disclose this research to the NIH. And on May 17, a deputy
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.680]   director of the NIH acknowledge that the agency funded gain of
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.240]   function research in Wuhan via Eco Health. This is the key
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.080]   because Fauci initially denied this during his 2021. Senate
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.000]   hearing, Fauci said, quote, I totally resent the lie you are
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.720]   now propagating in response to questions from Rand Paul about
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.000]   the lab leak theory. So Fauci either didn't know or relied
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.080]   under oath. Let me pause there for a second. There's a lot more
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.880]   to the story. But when you hear this sort of setup, Friedberg,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.760]   our sultan of science, in this initial setup, what rings
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.800]   concerning to you true to you, and then we'll go on and play
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.360]   some clips of this testimony, which is pretty wild.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.480]   I don't think that pre emergence of the pandemic that there was
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.120]   nefarious motives.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   In other words, their funding of this was not done to create a
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.080]   pandemic. It might have been a mistake in hindsight. But
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.840]   yeah, for many years, particularly following the
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.320]   original SARS pandemic, there was a lot of conversations
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.200]   around how do we get in front of the next pandemic? How do we
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.960]   figure out what's coming? And how do we prepare for it? And
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   there was a lot of research that was launched to try and resolve
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.720]   that key question. This is like the movie 12 monkeys. You guys
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:44.600]   ever see that movie? It's like, does the effort to try and stop
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.680]   the problem cause the problem? I think that for my point of view,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.320]   there's a very high probability that there was some leak. That
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.920]   meant that the work that was going on to try and get in front
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.840]   of the next pandemic and understand what we could do to
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.240]   prepare ourselves and what vaccines can be developed and so
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.920]   on, actually led to the pandemic. So then when that
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.280]   happens, how do you respond when you're sitting in that seat?
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.680]   That's, that's the key question that I think this committee is
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.000]   uncovering. Do you think there was a cover up? Freeberg? What
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.320]   is your intuition on that? Yeah, I think that these guys
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.520]   definitely didn't want. I think what they were trying to do was
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.960]   prevent that from being the focal point and protect their
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.760]   own asses at the same time. Do you think they should go to jail?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.800]   I don't know the extent of it yet. It'd be good to get more
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.920]   information from this. Yeah. So let me queue up those next
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.600]   details. Because I will say this guy that gave testimony last
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.000]   week, where he was like, deliberately changing the names
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.200]   of people in the email, Anderson, and he put the dollar
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.920]   sign, right, so that you couldn't find that email when
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.680]   you did a FOIA search. He knew what he was doing. He knew. I
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.160]   don't understand how you could say this wasn't nefarious. This
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.200]   whole thing was nefarious from top to bottom.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.960]   Well, yeah, let me queue this up here, Saxon, then get your Why
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.560]   are you exonerating it? Hold on, let me queue it up. Right. So we
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.000]   started to see some consequences and accountability. Last week,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.240]   the US Department of Health cut all funding to EcoHealth in
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.640]   response to the committee's investigation. They disbarred
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.760]   its president, Peter Daszak. Daszak, yeah. Daszak. And so we
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.320]   don't have direct evidence to be clear that the pandemic was the
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.680]   result of a lab leak. And, you know, just even saying the lab
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.240]   leak here, we would have gotten this.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.200]   The fear and cleavage site makes it clear that this was a lab
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   leak. That's not a naturally occurring virus. The fear and
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.240]   cleavage sites were engineered.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.480]   Let's go to that in just one second. And thankfully, this
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.360]   isn't going to get our YouTube channel shut down because we
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.920]   have freedom of speech back a little bit. But this is where it
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.480]   gets really interesting. Emails were written as EcoHealth with a
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.760]   tilde, that's that little squiggly line, instead of an O.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.880]   And they would spell Anderson with a dollar sign in the E.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.400]   Christian Anderson, in this example, is a biologist who was
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.960]   reportedly awarded 9 million in grants from the NIH two months
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.480]   after publishing a paper claiming didn't COVID did not
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   come from a lab. And so let's get to some of these clips.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.320]   Here's a clip of Fauci's former top advisor, David Morin's
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.600]   getting grilled in the hearing. And I'll play two clips, and
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.200]   then I'll give it to you.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   On October 25, 2021, another scientist wrote, quote, David is
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.120]   concerned about the privacy of text and other messages from his
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.160]   cell phone to you and me because he has been using a government
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.240]   phone. This came from Tony, end quote. Sir, did you ever have any
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.040]   conversations with Dr. Fauci regarding using personal phone
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.600]   or email to communicate with Dr. Dasik?
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.720]   I don't remember it. It's possible. You know, I probably
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.320]   wouldn't have remembered and I don't remember it.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.480]   On January 18, you testified that you did not have any
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.120]   conversations with Dr. Fauci regarding EcoHealth. On October
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   25, 2021, you wrote, quote, Peter, from Tony's numerous
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.880]   recent comments to me, they're trying to protect you, end
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.400]   quote. You meaning EcoHealth and Dr. Dasik. Dr. Morin, did you
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.480]   ever have any conversations with Dr. Fauci regarding EcoHealth?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.440]   Well, the ones you just mentioned, I don't have any
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.360]   recollection of that.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.280]   No recollection.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.960]   No recollection. No.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.000]   All right, so we're on the no recollection train. And then
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.320]   I'll give this final clip here. This is unbelievable, Sachs.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.080]   Currently, there's a FOIA leader, lady, Freedom of
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.480]   Information Act lady, working at NIH to train and help and mentor
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.600]   people on how to avoid having their communications. These are
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.320]   people who we work who work for us. And she's the FOIA lady at
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.120]   NIH. Play the clip, Nick.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.080]   And as you've said, you previously testified that you
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.520]   did not delete any federal records. But on February 24,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.040]   2021, you wrote, quote, I learned from our FOIA lady here
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.200]   how to make emails disappear after I'm FOIA'd, but before the
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.240]   search starts. So I think we are all safe. Plus, I deleted most
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.360]   of those earlier emails after sending them to Gmail, end
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.560]   quote. And the next day on February 25, 2021, you wrote,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.720]   quote, but I learned the tricks last year from an old friend,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   Marge Moore, who heads our FOIA office and also hates FOIAs,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.320]   end quote. Yes or no? Is Marge Moore the FOIA lady you're
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   referring to?
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.680]   She was at the time. I believe she's retired since then.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.920]   Did the NIH FOIA office instruct you on how to delete emails or
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   avoid FOIA?
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.440]   No.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.400]   All right, Sachs. There's your red meat. Smoking guns
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.280]   everywhere. What do you think?
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.760]   Please give me a couple of minutes to kind of lay out what
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   happened here. Okay, so Fauci knew very early, as early as
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.480]   February 1 of 2020, that COVID came from a lab leak. The
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.240]   scientists said so. All they had to do was look under a
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.920]   microscope and see the furon cleavage site, which is not
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.080]   naturally occurring. It's something that was added,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.240]   basically bioengineered to the virus in order to make it more
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   transmissible in humans. So they knew right away that this
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.120]   somehow came from a lab leak. And Fauci and Collins said in
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.960]   emails that they were going to begin a brutal takedown in order
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.640]   to conceal this fundamental truth of the lab leak from the
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.000]   public. Now, why would Fauci need to conceal this? Because he
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.680]   had funded gain-of-function research programs via Peter
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.120]   Daszak and the EcoHealth Alliance to conduct, again,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.280]   gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.600]   Moreover, Fauci was personally responsible for reversing an
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.240]   Obama-era decision to prohibit gain-of-function research
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.320]   because it was so risky. Fauci wrote op-eds justifying
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.640]   gain-of-function research. He wrote a paper in 2012, which was
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.880]   actually quite candid about the risks of gain-of-function. He
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.320]   describes the kind of lab leak that could occur in the type of
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.840]   virus that could escape from a lab because of gain-of-function.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.200]   But then he says that's a risk worth taking. So this is
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.720]   somebody who funded the Wuhan lab. He funded gain-of-function
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.880]   research. He was personally responsible for lifting the ban
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.560]   on gain-of-function research. He had a lot of reasons to want to
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   hide the fact that COVID was engineered in a lab and was lab
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.040]   leak. And so we know that even before this conspiracy to
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.440]   basically defraud the FOIA request, that Fauci had done
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.400]   things like organize that letter to the Lancet, which smeared and
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.800]   demonized scientists who were trying to tell the truth, saying
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.280]   that the so-called zoological theory was nonsense, this had to
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.320]   be from a lab. He was doing things like this. And now we
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.440]   have this added piece, which is this longtime colleague of
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.760]   Fauci and Collins at NIH, Dr. David Morens, developed a
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.600]   strategy for evading FOIA requests that would expose the
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.400]   truth. He did this by deleting government emails, which is a
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.520]   crime, by using private email to conduct government business,
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.640]   which is also a crime, and then strategically misspelling names
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.000]   and titles to frustrate the FOIA searches. And then the craziest
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.760]   part is that Morens foolishly detailed his schemes in emails
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.840]   that Fauci would have seen that Fauci was on the distribution
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.360]   list stuff. So he has no plausible deniability.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.560]   It's literally like they're like, here's how we can avoid
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.160]   getting caught in an email.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.720]   You have to see the FOIA piece within the overall picture here,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.440]   which is Fauci from the get go was lying about the origins of
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.520]   COVID in order to cover up his role in funding this type of
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.920]   research. Yes. And there was a comprehensive effort by people
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.960]   at NIH, likely at Fauci's direction, to again, not just
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.760]   cover this up, but to smear scientists
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.800]   who were on the offensive, in addition to trying to cover
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.960]   their, their asses.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.680]   People like Jay Bhattacharya, who then got censored and banned
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.560]   on social media.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.280]   By the way, who is a Stanford professor was banned for
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   speaking up Chamath, let's zoom out here and start thinking
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.640]   strategy and theories of what's going on here. I have my own,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.880]   but I'm curious to hear yours first as we go around the horn
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.080]   here. What's your take on this?
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.320]   I would like to make four points, I think that kind of
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.720]   summarize my view of this, I think what happened here needs a
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:15.880]   really clear accounting, because the implications are far greater
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.960]   than I think people realize. And I think why maybe the four of us
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.560]   have have always been tugging on this little thread is because
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.960]   each of us instinctively understood that. So the first is,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.840]   if you just look at the macro economic consequences of what
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.760]   COVID did, and our reaction, we broke the seal of having
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.080]   absolutely no accountability on massive spending, right? So there
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.720]   are subsidies, there are kickbacks, there are government
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.760]   programs that now number in the trillions of dollars a year
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.960]   incremental to what we were going to spend if things were
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.760]   the status quo. And the problem is that in Freiburg has talked
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.920]   about this really eloquently in the past, it's creating a
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.840]   massive debt issue that us and our children and our
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.320]   grandchildren will have to deal with. If we had responded to
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.720]   this pandemic differently, those issues would not have occurred.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.120]   If we had just kept the economy open, because we understood what
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.480]   was going on. We would not have reacted the way that we did. And
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.200]   we would not have nearly as much debt as we had. And we would not
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.080]   have made it okay for politicians to spend trillions
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   of dollars. That is a direct consequence of our reaction to
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.720]   COVID, not COVID itself. The second is we caused billions of
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.800]   people all around the world to take immaturely tested drugs.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.560]   They were called vaccines, we found out that they were modestly
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.600]   effective at best. And then some of them were designed in some
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   ways to manipulate our DNA. And we just don't know what the
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.800]   long term impacts will be. We see some small issues of
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.840]   myocarditis, we see other issues of all cause mortality. But the
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   point is, we just don't know. And that would not have happened
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.040]   had we not rushed to force people to stand in the line and
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.840]   get a jab in order to get back to their normal life. That was a
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.520]   direct consequence, not of COVID. But of a reaction. The
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.840]   third is what we're realizing right now is that we had this
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.680]   power drunk apparatchik. And this is similar to the quote
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.880]   that Mike Pompeo made, when he took over the CIA. What he found
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.600]   and he said this after when he left was, there were people on
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.440]   the top floor of the CIA building, the seventh floor of
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.680]   the Pentagon, that fundamentally believed that it wasn't the
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.400]   Democrats nor the Republicans that ran the country, but it was
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   them. And I see a similar level of arrogance here, which is this
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.160]   belief that they know better. And so what they did was they
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.760]   committed the greatest sin, which is where the cover up is
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.600]   way greater than the crime. And they created a setup where all
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.480]   of these things were amplified by their prestige, their
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.160]   perceived scientific knowledge. But what they were really doing
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.720]   was keeping critical information to themselves, and then trying
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.360]   to cover it up, Jason, that is so unacceptable when you think
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.440]   of the broad consequences of what happened. And that's what
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.960]   needs to get documented. And I do think there needs to be some
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.240]   form of accountability for that.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.000]   I think as well said, and you know, just looking at it, I
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.480]   think we are now at the part point of this conversation and
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.760]   investigation, we can say this is not a bipartisan, this is an
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.880]   issue. And everybody knew like, we had these conversations on
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.920]   this very podcast, the public knew something didn't seem right
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.200]   about this. And if you just think about this from first
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.920]   principles of what occurred here, just what occurred here.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:47.280]   Freeberg, we funded gain of research to create these
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.960]   super viruses that what I think other people could just as
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.080]   equally call a bio weapon with the Chinese. Now, we're supposed
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.400]   to be arch rivals here were like these competitors. And then when
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.280]   it came out, and it leaked, and of course, I don't think it was
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.360]   released on purpose. When it came out, the people who work
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.760]   for us and we trust with our family safety, who funded this
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.280]   in order to save their own reputations to cover their
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.240]   asses, then lied about it. And then, like, as you said, sex,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.720]   perfectly, they were on the offensive. These people were
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.640]   not elected by anybody. That's right. These people work for us.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.360]   And they failed us. This is a crime against humanity of the
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.360]   greatest cause. People committed suicide, people died, because
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.280]   they had depression, our kids lost two years of school, this
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.920]   generation has lost their education. And now we have
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.880]   burdened them with billions, hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.480]   in debt from this. This is trillions, trillions, trillions,
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.640]   10s. This is a failure of leadership. It is a crime. And
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.360]   when people said prosecute Fauci, they were like, you're
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.320]   being hysterical. This is ridiculous. These people need to
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:10.080]   be prosecuted. If you hit this stuff, from a FOIA request, you
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.160]   need to go to jail. There needs to be accountability here. I
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.520]   think what they did to society, our children in the future, I
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.120]   am infuriated by this.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.040]   Imagine what happened in the situation room or the equivalent
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.400]   wherever the President of the United States, all these world
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.800]   leaders were coalescing to try to make decisions in that
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.200]   period. They all looked at this quote unquote expert, they
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.960]   pointed at Fauci and said, lead us out. And so do we not think
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.560]   that at any point he was thinking, how do I do this in a
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.080]   way where I have no fingerprints? Clearly the answer
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.240]   is, in fact, he was leading from a position of how will I not
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.120]   have any fingerprints on this? And so do we did we get the best
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.800]   advice? on the margin? I think it's pretty fair to say we
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.880]   could not have gotten it because he was too conflicted. He was
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.280]   figuring out how to cover up what happened, as opposed to
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.840]   just own it and then help the world get out of it.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.800]   Yeah, I mean, talk about like incinerating your entire career
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.320]   legacy. But putting that aside, the morality of covering this
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.560]   up. And, you know, so then you have to think trauma. And this
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.800]   is why I was like, what is the strategy? What goes through
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.320]   somebody's mind when they decide to do a cover up this level? Is
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.120]   it just fear of getting caught, and their lives being in their
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.880]   mind ruined, and they're going to do this incredible cover up?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.680]   I actually think that they thought this would become a
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.320]   globally destabilizing moment between the United States and
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   China. And that there could be revolutions. Now, I know that
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.960]   this is now sounding really conspiracy theory. But if you're
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.120]   sitting there, and you're like, what if the public finds out we
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   created this, and their grandparents died from it, and
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.600]   their kids didn't go to school because there'll be riots in the
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.200]   street. But if enough time passes, maybe there's not riots
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.920]   in the street. Well, you know what, this is something that is
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.620]   just so abhorrent. That I mean, people need to really be held
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.240]   accountable. freeberg your thoughts. What would you guys do
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.760]   if you're sitting in a policymaker seat today? And
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.320]   you're being offered by scientists, this ability to go
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.960]   and figure out what the next big virus will be, and start to make
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.880]   plans for getting in front of it by understanding the biology of
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.960]   these viruses by seeing where they're going to evolve to, and
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.820]   by trying to get in front of the next pandemic so that we can
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.800]   protect the population? Do you guys support that sort of
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.200]   research? And what are the questions you ask? So let's, you
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.340]   know, rewind 15 years, pretend Fauci doesn't get to make those
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.780]   decisions. You guys are the policymakers. And folks say SARS
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.700]   just happened. We want to do this research. We want to figure
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.060]   out how to get free to do and how do you how do you answer
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.340]   that?
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.820]   There's a really simple. There's a really simple question
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.300]   of anybody who's watched any kind of science fiction or knows
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.620]   the history of this kind of research, which is don't do this
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.980]   in a population center. And what how will you prevent it from
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.380]   breaking out? Like, literally, that's job one, if you're going
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.000]   to, even if you're not going to, like, literally, every science
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.060]   fiction film, it's so it's like, put it on an island. And there's
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.960]   an island off Long Island where they keep these things. I forgot
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.560]   the name of it is Plum Island or something. We'll look it up.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.640]   Yeah. And by the way, there, there are internal NIH emails
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.560]   that suggest that COVID leaked from a level two facility, they
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.920]   call it BSL two, which does not operate with the top level
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.300]   biohazard safeguards. So they knew the Wuhan lab was not at
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.360]   the level of safeguards that it should have been. But look, I
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.300]   would go deeper and say that why would you do this kind of
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.360]   research at all? I mean, you are deliberately manipulating viruses
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.500]   in order to make them transmissible in humans. This was
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.960]   a bat virus that was not transmissible to humans. It was
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.920]   bioengineered, they add the furin cleavage site to allow it
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.640]   to gain access to human cells.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.600]   Yeah. So sex, I am going to push back because that is not
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.560]   conclusively true. What you're saying is something that some
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.440]   people have claimed, but there are other scientists, including
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.600]   papers published recently in the Lancet, and other like pretty
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.680]   reputable, like medical journals and research journals that
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.560]   indicate that the evolution seen in the fear include cleavage
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.660]   site can be traced back to an evolutionary origin, not
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.900]   necessarily to a human engineered origin. So I want to
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.560]   just make that clear that that is a possibility. Okay, I'm not
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.800]   dismissing it. But I'm not supporting the other side. I'm
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.040]   saying we have work to do to figure this out. Okay, to be
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.400]   clear.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.640]   It's a possibility that's so remote. I mean, look, I heard
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.380]   Professor Jeffrey Sachs talking about this in a recent
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.420]   interview, and he went through the whole history. So there's
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.200]   like 200 of these coronaviruses in this like class or category.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.460]   And there's not one furin cleavage site among any of them.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.240]   So can you say that there's not a one?
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.680]   Yeah, it happened.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.600]   It's a very, very, very low probability.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.840]   Let me punch up your question for a bird. Because if you have
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.720]   your question is, what should you do? I want to ask you guys,
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.080]   what do you do? So like, forget about Oh, there's bad guys,
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.880]   Fauci is a bad guy, like, what do you do to protect the world
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.480]   against the next pandemic?
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.160]   Number one, you don't do this type of gain of function
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.900]   research. Number two, if you are going to do it, you don't do it
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.920]   at a level two facility like the Wuhan lab. Number three, when the
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.760]   virus leaks from the lab, you don't basically lie about and
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.280]   conduct a cover campaign that smears reputation of honest
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   scientists. Number four, when you're hauled into the Oval
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.400]   Office in response to this once in a century pandemic, you don't
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.560]   pretend like you're America's doctor, and you have all the
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.400]   answers. And in fact, you're the guy who created this problem.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.840]   You own it. There's an idea you own it. And you know what, like
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.440]   the question really embedded in your question freeberg, I think
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.480]   is, is gain or is there any argument to doing gain of
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.720]   function? If so, how? And then is there any reason to research,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.800]   you know, the bat dung or whatever material they get it
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.120]   from, you know, from those caves and take it out of the caves? I
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.520]   could see the latter trim off of like, hey, this existed nature,
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.120]   you study it on an island somewhere far away from
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.080]   everybody with massive controls. The gain of function seems like
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.160]   it literally feels like the speech from Jurassic Park, like,
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.080]   I think it's not would you took place on an island for a reason.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.160]   There were many scientists who are opposed to gain function
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.520]   research, they thought it was unduly risky and didn't have
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   offsetting benefits. And that is exactly why Obama banned it very
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.960]   good decision. To me, this whole idea that we need to amplify
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.680]   these viruses in order to find out what would happen if this
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.160]   happened naturally is insane. You didn't have this during until
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.840]   you created it. Yes, this is not this is nuts.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.400]   Greg, there are there are examples we know, I'll just
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.000]   point to two. Let's just say the attempted overthrow of the
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.360]   Ukrainian government in 2014. You can go back to Iran
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.480]   contrast yet another example. And you can add gain of function
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.160]   research now, which is again, I'll just go back to when there
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.800]   are these lifelong bureaucrats that believe they're above the
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.600]   law, that there's this sensation that they can pull the levers of
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.400]   power silently behind the scenes, because they know better.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.200]   And then what they're doing, as you guys said, is they are
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.120]   controverting the desires of the people. So whether you like
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.440]   President Obama or not, he's duly elected by the people. And
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   when he says this isn't allowed, it shouldn't be allowed. And
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:27.080]   when you instantiate chaos and wars and all of this other
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.680]   stuff, overthrows and all of these other places that then
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.120]   create all these long tail effects. They're not done with
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.200]   really America support, they're done by a small group of people
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.680]   who think they know better. And I think that we've created that
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.240]   kind of a problem that needs to get fixed. And so I think that
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.360]   there, this has to be an example where you can make them an
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.440]   example, because otherwise it will keep happening. And there
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.320]   are other parts of the American bureaucracy, where people are
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.760]   in charge of very critical and important decisions. And I
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.520]   suspect 99% of them are good, earnest, honest people doing the
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.960]   right thing for America. But it's just the law of large
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   numbers, there will be one or two, and all it takes is one or
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.600]   two, who get drunk with that power. And so unless that
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.320]   there's a check and balance on that dynamic, we'll have more
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.440]   issues of this. And as the world gets more sophisticated, and we
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.240]   rely more on experts, I hate to say this, guys, but you have to
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.120]   be more skeptical of experts. As much as you think an expert is
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.160]   an expert, you have to fight the tendency of saying I'm going to
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.280]   abdicate all of my intellect onto you and you decide, yeah, I
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.960]   think you have to find a way of just gut checking. And SAC said
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.600]   this critical thing. If I was the President of the United
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.920]   States in a pandemic, I didn't need the COVID to teach me this
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.760]   example. But if I'm trying to solve a very technical and hard
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.280]   engineering problem, what I always do is I bring a cross
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.200]   section of people in a room. Typically, some of them have to
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.040]   have disagreeing opinions, and I make them intellectually fight
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.680]   it out. And my job is to observe. And in that I apply my
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.400]   judgment. I'm not nearly as smart as them. I'm not nearly
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.440]   technically as trained as them. But that is a process that
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.320]   works. And I'm just questioning, it couldn't have happened here.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.160]   Because as SAC said, if you basically bury the reputations
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.880]   of the folks that are pushing back, you could never bring them
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.920]   inside the room in the oval and have a conversation with them
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   and say, Hey, Jay Bhattacharya, give us the red team version of
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.800]   what you think is happening. Yeah. And that is a real
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   argument, steel man, the opposite side.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.880]   Let me build on a point Chamath made, which is, I think we have
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.440]   to ask the question, what type of government do we really have?
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.120]   You know, we call ourselves a democracy, but are you a
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.280]   democracy when the elected leaders come and go, and the
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.000]   really powerful bureaucrats running the government running
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.600]   these agencies stay for decades and decades. And if the
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.320]   president disagrees with their policy, they can just wait them
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.640]   out. Fauci wanted to do gain of function research, maybe, by the
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.880]   way, at the behest of God, we don't know could have been a
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.160]   bio weapon or bio defense program. There's a lot more to
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.200]   this that we don't even know about yet. In any event, it's
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.640]   clear he was passionately committed to funding gain of
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.840]   function research. He just waited for his opportunity and
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.760]   implemented as well. Victoria Nuland in the State Department,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.800]   passionately committed to basically bringing Ukraine into
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.280]   NATO, and using that to essentially provoke a regime
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.120]   change operation in Russia. Again, she just had to wait for
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.240]   her opportunity to basically keep pushing these policies for
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.800]   decades. These are the people who are really running the
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.080]   government. How would you change it? We have to turn these
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   things over these organizations or get rid of them.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.480]   We talk about term limits for politicians, maybe we actually
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.680]   need to turn the limits for the administrative apparatchik that
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.840]   runs all these critical organizations.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.240]   Right. It's called the deep state, right? You ever hear the
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.880]   expression deep state sounds conspiratorial. It's not, it's
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.560]   just the permanent bureaucracy. We elect a president, but but
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.720]   how many people does the President actually appoint a
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:08.080]   couple 100? You're 99.9% of the people running the government
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.120]   are there permanently.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.520]   Well, and then I'll just say here, I want to give a shout out
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.440]   to the journalists, Catherine bond and Catherine bond and
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.480]   Emily comp, I know that people also have no faith in
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.240]   journalists. These are two journalists, I think you could
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.880]   have tremendous faith in and we're going to win Pulitzer's
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.040]   because they've been doggedly pursuing this. And you have to
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.000]   wonder why this is not the top story on the news networks and
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.360]   why this isn't the head of, you know, the New York Times or the
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.200]   Washington Post, like there needs to be much more coverage
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.800]   of what's going on here. I don't understand.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.400]   Yeah, because the Trump takes every headline.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.480]   Yeah. I don't think it has anything to do with Trump. I
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.240]   think it's got everything to do with the fact that the New York
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.480]   Times was covering for Fauci. Fauci has been there. Fauci has
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.840]   been there for decades. He is a major source of the New York
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.200]   Times, just like he was a major funder of grant programs, right.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.360]   So there's a lot of people who have developed a dependency on
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.240]   Fauci. I mean,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.560]   for information, you think access journalism is what's
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.840]   going on here. He gave them access.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.080]   There's no question. Times was covering for this. The New York
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.280]   Times definitely promoted the idea that anyone pushing the
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.200]   lab leak theory was somehow conspiracy theorist or not.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.480]   And you have to lay on top of all this acts. It's a political
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:18.880]   environment.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.280]   They were pushing that whole crazy wet market theory.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.640]   Well, the wet market theory,
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.680]   the pangolin. Remember the pangolin?
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.840]   We needed Jon Stewart to dismantle the pangolin theory.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.360]   You know, in relation to that, these wet markets have spread
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.480]   massive viruses and, you know, all kinds of things. And they do
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.680]   need to be, there was like a UN report on like, hey, we have to
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   upgrade because people have to stop doing live markets.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.520]   That's why it was a great cover story.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.440]   I think it was a logical theory to pursue to the end point of
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.120]   eliminating it because they around Wuhan, there are a lot of
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.920]   these wet markets. It is completely conceivable that a
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.680]   person who was in that lab went to a wet market and it spread
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.320]   via the wet market. This is why we need a full investigation,
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.880]   folks, because all these theories could come together.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.760]   And there are more cards to turn over, which one of you
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.960]   alluded to, like, who knows what the turn in the river are
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.160]   going to be here? Like, what did China know? What did our
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.600]   government and China know? Maybe they are making bioweapons.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.720]   Maybe they're doing even worse stuff that we don't know about.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.280]   Maybe there's all kinds of rogue programs that are being that
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.920]   are occurring here. That's why we need to keep digging and
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   digging. The American public must hold these people
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.680]   accountable. And they need to tell us who else was involved.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.840]   Because if Fauci is involved, and this guy's involved, there's
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.160]   other people. I want to hear from everybody.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   There's many crazy parts of this. But I think maybe the
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.200]   craziest part of the whole thing is that when the pandemic
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.800]   happens, and the elected government of the United States,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.840]   the President needs to pull in the resources to manage a
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.280]   policy response, who do they pull in? Fauci, the guy who
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.400]   created the problem. It's kind of like when they have Newland
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.720]   be our chief diplomat in the State Department, and she's
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.000]   fomented the coup in Kiev in 2014. It's again, these, these
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.640]   bureaucrats are doing the exact opposite of what they're
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.120]   supposed to be doing. They're not being honest. Yes. But I
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.040]   think to answer your question, what do we do about it? I think
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.680]   we just got to clean out the stables here. Yeah, I think we
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.000]   just got to disband some of these government departments.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.320]   Why do we have so many this whole alphabet soup of three
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   letter agencies? I think Vivek Ramaswamy had the right idea.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.680]   Let's just get rid of a bunch of these things.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.520]   zero based budget, the whole government start over. Yeah,
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.000]   and just go right through each one. Like if and you know what,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.480]   it should be a bipartisan issue. But there's so much money
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.400]   involved. This is one of the challenges in the capitalist
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.880]   system. Is there so much money, there's so much grift to go
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.320]   around that when something like this happens, and there's an
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.160]   opportunity to I don't know, make a vaccine and, you know,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   put a couple of billion dollars into this lightspeed thing,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.480]   which was a great idea. Seemingly, everybody lines up,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.080]   okay, yeah, sure, we'll get involved. We'll take some of
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.200]   that money. Yeah, buy a billion shots from us. President Trump
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.520]   was really on to this, because he's the one that really coined
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.400]   the term the deep state and went after it. And if you think
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.640]   about the other side, right, the people that are there, it must
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.840]   be very discomforting to hear because a lot of those people
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.520]   are folks that worked hard, tried to go to good schools, get
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.320]   educated, and join an infrastructure to move a country
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.160]   forward, because they believe in the country and the values
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.680]   sounds like a noble, noble mission, right? But over long
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.440]   periods of time, most people come and go. And then there's a
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.600]   small cohort of folks that sort of end up ossifying and running
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.840]   the top parts of this permanent bureaucracy. And I think Saks is
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.200]   right, they start to observe just the simple principle that
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.120]   all these folks come and go yet, I'm still around. President
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.600]   comes, President goes, undersecretary comes,
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.720]   undersecretary goes, the secretary of this comes in, then
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.320]   they go. And so they start to believe that they're really in
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.840]   charge. And that's where the deep state idea comes from.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.680]   At least we're in a democracy where these hearings are
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.800]   occurring. I just want to give kudos to in addition to those
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.080]   two journalists, to the people on this subcommittee, who are
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.440]   doing it in a bipartisan way. And they will be and they're
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.560]   being relentless. I think that's the honorable thing to do. I
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.960]   encourage them and those investigative journalists to be
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.600]   relentless.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.440]   And kudos to Rand Paul, too. Remember when he was
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.000]   profiling courage, people were like, this guy's a loon.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.680]   No, Rand Paul had a right.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.240]   To your point about what does this mean for our democracy, I
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.560]   want to just bring up the Semaphore article where they
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.280]   polled young people, and young voters, they despair over US
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.240]   politics, they describe the United States as a dying empire
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.720]   led by bad people. I mean, after what we've learned about COVID,
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.040]   and I would argue also the whole background to not wrong or is
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.400]   this right? Exactly. Their intuition is their intuition is
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.320]   right. Yeah, from the mouths of babes. I mean, it bad is I mean,
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.680]   if they covered this up, in the way it's looking like I would
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.400]   call this behavior, not bad. I'd call it evil, because it was
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.760]   premeditated. And then the point is, we're supposed to have this
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.480]   check and balance from the media. But when the media is
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.040]   complicit, because they like to be in those halls of power,
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.840]   that's where that's where these feelings come from. I think the
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.040]   latest stat that I saw is I think more than 52% of
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.240]   Americans now believe that the mainstream media is
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.120]   untrustworthy. And that's a really terrible place to be,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.840]   which means you're basically where do you get through, you're
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.920]   consuming something that's just fundamentally not true.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.480]   I mean, burn it down. I mean, that's the conclusion any
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.000]   logical person would come to is just burn it down. This makes no
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.160]   sense that they would try and cover this up. The right thing
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.360]   for Fauci to do is say, hey, listen, we didn't do gain of
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.000]   function. You know, under Obama, we did do it here. It's
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.880]   obviously been a mistake. We need to never do it again. And
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.520]   here's the roadmap to make sure that we protect people from the
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.840]   next one. Thank God this one didn't kill children the way
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.560]   it's killing all people. And by the way, this is gonna crack
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.760]   open. I encourage you all to be vocal about this and to watch
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.120]   on Monday, because Dr. Fauci is scheduled to appear in a
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.400]   hearing for the same sub committee and that is going to
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.440]   be explosive and live streamed on YouTube. We'll put the link
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   in the show notes. Since we're in the don't trust anybody and
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.160]   have your own sovereignty, and we're in libertarian moment.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.600]   Let's go to our crypto correspondent. It's crypto
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   corner with trauma.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.720]   It's part of my production company. I'm not doing crypto
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.280]   corner with your mouth. I'll be next week's call, though. I
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.720]   thought it would be good to talk about crypto. For a couple of
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.200]   reasons. One is because we just had the having at the end of
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.800]   April, when this happened. The having is where just for folks
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.360]   that don't know the way that bitcoins are created is by
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.600]   solving these complex mathematical algorithms that
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.120]   take a lot of time and energy and, and money. And when you
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.680]   solve it, you get rewarded with some number of Bitcoin. And
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.920]   roughly every four years, that reward gets cut in half. It's
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:58.480]   called a having. And this week, I saw somebody who reminded me
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.560]   all of this and I just want to give this guy a proper shout
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   out. So his name is Wences Casares and Wences in Silicon
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.000]   Valley, I would say really was agent zero of Bitcoin. He was
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.640]   the one in 2010 that introduced it to me. I remember he reminded
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.000]   me of the story. Actually, we were at orange hummus. And he's
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.080]   like, he's Argentinian. Great. He's a great so I'm going to
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.160]   try to copy his accent. You're not to buy the Bitcoin. So I
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.880]   heard the story. I fell in love with it. I remember I called my
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.800]   family office. I'm like, buy me a million of these things. And
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.920]   he was like, or a million dollars worth. And he was like,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.000]   Are you crazy? And I was like, No, there's just a little
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.080]   appetizer. We'll get to the main main course. Anyways, he has
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.880]   done a phenomenal job of understanding and proselytizing
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.960]   Bitcoin. And I want to thank him because he really put me on
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.240]   to this. But he mentioned something to me when I saw him a
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.280]   couple days ago, which is you should really look at the
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:54.000]   pattern of Bitcoin after a having. And so I was really
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.360]   curious. And so I had a guy on my team, Quentin put this
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.120]   together. So Nick, let me just let's go to the first page. So
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.360]   why is this interesting? So here's a little Bitcoin price
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.560]   analysis for you guys. So there's been a couple of having
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.880]   cycles that have happened. And I asked him to go back and look
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.200]   at the price performance one month after having three months,
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.160]   six months, nine months, 12 months, and 18 months after
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:24.240]   having. And what you notice is that there are these moments,
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.760]   initially, where essentially, when you go through a Bitcoin
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.120]   having, people are sort of reassessing what's happening.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.920]   And they're trying to figure it out. That's sort of what I would
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.480]   say is happens in the first month, and roughly what also
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.720]   happens in the first three months. But then within six
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.920]   months to a year and 18 months of these things, there are these
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.040]   crazy price appreciation cycles that happen. So that's what
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.680]   this page shows, which is, you know, 18 months after the first
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:59.680]   having the Bitcoin price returned 45 x, after the second
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.960]   having it returned almost 28 x. And after this third having it
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.640]   returned almost an eight x, which is really incredible
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.960]   returns in such a short period of time, if you go to the next
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.000]   page. And so if you if you graph that this is what it starts to
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.560]   show, which is what is this price performance after each of
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.840]   these having cycles? Now, why is that interesting? Well, it's
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.800]   interesting, because on top of this having which, theoretically,
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.680]   if history is a guide, we should see some price
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.160]   appreciation. Obviously, the other thing that's happened is
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.880]   we've commercialized Bitcoin. And we talked about this sort of
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.920]   as my big prediction for 2024, which is these ETFs are really
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.280]   going to allow Bitcoin to cross the chasm and habits, sort of
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.760]   central key moment, right. And so if you apply the averages,
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.160]   and again, these are just averages, they're by no means
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.720]   predictions, okay, so I just want to qualify that these are
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.360]   just not financial advice, not financial advice. These are just
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.840]   we took these and we applied it to the price of Bitcoin. And if
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   you go to the next page, you start to see what could happen
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.080]   if you just take the average of the last few cycles. So because
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.840]   the first cycle was so extreme, and you start to just doing
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.480]   cycle two and three here, to be clear, just the averages of
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.680]   cycle two and three. And what you start to see is some really
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.960]   meaningful appreciation. And when I talked to once is about
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.840]   this, how he explained it, which I which makes a lot of sense to
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:31.040]   me is there are a lot of countries that will never look
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.080]   at Bitcoin credibly, even if they support it, the US may be
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.640]   one of those, but there's an increasing body of countries
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:41.680]   that will become dual currency. And they will look at their
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.720]   local currency, and then they will look at Bitcoin. And they
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.760]   will say both of these two things are needed. One, when
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.400]   you're transacting on a daily basis for random goods and
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.160]   services. And two, when you need to buy a permanent asset that
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.000]   needs to have residual value, you'll use something like BTC.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.600]   And I think that's a very powerful concept. And if you
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:07.520]   look at what this price chart could indicate is that if this
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.720]   thing starts to get to these levels of appreciation, it is
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.000]   going to completely replace gold and start to become
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.840]   something that has transactional utility for hard
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.520]   assets. And I think if you marry that with this worry that
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.440]   some folks have about dollar debasement, you start to see
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   some really interesting opportunities. So I just thought
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.200]   that this was a interesting thing that he that he here's
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   our disclaimer, interesting thing that he put me on. I
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.800]   thought I'd share that with you. I'll publish this on
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.160]   Twitter. But that's your crypto corner for the year, folks.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.800]   I think it's really interesting how the crypto community is
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.920]   getting organized into basically a lobby to advocate for its
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.320]   interest, because it's the biggest lobby in America. Did
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.640]   you know that they've been so targeted over the last few
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:55.760]   years, because Gensler and Warren have been on a crusade to
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:59.040]   basically make crypto illegal or drive it offshore? Well,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.400]   every action has a equal and opposite reaction. And now the
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.440]   crypto people have basically had a political awakening and
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.280]   realize they have to get involved in the political
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.480]   system. Yeah, this is a matter of defense, self defense.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.680]   Shout out SPF. So they're getting a pioneer.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.680]   Well, not like that. I mean, like, I mean, he was dropping
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.040]   money on everybody. Yeah. Did you hear this? Did you hear this
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.000]   rumor that he was doing that to basically push for regulatory
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.480]   capture? Remember? Yeah, I think it's a point. Did you guys hear
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.760]   this? Did you guys hear this rumor that SPF was going to put
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.800]   a billion dollars into the election and convince Tom Brady
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   to run as a Republican? And give don't give the billion to
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.000]   Trump. Oh, sorry, give the billion to Trump. He was gonna
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.320]   give Trump a billion to not run. Okay. And then get Tom Brady
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.720]   run. I mean, this person had delusions of gravity. He thought
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.240]   he was a Jedi Knight. And he's like, literally in Jabba's
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.640]   palace right now. I don't know what this I mean, what a lunatic
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.840]   he was. I mean, talk about delusions of grandeur sacks.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.360]   This guy thought he would just drop a billion dollars and
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.000]   convince somebody not to run for government. I think we're
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.720]   gonna I think we're gonna get a regulatory, you know, back to
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.920]   the young people we talked about in the previous story. I think
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.880]   the reason they're attracted to crypto is because it doesn't
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.040]   have government control. And since if you don't trust the
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.760]   government, and you see the government over and over and
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.600]   over again, cover things up or the grift or make decisions that
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.560]   are not in your generation's best interest, why wouldn't you
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.040]   opt out of their financial system? And you know what,
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.520]   there's a lot of them. And they have they're getting organized
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.400]   to your point, sacks. I think we're going to have a crypto
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.960]   framework. And it's worth probably five points in this
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.280]   election. What do you think sacks? How many points is being
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.040]   the pro crypto candidate worth in this election? 123 points of
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.000]   votes, four points, it's got to be hard to show up, it'll be
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.440]   it'll be it could be 500 basis points. I mean, young people do
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.680]   not show up to vote because there isn't an issue that they
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.800]   care about. Correct. But there's 50 million Americans that own
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.920]   crypto 5050. Okay, so if 10% of them are like, let's say that's
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   their show. That's 5 million votes. No, no, no. There's a
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.520]   there's a plausible case where 40 million of those folks show
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.560]   up because you're talking about a structural part of their
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.760]   wealth creation. Right. So for example, like, you know, Biden,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.320]   President Biden talked about giving people a head start by
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.760]   eliminating their debt. That's a narrow issue. And the reason
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.000]   it's a narrow issue, there's just as many people that don't
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.080]   have debt, and just as many people that paid off their debt,
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.320]   and it creates a lot of haves and have nots. Right. And
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.960]   there's all these rules around who will get the debt relief,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.320]   etc. You end up touching four or 5 million people, maximum. But
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.280]   if there are 50 million people who have now decided to have at
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.400]   least the hedge against the establishment, and the
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.720]   traditional financial system, and you are threatening to take
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.240]   that wealth away, yeah, I could see how 80% of those folks show
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.800]   up to the ballot box and say, All right, which one of you will
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.440]   just leave me alone? And if the answer is President Trump, and
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.600]   they're all going to vote for President Trump, I think this is
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.000]   like such a great issue for political candidates to embrace.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.960]   And it's such a simple framework, I've said it a dozen
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.280]   times, create a sophisticated investor test, let 1000 flowers
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.760]   bloom, people can make whatever crypto projects they want. But
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.520]   to buy it, you just have to take a simple test like a driver's
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.120]   license, so that you don't risk your entire net worth or
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.160]   whatever. If you do, you're an informed buyer of crypto, just
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.280]   make a sophisticated investor test. And let's move on to mock
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.280]   just since we're in crypto corner before we leave crypto
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.000]   corner, when is my ape going to be worth money again, when will
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.560]   my ape go back on? Never. So my apes not coming back. Okay, so I
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.600]   guess I shouldn't have done that. All right. How's sax coin
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.920]   doing? We had sex point and we had went crazy, but that was a
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.880]   pump and dump scheme that we had nothing to do with I will never
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.640]   sell you a coin. Until I do. I just want to let everybody know
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.680]   that if you get a DM from me, I am not selling j coin until you
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.160]   hear it first. I would literally do an angel investing coin
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.040]   immediately if there was a framework for it would be the
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.760]   greatest idea ever to have like a j coin and I could just like
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   put it into startups that people could buy and sell it and be
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.600]   like this ongoing evergreen venture. Where's my J now?
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.040]   I love dows and I love I love the idea of an angel investing
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.880]   coin but man, startup coin would be brilliant. Yeah, the Jason
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.440]   coin is basically at zero it man it it was worth the sound is
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.800]   down to eight grand. Yeah. anything to do with sax coin
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.920]   either but I was more amused by it than anything else. Yeah,
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.600]   well, my friend decided to tell everybody he was gonna buy some
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.280]   and then straight to the moon.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.600]   It's hilarious. I have some. I've only we've only bought
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.720]   crypto twice. We have some doge which I bought during like our
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   doge phase a couple years ago. And then my wife presently bought
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.880]   Bitcoin, you know, at a very low price when everybody was
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.480]   talking around it around Thanksgiving. And my heart
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.680]   Bitcoin went phenomenal. And my doge is at break even now. So
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.040]   I've spent two years just on the pendulum. But who knows maybe
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.240]   those become a thing again. I love doge. All right, we have a
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.200]   bellwether of sorts here. Salesforce dropped more than 20%
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.480]   after reporting earnings. We should talk about the state of
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.680]   SaaS software as a service if you're not in the industry.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   Salesforce had its worst day in the markets in nearly 20 years
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.040]   on Thursday. And that's when we take this. It was about $40
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.560]   billion in market cap or as we say in the industry to figmas on
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.280]   Wednesday, Salesforce missed q1 revenue estimates for the first
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.640]   time since 2006. Revenue was up 9.1 billion 11% year over year,
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.760]   but about 40 million below Wall Street expectation. So they're
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.000]   doing great. But Wall Street is concerned for a reason we'll get
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.920]   into what that is net income was 1.5 billion seven X year over
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.400]   year because they've been doing a lot of cuts over their free
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.800]   cash flow 6 billion up 43%. Profits are up huge because if
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.600]   you remember those activist investors came in and had
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.280]   Benioff, really rethink the structure of the business and
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.720]   the footprint of the business, but guidance for q2 down.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.960]   Salesforce projecting 7% growth relatively low for them.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.240]   Freeberg, you and I were talking about this, like, what are your
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.120]   thoughts here on what's happening in the markets, and
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.400]   then we had the side discussion, which we didn't dock it, but I
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.640]   think it's worth bringing up here and dovetailing, which is,
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.720]   it does seem like the consumer, which is an enterprise story,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   but the economy is cooling off consumers, I think are running
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:44.080]   out of money, the Yolo economy is finally, I think, at its end.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.400]   What does this say to you, free bird?
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.840]   Well, I think the key question to your point, is there a macro
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.040]   economic reason for a slowdown in their business, they're
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.160]   forecasting for this next fiscal year, revenue growth of only
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.240]   eight to 9%. And for this next quarter, it's basically a flat
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.000]   revenue quarter relative to the past quarter. So for this
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.400]   fiscal year, 38 billion of top line revenue, 9 billion of
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.080]   operating cash flow. And with the market cap coming down by
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.440]   20%, the stocks at a $200 billion valuation. So it's
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.200]   trading it, you know, call it roughly 20 times their operating
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   cash flow forecast with sub 10% revenue growth. And that's
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.440]   basically where treasuries trade, right? Because treasury
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.520]   yields for 30 year treasury, you can get 4.7% today.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.960]   Yeah, it's about say, almost five,
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.600]   you know, that's about 20 x, right. So that's about where the
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.720]   multiple is on this Salesforce stock. So I think it really begs
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.440]   the question on, you know, is there a macro economic force
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.240]   where the enterprise is spending less? Because of, you know, a
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.840]   revenue slowdown in the economy, which we saw in the latest GDP
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.000]   report, that's number one, that could be driving this and will
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.880]   affect ultimately the multiple for all these enterprise SaaS
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.400]   companies. Or number two, is there a shifting underway in the
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.760]   SaaS business model, that the premium that SaaS companies were
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.400]   able to charge in the pricing model on a per seat basis, and
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.680]   the dollars that they're able to charge per employee or per user
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.200]   is so significant, relative to what that enterprise can build
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.880]   themselves now, with the commoditization available to
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.400]   them under this new era of AI, and the ability to build tools
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.920]   internally, or the ability for competitors to emerge with
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.640]   significantly underpriced alternatives, because they can
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.720]   use generative AI to make software that can compete. And
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.800]   then there's this other question, because Salesforce has
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.640]   been leaning in heavily on the generative AI capabilities that
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.920]   they're offering their customers. And it seems like the
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.520]   question is, are enterprises waiting to see the value of that
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.480]   generative AI service capability? Is it worth paying
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.120]   for today? Should I wait and see? Or is it actually
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.840]   indicating that there's a big commoditization and generative AI
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.240]   underway? Okay, meaning why do we have to pay Salesforce a
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.800]   bunch of money when I can use some open source third party
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.640]   tool or some more freely available tool?
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.080]   So Chamath, Freyberg presented two options here, one of them,
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.320]   macroeconomic slowdown, the other one, hey, software, you
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.240]   know, belt tightening is happening inside the enterprise
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.080]   and it's cheaper to make. So maybe we have a deflationary
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.360]   kind of situation inside companies, I guess this is
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.960]   adjacent, that last part of his theory is adjacent to the 8090
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.800]   mission you're on with your new startup. And maybe this is this
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.280]   is an or or an end in your mind, Chamath, is it both these
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.680]   things? But sorry, before you answer, the third point I made
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.120]   was that generative AI might Yes. And the third point may not
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.920]   be a product line, it may not be enough to charge for given all
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.080]   the open source tools. Yes. And there's a big question mark
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.200]   about the AI new software, will people pay for it? So Chamath
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.120]   take those three, what are your thoughts?
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.600]   I think that if you look at what happened before, we had
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:52.080]   a cycle where very large monolithic software was
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.520]   replaced by the SAS vendors, and Salesforce led that charge.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.800]   And they led the many ways the definition of the cloud. So
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.440]   that was amazing. That was this one big cycle. And before that,
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.560]   that monolithic, those monolithic software vendors were
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.120]   replacing like mainframes and very archaic stuff. This is sort
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.480]   of this third disruptive cycle, we're going to go through a
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:20.400]   process of ripping and replacing these legacy products. And so
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.920]   Jenny, I is just a, an enablement layer that allows you
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.160]   to deliver functionality to people. And I think what you're
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.240]   going to find is that it allows you to deliver that
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.480]   functionality at much, much cheaper. To your point, that's
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.280]   the whole point of 8090. We, you know, we always joke with
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.480]   Salesforce going to get 8090. Yeah, because you can deliver
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.280]   80% of the features at a 90% discount pretty easily today.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.480]   And what you can't deliver today will get much, much easier
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.320]   in a year and two years and three years, for sure in 10
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.760]   years. So I think what the market is voting with their
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.360]   dollars, is that these large, lumpy monolithic software
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:06.240]   companies that need big 50 $100 million customers, they're not
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.200]   going to find them soon, because those customers will realize
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.840]   that you could get, you know, what Friedberg said, what you
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.960]   need for 10 million, or 5 million, or 1 million, or 500,000.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.040]   And in some cases free. And so the cost structure of your
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.160]   organization makes no sense. And so you're going to have to
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.440]   go through this very complicated cycle of recycling, you know,
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.320]   the business model, which unfortunately will mean tons of
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.840]   layoffs. And that's not a today thing. But over these next five
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.040]   and 10 years, that's probably what's going to happen. And it
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.080]   doesn't mean Salesforce is a bad company. It's just that it is
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.640]   on the wrong side of the life cycle. And the odds are
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.960]   overwhelmingly such that a bunch of small companies will flood
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.720]   this opportunity and provides cheaper, smaller, more flexible
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.360]   capabilities.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.720]   Saks, obviously, you made your bones in the SaaS business over
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.400]   the last two decades, at least. What are your thoughts here on
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.640]   the challenges? I just interviewed Owen McCabe from
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.280]   intercom, and he says he thinks the seat model is going to
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.000]   change. And obviously, if there's less people at companies,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.600]   there's less seats. And that may be a headwind that you just
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.240]   can't win against. So maybe a consumption model has to happen
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.640]   or a different pricing model. But what are your thoughts on
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.000]   what's happening at Salesforce, and then open the aperture there
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.720]   and tell us what you think is going to happen in terms of how
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.560]   corporations either decide to make that, you know, build or
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.000]   buy decision?
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.760]   Well, I think it's pretty amazing that Salesforce lost
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.000]   something like 40 billion of market cap because of a revenue
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.920]   mess of 40 million. You know, it's amazing how these relatively
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.880]   small in percentage terms, misses in revenue earnings drive
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   such huge changes in market cap.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.320]   Quite a ripple, isn't it?
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.200]   Yeah. I mean, look, my view is that I don't have a strong view
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.040]   about the stock, but my sense is probably a buying opportunity.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.280]   I mean, I think Salesforce is still a great company. Mark
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.080]   Benioff is a great CEO. He's always positioned the company to
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.840]   chase after whatever the current thing is. So obviously, he was
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.560]   one of the first to realize that software was headed to the
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.840]   cloud, evangelize for the cloud. Then when the social networking
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.320]   revolution happened, he launched Chatter, which was a
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.440]   competitor to my product Yammer back then. But he was ahead of
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.040]   the curve on social and the enterprise. Then it was big data
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.800]   and they launched Einstein. Now they've got AI and they're going
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.320]   to be doing a bunch of different things there. So my guess is
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.160]   he's going to figure out how to take advantage of this AI trend
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.480]   for the company. They're not going to miss it. They're not
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.800]   going to get caught totally flat footed. So you look, I don't
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   have a super strong point of view on it as an investment, but
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.600]   I still think it's a good company.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.480]   What about the bigger picture? Open the aperture there with
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.000]   the Salesforce and pricing and how many people work at these
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.720]   companies. And then if the per seat model is the model, and
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.520]   then people are going to have less humans working at companies
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.800]   and do more with less, how does that mean for SAS writ large?
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.600]   I'm honestly not worried about the per seat model. I mean, the
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:16.480]   point of a pricing plan should be to align revenue expansion
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.080]   with ROI, meaning the more value that a customer gets from
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.200]   your product, the more they're willing to pay. And you just
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.520]   need some proxy for measuring that seats are a good proxy.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.320]   It's a good way to measure how much value the customer is
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.080]   getting out of your product, because the more seats they're
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.040]   buying, the more value they must be getting. Yes, you could do
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.880]   it some other way. You could basically meter data usage. You
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.600]   could meter API usage. Sure. Those models will work for other
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.320]   kinds of companies, but I don't think there's going to be a huge
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.560]   disruption to the seat model is my sense.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.080]   Look, I think the bigger issue here is that their forecast was
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.560]   soft, right? They are forecasting what sub 10% revenue
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.520]   growth, they're going to and this is why the stock got
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.760]   punished. And I'm seeing that a bunch of SAS companies are kind
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.480]   of hurting today. Now in the wake of this, they're down like
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:14.720]   5%, not 20. But so I wonder if what the market is wondering is
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.920]   whether there's a more general slowdown that we're on the
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.240]   precipice of I don't think that that explains 40 to 20% drop in
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.000]   a day. I think typically these public market investors
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.440]   internalize a bunch of fears, and they don't execute on those
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.480]   fears. And then when given an opportunity, they just barf it
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.160]   all out, because it's like now it's acceptable. And so to your
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.320]   point, David, like it was such like a, an insignificant revenue
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.280]   miss, so as to not even be important, quite honestly. But
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.400]   the reason it's down 20% is I think folks have internalized
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.160]   different set of risks. And then they've found an escape hatch
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.400]   where they have plausible deniability for selling. That's
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.880]   just what a lot of public market investors do. I don't think
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.560]   it's a coincidence that we just had the GDP forecast revised
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.920]   down for the latest quarter. What was it? It's down to like
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.520]   1.4% something. Yeah, we talked about this last week, because
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.800]   it's this number is fake. The economy is looking pretty soft
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.600]   right now. Which is, I guess a good jumping off point, which
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.280]   is do what do we think is happening here with the economy
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.080]   and then interest rates, because the whole goal here was to get
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.280]   us under, you know, get us close to 2%, get rid of the free
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.120]   handle, at least in terms of interest going up and maybe get
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.360]   the consumers to not be spending so much money, which is crazy to
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.440]   think about or maybe get more people laid off and have the
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.920]   unemployment not so low. Remember when everyone was
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.640]   talking about soft landing? Yeah, the reason why they were
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.440]   having that conversation is because the Fed jacked up
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.800]   interest rates really suddenly from roughly zero to five, five
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.920]   and a half percent. And it works that has an impact on
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.840]   people's consumption, because debt is much more expensive. So
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.320]   again, it's it's where to buy a house harder to buy a car,
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.080]   anything you need to finance gets much harder. It took a long
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.080]   time for this to work its way through the economy. But I think
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.400]   we're finally seeing it now. I think we're I think that's
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   exactly right. I think we're here when you see that three
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.960]   handle, like, does it go down? You know, it's very interesting
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.600]   about the 2% target, I went down the rabbit hole to try to
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.040]   figure out that 2% target. Like, I was like, who came up
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.320]   with 2% as a number, like, why isn't it three or 2.5? Or 1.5?
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.280]   Or one? It's a guy in New Zealand who was, you know, came
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.440]   up with what he thought was a good target 2%, the world
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.280]   adopted it. So going back to our conversation about experts.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.920]   Yeah, he just really admits it. He's just like, yeah, I just
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.120]   thought 3% seemed like the right number wasn't too high, wasn't
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.840]   too low. And it's kind of healthy to have things go up in
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.360]   price, because that means the economy is growing. It's just a
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.720]   random target 2% was his gut. Incredible, right?
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.080]   Incredible. Yeah, I mean, if you look at this, we are at what
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:55.920]   is it 3.6% annualized CPI inflation and 1.3% annualized
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.440]   GDP growth and a 4.7% 30 year treasury yield. This is I don't
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.120]   know what else is more definitional of stagflation. The
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.920]   economy is not growing prices are going up and the cost of
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.840]   borrow has gone through the roof.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.840]   Someone's got to give and then also if they keep raising taxes,
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.520]   well, it's like their plans are then affluent people are going
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.600]   to be trying to protect their assets and who's they I'm just
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.800]   thinking like a politician like if a politician were to raise
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.960]   taxes dramatically, but I don't want to I don't want you to
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.760]   have Biden derangement syndrome here sacks. Okay, well, I can
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.480]   promise you this. I don't think Trump's gonna raise taxes, but
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.160]   I know he has the trifecta. Absolutely, absolutely. That's
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.960]   why I'll see you Thursday night with my $50,000 check. I can't
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.240]   wait to be there. Yeah, it's gonna easily be paid for by my
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.560]   tax cut. Just to jump back for a second on the point. So you
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.200]   know, Salesforce faces these challenges, but it's still led
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.960]   by Mark Benioff. Absolutely. That dude's tremendous. And if
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.880]   you look at the performance of the average public company,
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.800]   regardless of the sector that that business operates in, that
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.880]   is run by a hired CEO versus run by a founder CEO. Yeah, the
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.320]   founder public companies that have that have gone public
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.120]   achieved a $10 billion market cap and are still founder run as
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.360]   the CEO from their outperform nearly any index you look at.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.600]   And this is I think like a really key point you could
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.520]   probably put together I think some people have done this put
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.360]   together a founder portfolio, but I wouldn't count out Benioff
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.080]   just because of some of the stuff that we've talked about
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.600]   as founders, founders, founders can and will maneuver their way
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.800]   to success. That is the hunger of let's do our let's do our
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.440]   draft. The one founders you should not bet against which
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.040]   founder would you least want to short Chamath your first in the
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.600]   draft? What do you got? Who would you not want to bet
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.640]   against? Worst person to bet against? Sorry, what do you
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.480]   mean? Like founders? Any entrepreneur in history know
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.640]   what happened when people tried to short you on they got
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.360]   incinerated barbecue sauce. Okay, you got you picked you on
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.040]   the draft then it's number one. You got? Yeah, that's easy. I
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.360]   would pick you too. Okay, but we can't pick somebody out.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.440]   That's why it's a draft here. We took you and I gotta take the
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.840]   next person. It could be anybody doesn't have to be alive
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.720]   doesn't have to be in position right now. Who would I say?
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.800]   Sorry? What's what founder least likely to short? An
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.160]   entrepreneur you least want to short? Well, there you are.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.120]   Listen, there's yours. Hold on. Now free break. You get to go
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.760]   in the draft. Yeah, I don't know the I mean, all these
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.520]   founders. I don't know how to pick one. I mean, what are you
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:41.040]   going to go with? Yeah, I'm going to go with go with Bill
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:46.080]   Gates. What he's not always talking. No, I said it could be
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.400]   any time period of time. Yeah, now that you know the stock
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.880]   performance. What are you talking about? I just think even
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:20:00.320]   in the next. You're gonna go out on a limb and say that was
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.040]   Bill Gates was doing his legendary run. I wouldn't have
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.400]   shorted it. I also wouldn't short Michael Jordan or LeBron
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.840]   James, Steph Curry, definitely wouldn't get bet against him.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.800]   All right, everybody breaking news today in the law being
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.160]   fair. I'm sorry today in lawfare depending on your view
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.720]   Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony charges. You can choose
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.680]   your own framing here. Some say it's election interference.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.560]   Some people are referring to this as the hush money porn
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.720]   star case. Other people are calling it the deep state
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.640]   lawfare case. The jury deliberated for about a day and
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.960]   a half. Trial lasted six weeks, include testimony from 20
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.240]   witnesses. Key moment seems to have been Trump's CFO
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.960]   Weisselberg, who's I think in jail right now for other
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.720]   charges, outlining the terms of the payments to Michael Cohen,
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.400]   the disgraced lying attorney who recorded Trump's
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:59.040]   conversations. And that's I think all I can tell you about
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.960]   this, except for maybe the sentencing is coming up. It's
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.520]   going to be July 11, which is but four days before the RNC.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.760]   Clearly a sad day for America. I'm not sure if anybody on the
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.520]   panel has any opinions on the Trump verdict, but let's just
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.360]   randomly start with you, David. Any thoughts on Trump being
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.640]   convicted of 34 felonies in this case?
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.680]   Well, first of all, in terms of understanding this case, I
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.240]   think it's important to understand that both Merrick
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.240]   Garland's DOJ and former Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, they
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.640]   looked at this case, they looked at these charges, and they
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.960]   passed on bringing this case. Alvin Bragg, who's a Soros
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:43.280]   funded DA, he won a hotly contested race to succeed Vance
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.880]   by pledging to get Trump. And that's why he brought this case.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.720]   And in order to bring these charges, he had to use a
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.640]   creative legal formula that turned a misdemeanor charge of
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.200]   falsifying business records, a charge that would have been
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.720]   passed the statute of limitations into a felony by
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.080]   claiming it was in the service of a second crime. But he never
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.080]   named exactly what that crime was, or proved that it happened.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.400]   And I think it's safe to say that a case like this, which is
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.880]   novel and creative and torturous, would never have been
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.800]   brought against anybody but Trump. Now, there's about five
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.920]   different grounds for appeal on this. Number one, the judge is a
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.280]   Biden donor with a daughter who works for Biden. Number two,
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.320]   prejudicial and irrelevant evidence was admitted that
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.640]   should have been excluded, including Stormy Daniels
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.080]   testimony. Number three, Trump was not able to call his expert
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.240]   in election law, former head of FEC, Bradley Smith. Number
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.480]   four, the prosecution never named the second crime. And then
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.360]   number five, the judge let the jury pick from a range of
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.200]   options for what the second crime might be, including tax
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.000]   crimes, which no evidence was presented, and federal election
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.680]   crimes, which the court had no jurisdiction. So, my guess is
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.080]   that at the end of the day, this case is going to get tossed on
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.480]   appeal, but that's probably going to happen after the
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.000]   election, after November 5th, and Democrats now have what they
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.440]   wanted. They wanted to get out of this case four words,
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.560]   Donald Trump convicted felon, and you're going to be hearing
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.160]   that phrase, convicted felon repeated ad nauseum from now
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.120]   until November 5. And I think that's the whole point of this
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:17.680]   case.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.640]   Freeberg, your take.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.560]   No, I mean, it felt like this was always a win win trial for
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:28.880]   Trump if he gets convicted, then, you know, the conversation
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.960]   that we're hearing now, you know, this was an unfair
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.840]   conviction. How could they do this? This is lawfare. And if he
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.000]   doesn't get convicted, they tried to burn him at the stake.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.240]   How could they try and do that? Clearly, he's innocent. He was
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.240]   made innocent. So, you know, it never really struck me as being
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.120]   a smart, I'm not a political guy, but the political calculus
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.240]   just seemed off on this entirely. It certainly wasn't
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.440]   clear what they were trying to accomplish. Either way, Trump
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.680]   looks good. And I think we saw tonight reports that his
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:03.840]   website for making donations crashed. A lot of people started
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.360]   making public statements on Twitter that are not typically
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.320]   Republican donors, that they're donating a lot of money to
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.440]   Donald Trump coming out of this. And so it is clearly infuriating
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.280]   a lot of people that as Saks points out, you know, something
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.920]   that some people are considering to be, you know, a bookkeeping
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.760]   or accounting crime has turned into 34 felony convictions. It
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.520]   feels unfair, it feels like the wrong decision. And it's going
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.840]   to infuriate people because people worry about the quality
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.640]   of the justice system. Anyone who's sitting in the middle, as
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.000]   an independent or an undecided, I think it is much more likely
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   that they're going to have sympathy for Donald Trump coming
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.520]   out of this not admonishment.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.720]   Shamaf, your take.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.840]   I think that if you went into this, looking to confirm your
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:51.360]   hatred of President Trump, you you were the one that was given
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.880]   red meat. And I think that if you were undecided, or pro
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.720]   President Trump, you probably found more reason to support him
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.320]   for all the reasons that Friedberg said. The thing that's
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.120]   unique about this specific trial, that I found rather
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.480]   interesting, was the diversity of people who just couldn't
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.880]   understand what this trial was about, whether it was Bill Barr,
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.120]   who worked for him, but was not a huge fan of his nor was, you
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.720]   know, Trump, or vice versa, right, to an Alan Dershowitz to
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.680]   Cyrus Vance, you had Democrats and Republicans and
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:37.200]   independents, legal scholars, legal experts, some who like
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.520]   President Trump, some who did not, some who got along with
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.680]   him, some who did not, some who fought with him, some who did
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.080]   not, some who got fired by him, some who did not. And they were
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.800]   all categorically confused about what this whole thing was
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.920]   about. I'm not legally well versed enough to understand what
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.640]   it was. So as a layman, you then tend to go to this next
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.400]   obvious thing, which is you have to bucket this decision as
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.760]   here are some experts, and what they know is better than what I
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.720]   know. And we talked about this earlier on the pod today, when
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.320]   it came to Fauci, and it turned out to not be so true. Or you go
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.760]   to this other place where are there systems of government
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.840]   that can be convoluted and turned in the favor of the
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.160]   majority who's in power against someone that they feel is a
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.480]   threat. And we've talked about that as well, with respect to
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.600]   how some of these governmental institutions have targeted some
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.640]   of our friends. So I think that we're in a very precarious
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.080]   moment where the systems of governments in the United States
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.560]   are a little bit more fragile than they were the moment.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   Okay, if people are wondering what the case is actually about
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.600]   falsifying business records, this is a pretty serious crime,
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.080]   in New York City. Basically, when people don't keep correct
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.400]   records, when they're committing crimes, this is taken seriously
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.960]   in New York, because it is the financial capital of the world.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.040]   They've got a long history, whether it's, you know, Bernie
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.000]   Madoff, Enron, etc, of pursuing these, I don't know why this
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.400]   didn't get communicated well to the public. But there were
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.920]   obviously tons of business records falsified here. And they
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.080]   basically admitted to it, Michael Cohen had pleaded
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.920]   guilty to it already. And so it really feels like a
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.080]   misdemeanor. And then to understand what happened after
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.320]   that, there is a law in New York, as Saks correctly pointed
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.880]   out on top of the falsifying of business records, which New York
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.240]   takes deadly seriously. And they put this in every indictment
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.840]   when people do it because they want the accountants, lawyers,
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:49.200]   CFOs to behave themselves and not cheat the public. The
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.600]   election interference also taken very seriously in New York,
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.200]   there's been tons of cases, again, typically minor things,
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.160]   but people who do things like try to stuff ballots, etc. And
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.800]   so you put those two together. If you do falsifying, if you
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.360]   falsify business records, and you do it as part of a second
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.800]   crime, which he did, which he was convicted of, then you get
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.160]   these penalties. So that is the explanation of the case. That
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.520]   was why he was found guilty. It's pretty easy to figure this
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.760]   all out. If you don't know all this, it's because you didn't
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.160]   take the time to read anything about the case. In terms of the
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.680]   basic heuristics of it, which I think is because people are
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.440]   burned out on this. Trump has committed so many misdemeanors
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.480]   and crimes over time that we're kind of used to it. And you
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.360]   know, my personal take on it, and I'll just leave it at this
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.400]   is I think it's going to be a speeding ticket. I do think it's
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.200]   going to get overturned. I think Trump has done this his
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.720]   whole career. I lived in New York, all these real estate
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.760]   guys were doing all these kind of like little ticky tacky
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.560]   cheating things. And I do think that this was politically
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.280]   motivated. What was the second crime, Jacob, you if you
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.720]   understand election interference, election, what is
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.280]   that you're not allowed to interfere with election. So the
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.680]   theory here, which the you know, the jury unanimously voted in
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.720]   front of in over the six or seven weeks, election
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:21.840]   interference was because Trump was in dire straits. He after
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.160]   the access Hollywood tape came out that weekend, when he
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.080]   admitted to assaulting women, the grab them by the blank came
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.880]   out. His team, in this case, admitted including his
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.320]   assistant, Michael Cohen, Alan Weisselberg, and of course, the
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.560]   guy from the National Enquirer, Pecker, all of them agreed,
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.720]   testified, and just were completely honest that this
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.480]   payment and the reason they bought these people off was
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:55.200]   because they were scared that it would reduce his chances of
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.400]   being elected. They were in panic mode. They all testify to
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:02.960]   that. The jury found that they committed these crimes, the
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.920]   falsifying of business records in order to save his election
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.160]   chances. So that is the legal concept. This legal concept was
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.200]   available to everybody for the last you know, since it's been
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:17.600]   filed in the New York Times, anybody who doesn't read these
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.200]   basic things and comments on this case is just a partisan who
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.320]   doesn't want to accept the reality that these are actual
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.520]   legal concepts that are completely valid. Now, I do
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.600]   think despite all of that, and me making it abundantly clear to
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.840]   anybody that you don't want people falsifying business
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.120]   records, and you also don't want anybody interfering in
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.600]   elections, I do think it was politically motivated. So you
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.480]   got to keep two things in your mind at the same time. It's
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:46.720]   politically motivated. Trump commits crimes regularly often,
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.520]   but they don't want to reverse you just said it was going to
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.080]   be reversed on appeal. So if you're so confident it's a
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.000]   crime, then why do you also say it's going to get reversed?
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.440]   Yeah, because I think well, I'll let me restate that. I
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.520]   think he's going to get a speeding ticket. I don't think
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.440]   the case is going to reverse. I think there's going to be some
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.320]   sort of a pardon now that this is a state kind of situation.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   So it wouldn't be Biden who would pardon it, it would be
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.840]   the the governor. And I think what's going to happen is
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.800]   somebody like Trump, Teflon Don, he's called that for a
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.440]   reason. He gets away with it every time he's rich, he's
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.080]   powerful, like all rich and powerful people, you have to
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.480]   really do something heinous to wind up in jail. So I think
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.520]   it's going to be a speeding ticket. I do think the the
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.360]   documents cases, that one is a pretty legitimate one with
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.160]   obstruction. And I do think the election interference, those
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.320]   are the two he should be really worried about, because if he is
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.920]   found guilty on those, those are legit. But I do think this
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.840]   country is going to need to come together. I hate to be the
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.960]   bigger person here. But I do think the company, the country
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:44.560]   needs to get together and get us to new candidates. And we
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.640]   can't be having this lawfare and politically motivated
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.440]   lawsuits every time somebody loses or they're afraid of
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.120]   losing an election. But let me ask you a question, Jason,
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.480]   you're a you're a you're a famous, successful person. And
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.720]   over the next 10 or 20 years, the odds are pretty good,
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.800]   you'll be more famous, more successful, say more Chema,
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.680]   do you feel? Do you feel the less the same or more? Okay,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.480]   you have to say less same or more. Okay, somebody in
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.400]   government doesn't like what you're up to. After today, are
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.880]   you less the same or more in terms of the risk that the laws
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.720]   could be used to fight you?
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.800]   I think we're kind of in the same area. I think there's
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.080]   always been politically motivated prosecutions that
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.120]   have occurred. That's part of, you know, the flaw in our legal
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.360]   system. And I do think appeals, pardons exist as the the
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.920]   relief valve for those things. And I think for rich and
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.320]   powerful people with great representation, they always get
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.880]   off unless they've done something incredibly,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.600]   incredibly heinous. And I don't think this is incredibly
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.000]   heinous. And so when it's framed as simply, oh, it's a
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.600]   porn star, he banged the porn star, who cares? It was
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.560]   consensual, and she got to pay off or maybe she was extorting
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.520]   him, even, you know, I don't know if those details were ever
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.600]   determined, if you could frame it as extortion or not. I think
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.640]   none of that matters. Like this, this falsifying business
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:15.600]   records thing is just something they did, they should just own
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.560]   it, they should have just pled it out. And it should have
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.920]   probably never been escalated to the next level with the
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.600]   election interference. I thought that was a little bit of
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.040]   a stretch, but not that much escalated because Alvin Bragg
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.040]   got elected to pursue this case.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.120]   And that's the only way you could get it from a misdemeanor
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:31.760]   to a felon.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.440]   Yeah, exactly. So I think that is part of the
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.960]   I know you're really giddy about this, Jake, how I can hear
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.760]   your voice.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.560]   No, I'm not. Honestly, I wish you're doing. No, sorry, sex,
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.640]   you don't get to say I'm giddy. I'm not going to tell you how
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.960]   you feel. You don't get to tell me how I feel. I actually am
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.200]   sad for America. I'm sad for America. That Trump and Biden
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.080]   are our choices.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:54.640]   Okay, great.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640]   So speak for yourself, not for me.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.360]   Okay, great. Well, maybe I'm just detecting enthusiasm in
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.160]   your voice. I'm not quite sure.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.760]   No enthusiasm, not at all.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.480]   You're presenting these documents on the screen that are
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.120]   basically from Alvin Bragg's case, it's all you're doing is
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.280]   repeating his theory of the case, which I must say is
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.800]   extremely tortured. And it's novel. I don't think a case like
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.360]   this ever been brought. And if you are going to bring a case
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.640]   against a former president, it should be for something more
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.240]   than ticky tacky type stuff, stuff that you yourself admit is
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.080]   politically motivated. It's obvious. Bragg was out to get
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.240]   Trump. This is a campaign strategy. You have to bend the
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:36.560]   law into a pretzel to create the case that you're describing.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.360]   Listen, you know, I think Trump will continue to do these.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.160]   He's had these long before he was in public office. He got
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.640]   tons of speeding tickets like this, he'll get them after he's
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.720]   out of office. He's always committed crimes. He's always
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.240]   done what this reminds me of is, you remember Ken Starr and
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.080]   what they went after Bill Clinton for with the whole
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.040]   Monica Lewinsky thing? Sure. And when that star report
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.120]   dropped, you know, and then hundreds of pages of
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.440]   legalities, and they described all the prurient behavior and,
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.320]   you know, amazing amounts of detail. At the end of the day,
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.400]   the American people looked at it and decided that maybe
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.800]   there's a tawdry element to this, but it's personal
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.440]   behavior. And after some period of time, Clinton's popularity
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.840]   rebounded, and he actually gained seats in the midterms
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.920]   because the Republicans overplayed their hand. Yeah,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.120]   totally. And I think in a similar way, it's very clear to
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.280]   me. And in fact, you've already said this is politically
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.720]   motivated. And they basically have taken some sort of
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:32.720]   bookkeeping error that was a misdemeanor that was passed the
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.360]   statute of limitations. And they've combined it again with
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.320]   this very novel legal theory about somehow committing
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.880]   fraud in the election, which, by the way, was not actually
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.800]   proven in the case. And as part of the jury instructions,
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:50.640]   again, the judge allowed the jury to have a multiple choice
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.440]   on what the second crime was, which is what a lot of legal
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.960]   experts think will become the basis for appeal. So again,
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.040]   this whole case was tortured, it was politically motivated. I
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.320]   would go so far as to say it's a sham. It's an outrage. And I
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.880]   think people are reacting as though it's an outrage. And
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.360]   again, if you're going to bring a case, not just against a
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.640]   former president, but the current front runner to be the
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.440]   next president, it better be something important. Not this
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.720]   ticky tacky thing that the way you describe it as being
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.000]   ticky tacky. Why even waste the public's time with this? Why
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.880]   even spend all the money pursuing this? I think I told
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.240]   you why be? Yeah, no, Donald Trump convicted felon. That's
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.600]   the reason why the media wants that talking point. And by the
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.440]   way, if you want to make a switcheroo and get a different
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.920]   candidate than Joe Biden, that's not going to happen now
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.920]   because Democrats in the media think that this is their
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.640]   salvation. They know the running candidate. It's not
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.400]   going to be. The obstruction case and the January 6th case,
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.800]   that is, those are legit cases. They should have just gone
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.720]   after those because those are the ones that are completely
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.920]   legit. But here we are. The Democrat party knows the
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.320]   running candidate who can't debate, who can't put two
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.920]   sentences together, who can barely find his way off a stage,
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.560]   whose policies are coming home to roost. The economy, like we
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.080]   talked about on the show, is slowing down very rapidly. His
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.680]   foreign policy is a disaster. But they think that somehow this
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:16.080]   is going to be his salvation is being able to say that Donald
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.320]   Trump is a felon. That's their plan. And I think at the end of
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.720]   the day, this is probably not going to work. All right, there
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.440]   you have it, folks. There's your quick hot take around the
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.320]   horn with your bestie on Trump being convicted by a jury in
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.720]   New York today. He'll be sentenced on July 11th, and
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.320]   we'll see what happens there. The market also, after we talked
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.080]   about Salesforce, a bunch of the SAS companies took a dive in
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.640]   the after hours. Freeberg, any thoughts there? Because we
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.880]   quickly are not just SAS, but also Dell. And in particular,
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.960]   Dell reported their stock is down 20% after hours. So I do
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.000]   wonder if there is a slow reckoning underway right now in
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.240]   technology. That's as we talked about in the show, a function of
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.880]   both kind of an economic slowdown. So enterprises making
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.320]   fewer investments, but they were they clearly called out the
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.320]   increased cost associated with AI. So they are spending quite
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.040]   a lot and their, their cogs on AI systems is much higher. And
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.160]   so they're showing I mean, cash burn. And I think this is a
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.640]   point you must been talking for a while. It's unsustainable,
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.960]   guys. I've been saying this now for a month. So let's just be
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.960]   precise again. You cannot spend this kind of money and show no
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.960]   incremental revenue potential. So while this is incredible for
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.120]   Nvidia, the chicken is coming home to roost. Because if you do
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.760]   not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of these
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.480]   companies that are spending $26 billion a quarter, the market
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.360]   cap of Nvidia is not what the market cap of Nvidia should be.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.680]   And all of these other companies are going to get
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.720]   punished for spending this kind of money. Now, Dell is a unique
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.480]   example in the sense that I actually think it's a
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:56.080]   beneficiary of spend. And I think that it will build data
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.560]   centers. And it will actually do well in the move to AI because
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.760]   it's a very smartly positioned pick and shovels provider. But
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.960]   the threshold question is, where are all these newfangled
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.160]   things that we're supposed to see that justifies $100 billion
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:17.200]   of chip spending your $200 billion of energy spend $100
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.320]   billion of all this other stuff, guys, this is, we're now
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.760]   spending $750 billion. This is on the order of a national
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:30.400]   transfer payment. And we've seen nothing to show for it except
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.640]   that you can mimic somebody's voice. And you can make like a
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:34.880]   cat.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.440]   I mean, making a developer 30 or 40% more efficient, that's
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.200]   actually legit. But I will say I didn't get either. No, that's
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.000]   total. No, no, that's happening in startups right now. I'm
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.800]   seeing startups with four developers do what just a couple
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.960]   of years ago, they would need a to do there. And that's the
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:54.480]   premise of your company. I think that developers can go faster
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.200]   with these tools that these are, yes, but these are aspirational
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.320]   things. When you take a, for example, a 30,000 person
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.920]   company, it is not true that those engineers now are now all
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.440]   of a sudden, as productive as 130,000 employees, it's not even
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.200]   true that 1000 employee company is as productive as a 4000
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.200]   person company. And the reason is for one very specific thing.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.160]   Even as all of these next generation, next generation
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.280]   models get released, the practical threshold problem is
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.800]   when you introduce a completely new way of doing things into an
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:30.000]   existing workforce, what happens is people push back. And even in
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.320]   the companies that I own, where I could theoretically mandate,
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.960]   you must use these tools, because I am the owner of this
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.840]   company. It doesn't happen. And so I think what you're really
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.280]   seeing, Jason is a few people embrace it. Those people may be
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.880]   50 to 100% more productive. But when you blend that into the
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.840]   entire workforce, it's still a single digit percentage, which
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.040]   means the productivity gains are nominal. Yeah, I think it's a
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.760]   fair point. Because I'm forced to spend Yeah, again, $750
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.120]   billion a year, it doesn't all hang together yet.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.880]   Yeah, I agree. There's going to be a bit of a gap there. And I
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:07.200]   am biased, because I see startups, which are always
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.360]   looking for the most resourceful way to do things. And you're
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.320]   talking about large enterprises, which are slow to adopt, right?
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.720]   So I think we're both to be right here. Yeah.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.520]   You get around the innovators dilemma by saying, guys, you
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.120]   need to be AI first, from the outset, which a startup can do
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.240]   because they can, they can recruit people that, for example,
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.840]   with 8090, same thing, you must use these tools. For example, we
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.880]   are not allowed to have any administrative staff. Everything
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.160]   is done by an agent or workflow. But that's because we're a new
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.520]   company, and we can make those decisions. But somebody who is
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.200]   an established company, I suspect that these that these
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.360]   gains are nominal at best, yet the spend is outrageous, and it
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.960]   gets okay. And when it catches up with you, when you report, I
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.480]   think the market is sort of like, I think the first, you
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.520]   know, the general statement might be made that perhaps the
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.400]   first AI mini bubble is bursting a bit. And particularly with
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.080]   respect to the accelerated expectations that public market
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.680]   investors had for public market technology stocks, that perhaps
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.400]   now is the time for a bit of a reckoning, that perhaps this
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.040]   isn't going to happen at the same margin level, or the pace
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.920]   that folks had modeled. And this is going to cause a bit of a
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.040]   setback. I think pace is a very good point you're making. I also
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.000]   think that with the GDP slowdown that we've seen report that just
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.160]   came out this week, with a sub 2% US GDP growth, we are seeing
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.560]   an economic slowdown underway, there is going to be reduced
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.040]   spending, there is going to be reduced conversion of enterprise
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.360]   customers to buy anything. And so that is going to dramatically
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.480]   affect the market, we're looking at 5% 30 year treasury rates,
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.040]   which means that you are going to see multiple compression,
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.400]   that's going to happen across the market for tech stocks. So
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.480]   this could be the beginning of what I think might be a slow
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.120]   contraction. One thing I just want to make sure I'm not a
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.400]   market. One thing to me, I do have some information on the
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.920]   Dell stuff. One thing to keep in mind is they had like a 30%
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:03.280]   run up, or 20% run up, at least since NVIDIA CEO praise them,
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.560]   and like, I guess all these meme stock people's just jumped in.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.600]   So I think it's just like a little ticky tacky correction
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.880]   back to the ticky tacky. sacks any final thoughts here on AI
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.600]   before we all leave to go to our you know, Trump celebrations
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.240]   and or yeah,
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.440]   maybe the market doesn't like the US becoming a banana
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:25.920]   republic.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.040]   There it is, folks.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:34.960]   I can still be friends with you guys. All right, everybody for
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.440]   who's you guys? Oh, you guys? I was talking to those guys.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.720]   All right, for two months, two missing buttons. We'd like to

[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:44.080]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.920]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.160]   sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
