[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   what's going on y'all it's another episode of curious mike i am here with chris brickley um
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.920]   it's an honor to have you on man you know there's very few people that i feel like their reputation
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.280]   is you know like yours to where there's nothing bad across the league across friends across people
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.360]   that work with you that have a negative thing to say about you and you know you're one of the best
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   trainers in the game so it's an honor to have you on and just chop it up no i appreciate that man
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.320]   been as you know i've been a fan of your game for years i've been we've been texting back and forth
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   i've been trying to get you in the gym uh that big fan of the game team puma you know both in the puma
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.960]   family but uh no thanks for having me yeah no doubt bro so brother like i was just um you know saying
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.520]   i feel like in your space there's always you know because there's so many trainers that are trying to
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.040]   you know get in the door with players and things like that so a lot of trainers i feel like have
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.560]   just good reputations from some people than other people have bad reviews bad reputations i feel like
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.600]   one of the things about you is there's not a player in the league a player you work with that has a
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   negative thing to say about you um how did you kind of cultivate that relationship with players to was
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240]   it just like are you i feel like you got to be very intentional in that space because that's one of
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280]   the things i really admire about you yeah no i first of all i appreciate that you know i've i've done
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.360]   a bunch of interviews and no one's ever like said that or broken that down so i appreciate that
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.880]   um i guess yeah i'm very very intentional with who i work with who i give my energy to
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.840]   uh i feel like i've always been big on you know every relationship either giving energy or you get
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.720]   energy and i've always been someone where i know my role and it's to give energy to players and to help
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.600]   players become the best version of themselves and uh so that's always been my role and i've always just
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.360]   dropped my ego when it comes to that and um so far it's you know it's been good it's been good for me
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.240]   it's amazing like tracing back early like let's get into the chris brickley story a little bit um
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.280]   you obviously hoop coming up you know you had a passion for hoop and then what was that like after
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.160]   high school i i think i read that you tried to walk on somewhere yeah and then from there was it just
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.600]   right into the training i um i actually had a guest on yesterday who said they knew you towards the
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.680]   beginning of your journey and they remember there were times where you were in the car like you were
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.240]   sleeping in the car yeah things like that and really just thugging it out so like those early days when
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.640]   you decided to transition what was that like yeah so okay so i grew up in new hampshire i hooped went to
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.560]   northeastern uh small division one school transferred to louisville as a walk-on uh and then at that point
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.440]   in my life i was like all right no chance of making the nba and i looked up to coach patino i was like damn this
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.160]   guy lives a great life he drives a cool car has money has a nice watch teaches the game of basketball
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.560]   also regardless of the reputation he teaches kids life like he was he's the best teacher i've ever had
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.720]   and so i wanted to be that so i wanted to get into coaching so i was like the youngest division one
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.520]   assistant coach in the country uh at fairly dickinson then um i took an internship with the knicks
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.840]   and then my intern year so i'm like the rebounder and then you know uh all of a sudden carmelo who
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.560]   was like in the prime of his career um took a liking to me and he said i want you to be my main trainer
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.720]   mid-season and that literally i was making 300 a week as an intern that changed the my entire life so
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.600]   then for four years i was with mellow year round we travel with them um got to know him really well
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.480]   through him got to know all these other players and then so i was with the next four years
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.480]   through four different coaches four different gms like we experienced a lot um then i was like okay i
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   could stay with the knicks i think if i leave though i've made enough connections through mellow i could
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.680]   start my own business and yeah i took a chance my family's like you're leaving health insurance
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.840]   you're leaving a guarantee guarantee check are you sure you want to do this
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   um looking back i'm like i don't even know why how i could even do that but uh somehow it worked out
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.320]   that's amazing um for like people that you know are aspiring to be or just break away from the norm the
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.080]   nine to five the the typical job and make something of themselves you have done that you gambled on
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.320]   yourself and it paid off um like what would you say to people that are teetering that edge of like
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   trying to play it safe versus try to like explore and see what they can make of their life so it's like
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.680]   you can't be you don't want to be delusional like at the same time but you also you want to believe in
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   yourself it's like a it is a fine line like um and i played that super close i feel like um so i left
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.360]   the knicks and i initially i was gonna sign this big deal with nike and so in the back of my mind i'm
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.520]   like okay i'm talking to a vp of nike i'm gonna sign this big deal in nike um long story short that guy
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   wanted to control my whole team all my childhood friends that would rebound for me and all that he's
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.680]   like no i don't want that i want this so i was like i'm not doing this two months go by i'm homeless
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.120]   don't have a home i go from i'm coaching with the knicks i'm gonna sign this big nike deal
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.440]   i turn it down and i'm in new york city at the yotel trying to get back in the room and they're like
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.160]   your credit card decline if i have no money left my my uh debit card this was like six seven years ago
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.800]   and uh i'm sleeping like where i do the runs now lifetime sky i'm like sleeping in like a side room
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.000]   that like i found for like a few months not telling anyone not even telling mellow and i did i had too
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.880]   much pride to tell him i had too much pride to tell the players um yeah and i just grinded it out i just
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   literally workout by workout i never really showed the players who i didn't i never told
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   them what was going on and uh kept doing my job assigned a manager signed with a manager who helped
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.360]   me get some deals and then that kind of changed everything it's amazing that's an amazing story
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.120]   um i feel like in the training space you know as a trainer as a basketball player there's only so many
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.280]   drills you can really do right there's so many people who are very knowledgeable about the game can
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.240]   break different things down but there's really only so many drills you can do and you have elevated
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.920]   over the last probably 10 to 15 years is like the you know the epitome of of what an nba trainer looks
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.440]   like um off the court and on the court you know how what do you feel like separates trainers from
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.360]   like average trainer from the best trainers because i feel like something you touched on is is the
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.080]   relationship you build in the energy you give off because like you were just saying when you were a
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.040]   ball boy or a intern with the knicks or just rebounding for players mellow at the prime of his
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.360]   career one of the most skilled players ever he wasn't even trying to rock with the quote unquote best
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.440]   trainer in the world at that time he was rocking with you and like you probably were just getting into
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.680]   i mean you probably knew what you were doing but like at the end of the day there's only so many drills you
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.560]   can do so how important is that relationship and kind of the energy trainers give off to players
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   in terms of elevating themselves it's everything so i think i learned that from phil jackson i feel
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.640]   so i was with the knicks that was an end of phil's career he took over the knicks as like president
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:53.280]   and so when he first got the job the whole staff's like oh everyone's done so the season ended we're doing
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.120]   exit meetings head coach goes in gets fired assistants going gets fired so i'm at the bottom of the line
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.640]   so i'll call my dad i'm like i'm about to get fired right now so i go into phil's office and feels like
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   he asked me three questions um by the grace of god i answered him in a way that he liked him and he's like
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:20.560]   i'm gonna keep you so he fired everyone on the staff kept me we developed a friendship me and phil and he
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   taught me when i was with the this is phil talking when i was with the bulls it wasn't about basketball
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.480]   it was about how i managed michael jordan and scotty pippen and dennis rodman and so then i was like damn
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:40.720]   so this whole basketball thing is like it's about managing players energy managing different players
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.240]   attitudes and like figuring that out and that's how you get the best of the players so i think i took a
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.640]   lot of that in into my training like you said obviously um you want the right drills but there's
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.880]   no magic drills um but yeah i think phil played a huge uh role in just my how i deal with players
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.440]   that's amazing so mellow you guys you guys are rocking you're kind of building your brand a
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.480]   little bit that way um when did it get to the point where so many players and just like how did you
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.360]   slowly because even when i met you a few years ago we met at some puma event yep um like it wasn't at
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   the level it is now you know what i mean and probably a few years prior to that it wasn't at the level it
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.680]   was then so like how did you slowly um kind of i mean you're in new york city the biggest market but
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.800]   from working with mellow to all these different players how did you slowly build that reputation
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   and that trust along the league yeah so i think so first off shout out to mellow and shout out to new
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.400]   york city i'd be delusional to be like in new york city didn't play a role or mellow didn't play a role
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.320]   i think through mellow i got a chance to work with katie and work with lebron and james and russ and these
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:59.920]   guys and just be able to spend time with them and um they got to see that i was coming from a genuine
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.120]   place um i knew i was talking about as far as like i wasn't bullshitting them about like
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.920]   uh i don't know you you know when someone's trying to talk to you about your game they really don't know
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   so i just i was i was always honest if a player asked me something that i i didn't know i'd be honest
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.480]   i don't know um so i think just being honest i think uh the new york city thing really helped
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.680]   i had a building a team around me i i uh signed with a manager that wasn't like part of a big agency
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:34.480]   he just worked for me he went and he did he's done a great job and got me a puma deal and bmw and 2k
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.920]   and all these things that i think have helped me with my career that's amazing i feel like also like
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.240]   as a player as an nba player one thing that really turns players off to trainers is when trainers try to
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.000]   act like the player needs them i remember like back in high school there were a couple trainers and a
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.920]   couple people that would approach me and this is i was already one of the best players in the country
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.800]   and they would be like if you work with me you could take from here to here yeah that's probably
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:10.080]   never was in your in your no no because you just know any nba player i've ever worked with they don't
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:18.960]   need me i didn't make them you do all the work right i'm just able to be part of your journey and be
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.880]   able to be able to literally i i i call it like this witnessing witnessing your journey be like
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.320]   yeah we do drills yeah we do film but you're the one doing all the work you're the one you get
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.480]   the injuries i don't deal with the injuries i don't deal with that you rehabbing uh all of that stuff
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.840]   uh i'm huge on that too i hate when people are like i hate when trainers like my player
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:49.040]   no like no like a player me and buddy were talking about it earlier today a player should be able to
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.320]   work with multiple trainers and that's fine that's okay it's like no trainer should be like don't work
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.360]   with anyone else just work with me i just uh yeah so to answer your question i think i've always just been
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:11.200]   been open to i show love to other trainers and um i understand that i didn't make any players that's
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   for sure yeah as you have elevated in that space and become you know who you are today i mean there's
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.960]   only one other person i can really think of that like has the on the court presence and off the court
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   social media presence as you do and that's like lethal shooter but he's more like skits a little bit
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.080]   and you're more like really just in the trenches in the gym with players every single day as you've
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.280]   elevated how have you maintained like because you come off very humble you come off and i feel like
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.120]   that has been part of the reason for your success but how have you maintained that to where like
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.880]   the simplicity of what got you to where you are today which was probably grinding it out in the gym
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:52.400]   every day you know talking to players hitting players up to get in the gym and just the simplicity of
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.720]   that how as you have rose kind of in in fame and just in notoriety how have you maintained like that
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.600]   humility and just that that grind and that work ethic because i i'm around a lot of people not only
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.880]   basketball players um but even like musicians and other people who once they kind of taste that
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.600]   success of what of what money and fame and all this stuff gets them they lose that like desire to
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   every single day wake up early get in the gym do it again how have you maintained that that's actually
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.000]   the way you broke that down this the the simplicity of like it's like how did i get to where i got to
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.200]   it's just every day getting in getting in the gym working with players building day by day
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:40.400]   day after day after day after day it's like no magic but so to answer your question yeah for sure i
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.080]   i went in my 20s and um i never had over 20 000 in my bank account and then you know you get
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.120]   to your 30s and i i have seven figures in my bank account um and then like people might ask me for
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.680]   pictures or and so like yeah that's for sure different that was never the plan ever that was
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:04.080]   never the plan so i have like little things that i do like for example i have humility on my finger but
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:11.280]   some that i do a lot um next knows this is i get in my car and i drive to where i used to live when i was
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.800]   struggling where i lived when i coached fdu in new jersey and i go on these drives and i take myself
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.720]   back to where i was seven eight years ago mentally and just to stay grounded you know um i think that
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.400]   that's like huge that's like my thing just driving back and trying to put myself myself in those places
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   yeah no i think that's an amazing tool like taking yourself out of kind of this luxurious lifestyle
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.120]   and putting yourself kind of back in the grind back in the trenches like i remember before the
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   bubble happened all the gyms were shut down um like we couldn't get in the nuggets facility i couldn't
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.200]   get in any of the nice gyms but there was one gym it was like a little shack and i would call it the
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.400]   trenches and they opened it up for me and they would let me in there and then i remember
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.000]   me breaking out as a player in the nba was when i went to the bubble yeah and i was for sure
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.360]   consistently putting up like 30 games straight but i didn't have a state-of-the-art gym i didn't have
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.840]   state-of-the-art recovery it was putting myself back in kind of those those hard spaces and i feel
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:17.040]   like intentionally doing that is there's got to be like some some benefit to that so true so true that
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.320]   that's actually dope to hear because you you're the way you put in the bubble was i feel like that was
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.560]   like you're like okay this guy is gonna be in the nba for a long time yeah that was like post injury
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.240]   like for sure rehab that whole first year of my nba career um that second year like i kind of started
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.520]   off okay but it was it was kind of slow i was you know sharing minutes with malik beasley tory craig
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.120]   wancho um you know there was like four or five of us that coach was yeah and then the bubble happened
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   that was like the the break in the middle of the season and i got so lucky because i got to start
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   pretty early because guys had covet so they weren't and then i got to to break out in the in the bubble
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.880]   but um a bunch of 20 plus games yeah yeah i remember that i definitely remember that but yeah no so i think
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.600]   that's huge putting your so actually just recently this is actually kind of funny a little off topic
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.880]   so um i have a girlfriend right uh we've been dating for like i don't know a year and a half which so
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   she she lives like uh by massive square garden and she lives with like some roommates
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:32.080]   the play it's not really in the best area it's like their apartments like kind of grimy it's just like
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.760]   sorry lexi but um and so i would do this thing where and like you know i so i live where where the
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.480]   gym is i live in the summit i live in like a penthouse i would do this thing where i would i would go to
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:52.640]   her house i'd like sleep over and she'd go to work and i would like spend for as long as i could
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.960]   in her like this like old crib that like just like in the middle of the winter it's like freezing cold
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:08.240]   i'm like don't go get food i'm like i'm like starving myself i'm like almost like taking myself back this
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:14.000]   is like recently i'm i'm taking myself back to the days where like i didn't have money to eat and i just
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   didn't have money to do anything luxurious and i would like do i would stay in her crib as long as i could
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.600]   so i was so uncomfortable i was i'm hungry like what the am i doing and and i feel like that like
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.160]   helped that helps like getting yourself uncomfortable kind of like what you're talking about about the
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.720]   gym yeah no that's such an underrated like tactic to increase mental strength and to increase like
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:44.240]   resiliency and all that is on purpose go put yourself uncomfortable uncomfortable position for sure
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.280]   and that can be as simple as waking up and you want to get in the hot shower go turn on a cold shower
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.480]   for sure or go get in the cold tub or do you know when you feel like doing this do something else on
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.000]   purpose and like that really can build you know build your mind in a way that and like there was
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.520]   um i watched the interview actually david goggins had an interview with andrew huberman i don't know
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.120]   if you know who that is yeah um but they talked about this this part in your brain that only grows
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.200]   when you do uncomfortable things like that's the only time that it grows is when you
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.600]   do uncomfortable things on purpose and you accomplish those things so what you're saying
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.880]   of putting yourself back in those shoes of when you didn't have much and you didn't have much money
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.520]   and doing that on purpose that as you climb in life i feel like that's that's important yeah no for
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.880]   sure the the my yeah the mindset just having that mindset i have a question for you um what what is
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:48.880]   your go-to during your playing career when moments when you're not shooting good you're not playing
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.160]   good do you do anything different or do you keep your routine the same when i'm not shooting good or not
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.960]   playing good um i try to keep my routine very similar if anything i'll go in the evenings and really just
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.280]   try to like like get my form and my go back to like really basic things yep um but like off of the
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:16.880]   court mental wise i have to like if i'm you know if i'm kind of like in the mix a little bit during the
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.680]   season hanging out going to dinners for me personally i have to like alone time is really important so i
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.960]   get back to spending like time alone and time time reading books times journaling times of
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.680]   getting that because we all like in this line of work the physical part of things is very easy
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   so going to the gym lifting weights all that stuff is easy for me so during those hard times i have to
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.920]   on purpose like go to like the mental gym and like do things that i don't normally do which is
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.560]   journaling some meditation some prayer so that i can try to get that like feeling of heaviness yeah
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   that feeling of whatever off of me so then i can go into the game and just feel like man like
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.240]   i can i can have a quick i can have a quick memory even if i miss like i'm free out there i feel
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.600]   loose i feel free i don't feel this pressure that's dope man that i hope someone clips that for players
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.880]   out there i feel like that's that's such a big thing players get stuck in there they don't know how to
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.520]   get out of it they don't know how to get to that journaling or being alone or they can't figure that
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.640]   part out and sometimes that's why players can't get to that next level i think i mean honestly for me
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.560]   though it goes back to faith like i like my faith in god because if you can get out quickly of like
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:35.280]   trying to perform to to appease your coaches or trying to perform to for your own or the approval of
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.960]   the fans or your own if you can get out of that and kind of get back to the joy of the game playing
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:46.400]   for the passion of the game playing for you know god you know being grateful for the gate the gifts
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   he's giving you and and going out there with that mindset that's a completely different mindset than
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.640]   the than the previous one which is probably going to you know make fear come into your mind you're
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.040]   going to feel the pressure of shots when you can get into like the grateful mindset thanking god for
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.080]   the talent he gave you and the fact that you're able to go out there and play and be healthy that
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.280]   to me is a way to kind of get some of like i just said some of that unnecessary pressure off that's so
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:19.120]   true that's so true when things uh to play off that when things i feel like aren't going good in my life
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   whether relationships or whatever i those are the times where i'm like when i pray and i'm saying thank
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.440]   you the most yeah for whatever reason i think i've always been like that yeah that's fine yeah
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.960]   well you're doing so well on the court and everything but you're doing equally as well
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.600]   off of the court with the um you know the new age of social media and the influence that you can have
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.840]   in that way um how did you really because you're one of the first guys that really paid attention to
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:52.320]   really like the content game is there as a as a trainer how did you kind of like see into that world
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.160]   before it became such a big thing and how have you grown that so i feel like in the beginning i was
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.960]   getting like killed for it because like you know mellow was like yo let's start putting content out
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:11.120]   and um it was looked at almost like oh he's just trying to show new york that he's working hard or
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   he's not and mellow's real reason for that was he wanted to inspire younger basketball players to show
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.880]   them like what he was doing so then we started recording and then now jr so mellow and jr were
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.720]   close and then me and jr started recording then we started doing runs and then we started recording that
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:37.120]   and um a lot of negative negativity came from that because it was like oh you're only doing workouts
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:44.880]   to film them or you're only but it's like no we actually did like 50 workouts and i posted 45 seconds
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:54.960]   of one yeah um and so now i feel like it's a little bit more more more players post content so uh there's
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.520]   not as much negative negative vibes with it but at first i felt like that was a negative connotation with
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.840]   it it's kind of cool too the way you do it because even in the runs or even in the basketball workouts it
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.800]   looks like it's shot from like an iphone like very oh yeah um it's not like you know some of these super
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.440]   curated like uh creative directed things that like are mixtapes it's like no you're just showing the
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.080]   work on on a phone show i've always been super mindful of that i've always definitely been super
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.600]   mindful of that and i understand the whole no one ever misses and and it's like i'm gonna look at the
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.360]   camera what do you want so you want to watch the player miss 10 shots in a row i just don't i never
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.640]   understood that like criticized for yeah for sure uh definitely definitely they're like why aren't
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:43.120]   you doing defensive drills it's like so you want me to post a video of them of a player doing defensive
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.440]   slides it's strange if they try to nitpick just to try to pull out the the negative but if they even
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.840]   think for themselves like what would they enjoy watching what is a young basketball player he wants
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.800]   to watch mellow you know get in the mid post and kill these guys in your workout they want to watch clay
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.000]   thompson shoot and make 73s from the corner in a row like they like like i don't understand
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.400]   it's really the society we live in because you can be doing everything by the book being the most
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.440]   authentic person people are still going to find a way to twist that for sure that's inevitable that's
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.120]   the world we live in yeah um besides like the social media thing you have been one of the first
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:26.400]   trainers to really get some of these big endorsement deals you know the puma one um among other things how
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   how did those things come about you mentioned something earlier that you have a guy that
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.200]   doesn't work with a lot of people he works for you and he's out there hustling and yeah these things
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.360]   done how did some of those things come about yeah so i left the knicks i was like struggling i was like
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:46.560]   into the nike thing um had a good summer like it was like four weeks after the calves
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.160]   i played the words in the finals i had like lebron and katie playing in a run against each other guarding
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.520]   each other right after and so like that was a big moment um so i had all these big agencies that wanted
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.720]   to meet with me i had this one guy that was emailing me every week and i was like i'm gonna take this
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.120]   meeting i took the meeting and he's like i promise you like i'm gonna be loyal to you i'm gonna do
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   everything i can to help build you know so i was like all right let's do this and he got me the puma
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:20.000]   deal and i think getting a sneaker deal is huge so that led to body armor which led to bmw and tiffany's
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.360]   and bose and therabody and you know it's been a blessing it's been a blessing even you you even um
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.560]   you even what you would call it in the 2k yeah yeah 2k that was a huge moment i feel like uh
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:40.880]   i guess my popularity having like brickley's gym in there like that became a thing where i you know
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.280]   every every time i went to the airport it'd be like oh i play with you in the video game or there'd be
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.840]   people online being like i didn't know chris brickley was a real person i thought he was just a video game
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   so that's a really cool shout out to 2k for that all that's just uh i'm super thankful but that's not why
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:03.120]   i got into what i got into we could take all that away and we could uh put my bank account
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.320]   at ten thousand dollars and i'm still gonna do what i'm doing i'm not i'm not doing it strictly for
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   deals or for money or i actually love developing basketball players it's fun it's a it's a passion
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   it's cool seeing the progress it's cool watching the game and being like damn like the last last past
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.840]   summer we were working on that and now that's not me taking credit but it's me just being part of your
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.480]   journey part of a player's journey i think that that's what that makes me fulfilled that's dope
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   man you obviously got the very distinct look with the tats going on you know i mean when people see
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.480]   chris brickley they know who it is when did um when did that come about was it when you were a young
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.200]   intern was that the was that the vibe or did that kind of man so i was super self-conscious with this
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.520]   so when i was with the knicks i started slowly getting tattoos i'd go with jr and so oh you're hanging out
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.760]   jr that's that's how you got tight for sure so i started getting them but i wouldn't show them so
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.200]   it got to a point where like i just have a pair so i wear t-shirts every day so it got to a point
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.280]   my last year with the next this is uh i've never said this on any interview we're in vegas summer league
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:13.920]   and now at this point i have like my legs and i have like my forearms we uh going to summer league
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.360]   practice in vegas i don't want to show my tattoos i don't want anyone to have them so and it's 115
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.840]   degrees i have on my next polo with the long sleeve i have on the like the knicks practice shorts with
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:31.680]   like the spandex and and i'm just going every practice like that sweating like and coach i remember
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   the coach is like yo why do you have long sleeves in here and i just didn't want to and then one day i'm
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.840]   in the locker room in at the next facility i'm changing phil jackson walks in and he saw my tattoos
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:52.480]   and i was like oh my god and he's like just be you that's literally all he said we didn't talk about
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:58.160]   the tattoos yeah but he i knew what he was talking about and i was like so i literally ended up getting
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:06.720]   be you on my on my arm and i was like yeah it i'm just gonna be myself and and i just from that point
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.920]   on i i stopped trying on the same with the tats yeah is there a chance that eminem was your favorite
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   rapper growing up no no he wasn't eminem what i liked eminem i liked eminem i was eminem fan

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:16.000]   got just guys on the team he's like no anyone you can find so i reach out to guys i get kd i get um
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.680]   kimball walker at the time uh i was like lance stevenson it was a good group of guys we do this
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:28.240]   run but i'm coaching with the knicks do the run someone else posted it i walk into the office they're
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:35.520]   like you need to go talk to um donovan the owner like you got you you can't be doing stuff like that
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   i'm like damn so i drive from terrytown to madison square garden to walk into the owner's office and
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.520]   he's like i'm making sixty thousand dollars a year he's like you know you're doing that run just got
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.160]   the team fine fifty thousand dollars right and i'm like damn and i'm thinking i'm about to get fired
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:04.080]   and he's like you know just don't do it again i'm not mad at you um but what was the problem with it
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.200]   because if you're a coach if you're a coach with a team you you're not allowed to technically work with
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   it'd be recruiting it'd be a recruiting perfect right so uh yeah that was like the first ever run
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.360]   technically so then i stopped doing it and then that was also part of the reason why i left the
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.560]   knicks i was like okay i like i want to be able to do my own thing like that so that was the first ever
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:33.200]   run the hoodie mellow thing how that came about was um so mellow's that me me and mellow have two
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.080]   different uh stories um i remember mellow was going through a time in new york where
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.400]   playing for the knicks isn't easy if you're not winning championships which they haven't been and
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.680]   you're the franchise player they're they're gonna be on you especially if you're not making big player
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.000]   friends when we're in the gym he didn't want to be bothered he didn't want anyone coming up to him
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.840]   hey mellow come hello blah blah so he put a hood on and that was him being like don't talk to me
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.760]   not to me but to anyone that were to walk to the gym and we just started working out and we were
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.680]   posting and he had the hood on and then that just became a thing and then uh that was how it started
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   and then i think the nba implemented hoods that next season it was kind of crazy that that time was
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:24.960]   oh yeah they implemented the the warm-ups yeah that's fire um who have you seen walk through that
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:32.720]   gym that to you is well first let's ask like who are the most impressive players um with the most
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.000]   impressive work ethic is it does it correlate to how the world sees them like is lebron the lebrons and
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.120]   the kds also the hardest workers or who's some guys that you've seen that are just so yeah like
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.560]   they it's like they are the hardest workers like lebron you know we'll schedule eight o'clock workout
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   eight a.m and every single time we've ever worked out he shows up at 6 a.m and he stretches for an
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:05.200]   hour and then there's abs and then then lifts and every single time if there's a run at 10 he's getting
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.240]   there at eight like so it's it's tough not to say him yeah he's he's 40 years old and he's still in the league
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:19.520]   and he's still averaging 27 whatever a game so it's tough not to say him and it's tough not to say
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.880]   kd it's like we've every time i've ever worked with him he's he's gone game speed everything we've ever
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:31.040]   done i can't ever remember a moment where he's like had a moment in the workout where or a day where he
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.240]   didn't want to go like really hard and so i think it like correlates to like yeah i think those have
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.960]   been like to me those have been the most impressive guys and yeah that's not the best answer but yeah
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.160]   i mean no but it's there's no secret to success like everybody's heard the lebron stories of how
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.040]   dedicated he is to his craft but to hear it from you know a guy that works with him often and just
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.840]   every single time showing up two hours before taking care of his body i mean there's a reason
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.240]   that guy's not only been as successful as he is but how long he's done it like a body a human body at
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.440]   that age is not supposed to be doing what lebron for sure for sure and just recently so he started like
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.760]   the podcast i thought it was interesting he said i think steve nash was like why do you get there early
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   he was like ever since the little kid whenever he had to practice if he made if he cut it too close
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.680]   he would get really anxious and so i think because of that that made him start to get there early and so
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:35.200]   that's that's like so that's so deep to think about that like so because him cutting anything close made
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:41.600]   him anxious that would make him want to get to places really early and now he's lebron right now he's
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   lebron now he's you got austin reeves saying that he he's trying to beat lebron to the to the the
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   facility before a game and lebron still shows up before and like lebron will show five four or five
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.720]   hours before the game it's crazy like he has dedicated his entire existence to being great and it's really
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:07.280]   like it's really inspiring at some point they're gonna have to like when you talk about the the lebron
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.880]   mj debate you got to account for the longevity at some point for sure like you know sure it's
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.960]   unbelievable who's someone who like is like an underrated well a player that maybe hasn't like
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.480]   broke through all the way to their potential but like you've seen them in the gym and they're just
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.760]   very very impressed yeah and i guess there's like different levels of it like i feel like cj mccomb
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.680]   should have been all-star at some point in his career yeah oh he hasn't been you know he's averaged 20
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:40.000]   points in the game for i want to say like i don't even know 13 straight seasons 14 straight seasons
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.960]   never been an all-star i feel like he's a guy that you know he's so good like ridiculously skilled
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:55.840]   i think he doesn't get his flowers still averaging 22 on like 40 from three um yeah i think that's a good
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   one yeah because he got he got every dribble move he got the left hand the right hand the midi he got the
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.080]   three ball he got the he has and he's doing all that without being like a supreme athlete you know
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:11.600]   one which is awesome you're right about that always very impressive to me um you've also worked with
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   my boy trey young yep i told him the other day when we did a workout together i was like
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.320]   isn't it weird trade to think that like at your size and at your height you are the best player in
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.400]   the world like like you know you got the jalen brunson's and the kyrie's but they're a little
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.600]   stocker a little stronger you kind of bump people yeah pound for pound pound he's the best player in
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.480]   the world and for sure that is someone who um the average person who has big dreams to be an nba
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.720]   player you know you can look at trey you could probably look at like peyton pritchard uh maybe
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.080]   a couple other guys and be like that's that's reasonable for me so like as far as trey goes i
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.680]   know you've worked with him a lot this off season what is what is it like getting in the gym with him
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.840]   i feel like so special do you agree i feel like the appreciation for trey and i don't know what it
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:05.440]   is maybe it's atlanta this is this situation maybe it's but every single season he
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:11.920]   puts up phenomenal numbers it's the worst i've ever seen of any player in the history of people almost
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.600]   like he doesn't get picked you know he made the all-star but i think someone got injured and he
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.000]   but i'm like what else does this guy have to do to get like the respect that he deserves like now yes
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.040]   he he's trey young he you know has a great contract he's but i i still i feel like he doesn't get the
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.800]   appreciation to the point that he deserves i mean there's there's there's years where he's top five and
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.000]   scoring and assists like often like for sure he's one of the best scorers in the game and he's also
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.040]   one of the best playmakers like 100 and he's six one six two and super like so i don't know what it
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.080]   is i don't know if it's that early on he kind of took on that villain that villain role you know coming
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.200]   to new york and and getting on new york's bad side sure killing the knicks and things like that i don't
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:05.440]   know if that's it but there was a year that it was like he easily should have been an all-star like
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.760]   yes didn't get it i forget what year it was and then like there was a year he was but it was because
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   someone got injured like you said so i don't know what it is with trade to me it's it's like they should
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.800]   be hyping that up more because of the fact that he's he's an average you're right so relatable like
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:29.440]   so related my boy next like like like the people like that are regular height and yes trey's quick
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   don't get me wrong and like uh but like just like normal people walking around like could look at trey
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.360]   young and be like like that could be me i thought caitlyn clark has that effect i think that's part of
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:49.040]   why she became so big because she was like someone that's people could relate to yeah 100 who um how do you
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.560]   as a trainer decide who you're willing to work with because i feel like um it's i mean if i was
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.040]   a trainer i would probably be like as long as they're willing to work hard and be consistent whatever
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.480]   but for you what is it so it's changed so in the when i first started like six years ago when i first
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.200]   left the next i'm taking anybody so if you're in the league i'm taking you um it's over the last two or
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.720]   three years it's it's been a like i have to like your game i have to think that i can help you somehow
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:27.120]   or there's something that i've worked with a player that maybe has been similar to you or there needs to
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:34.400]   be something where i feel like i could bring to the table that um it really bothers me when a player just
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:41.600]   wants to work out for videos on my social media um and i would never say the names of any of those guys
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.840]   but that's been some disappointing moments in my career where me and a guy will start working out
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:56.240]   and on like the second workout he's like jay you're gonna post that video i was like yo and then like we
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   slowly like you won't see me with him working with him anymore because i'm like that's not what it
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.560]   should be about it's funny that normally the trainers would would try to link up with players for the for
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.640]   the clout but you've gotten to the point now where certain players will try to link up with you and get
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:19.520]   a video posted because you've elevated to that level which is no it is but it's like i talk about this
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.440]   with my and it's like my manager's probably gonna be so mad i'm saying this having a video okay so if
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.720]   you're a free agent having a video on my page it's not gonna it's not gonna get you picked on the team
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.960]   yeah it's not gonna happen yeah some players think that it's that's just not the case uh i
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.440]   couldn't stress that enough like i i want to work to get better to help you get better but a video on
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:49.680]   social media that's 45 seconds long is not gonna make a team want to pick you in my opinion maybe i'm
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.280]   wrong there's one player i want to i want to speak about because i feel like i can relate to him and he's
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:02.400]   gotten also some unfair criticism and you've witnessed him up close and that's ben simmons um you've seen
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.840]   him in the black ops runs going crazy dunking off the left foot the right foot playmaking you've seen
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:14.640]   his explosion end to end and the reason that i like i feel for ben in his situation is because
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.680]   i haven't gone through what he's gone through times three i think i've had three back surgeries he may have
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.880]   had one or two yeah but i know how that you know i know that story and how demoralizing that is and
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:33.440]   how like you know your mind has to become very resilient very strong and you have to adapt your
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.800]   game a little bit and you have to be very dedicated but for the people that say like ben simmons doesn't
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.040]   care about basketball or he lost all his confidence or um like what would you say to them because
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.800]   you've been in the gym with him and you've seen him like kind of in that era where he was just unreal
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   for sure exactly i've seen him when he like before his like injury before his like essentially it was
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:07.440]   his back and but those are real injuries yeah that he want he wanted to be healthy like he didn't want
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:14.720]   to be not healthy like and i salute you like i don't know how you've done it i know you talked about
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.600]   journaling and you've talked about being alone and spending alone time and but to go through like
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:26.400]   three you've had three back surgeries back for all of them and to come back and still be an elite elite
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:33.520]   level player like you deserve all the flowers in the world for that like your average person walking
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:39.440]   around doesn't understand and even i haven't gotten the surgery so i i don't quite but i've been around
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:46.240]   players to see you have to work times five to after that like compared to what the average player has
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.280]   to work and like take care of their body and watch their diet and do their recovery it's it's times five
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:57.440]   or ten for me for sure like i literally had to go from being a player that likes to drive right to a
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   player that prefers to go left i had to go from a player like like there's so many little things that
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.280]   people don't know about my story that what was the toughest one to bounce back from so the first
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   one i had at mizzou and i actually i actually hurt my back probably sophomore year of high
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.880]   school playing with trey young and you were number one and you you're number one in the country number
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.720]   one in the world at this point um for my projected number one in nba jack number one draft pick best
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:30.080]   player in the country so all those things and trey can attest to this like we were in practice with
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:36.960]   mo can you know and i'm a sophomore it's a sophomore summer going into junior year and we're in practice
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.200]   i'm going up i'm like back then like my balance was od so i'm going up dunking about to dunk on
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   to do baseline he runs by me grabs my like like arm and air and you've seen those videos of people like
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   falling on their back really high right yep and that's what happened the wing got knocked out of me
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.720]   and like whatever it took me a second to get up but i got up and my back felt a little like like
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.320]   off right but nothing crazy so i didn't give it proper time to recover from there i think i played in the
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.840]   game the very next day okay but i think i started compensating for like little pains in my back and
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:14.800]   um there was like some soreness and then i went to go see like a chiropractor or something or a doctor
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.960]   maybe a few months later when kind of that that feeling wasn't ever right in my back again and
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:28.560]   they said i had degenerative disc disease right they did an x-ray and i didn't like at this point now i'm
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.080]   like an expert with the bat because i've gone through so much first time i had no idea what
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.400]   that meant he said degenerative disc disease and i was like like my mind this is why i talk about the
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.200]   power of the mind it automatically went to fear i'm like oh no like i'm broken like i'm degenerating like
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.720]   this is a disease i didn't know that every single person on the planet and especially if you're an athlete
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.480]   as you age those discs become like if you if you mri any basketball player yeah their mri is going to
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.080]   come back a little abnormal we're 6 10 we're moving crazy like i didn't know that at the time so this
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   implanted like a bunch of fear in my mind and from there for some reason the pain got worse like i i
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.360]   don't think it was a physical thing i think it was the mind so now my junior year comes along like i'm
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.080]   still progressing as a player i'm still the number one player in the world but um i'm still feeling my
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.320]   back senior year comes along same thing i'm playing under brandon rory we're the best team in the
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.800]   country i'm the best player but my back is still bothering me every day i'm starting to get like
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.640]   so you're still being the number so you're still maintaining the number one spot and i'm like every
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:38.000]   day and you're not at 100 percent that's actually crazy right there i know like there was a lot of
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.400]   stiffness in my back but then i committed to mizzou and i remember i kept during this whole time trying
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.600]   to see different therapists different chiropractors and all these things i saw one chiropractor at mizzou and
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.400]   they did some weird crack on my back and then the pain went from like my back to down my leg and
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.200]   i'm sure you've talked to like ben or people that have been in that situation where they get that
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.160]   nerve pain i started to get this weird nerve pain but the doctor the chiropractor said that's just new
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.840]   muscles turning on so i let that i let that ride out for a few days but the first game at mizzou sold
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.720]   out crowd is in three days and i'm dealing with this weird nerve pain and then like i'm waking up
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.520]   every day and my leg looks like it's getting a little small like it's atrophying like the damn
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.920]   so now i'm going into this this first game in mizzou and i'm like i'm expected to put on show you
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.480]   know when i committed to mizzou the attendance of the school rose by thousands just because of my
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.320]   commitment so i'm feeling all this pressure to perform but my leg isn't working right i'm trying
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.680]   to jump and i'm i'm not getting off the ground really and so i tell my dad in the warm-ups of that
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.800]   game like yo dad like i can't i can't play like i don't know what's going on with my leg and my back
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.320]   but i i can't jump in warm-ups like i don't know what's going on and so they told me i had to start
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:55.120]   the game because it was a big tv production and they already had the starting lineup yeah um ready so i
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.080]   had to start the game and i came out a minute into the game and that was my pretty much my college
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.720]   experience so then i get on the phone with my agent and i'm like because he's watching the game
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.320]   expecting and then he's um he tells me to try to walk on my heels a certain way and i can't do it
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.640]   on the on that left side right because that nerve was damaged it wasn't sending the signal down to
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.560]   my muscle which was the reason for the for the atrophying um so i end up getting it having to get
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.840]   that first surgery that month later um and then from there you know i didn't know how to rehab it
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.880]   properly ended up getting my second surgery once i got drafted by by denver and this is a whole drawn-out
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.800]   story but at this point i've had three back surgeries i've had to learn how to go through
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.880]   each one of these and figure out my body a little bit more just to try to stay healthy
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.920]   and try to like compensate for different movements and different ways that i would naturally like to
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:54.400]   flow and play but because of the injuries i've had to adjust no player i feel like in the history of
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.520]   the nba has had to compensate and learn how to be effective in different ways essentially play
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.320]   different like playing what your mind wants to sometimes yeah literally like on the court people
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.880]   be like why aren't you smiling why aren't you like getting hype when you make a three why aren't you
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.920]   whatever and it's literally because i'm having to think about so many technicalities and how i i can't
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:19.120]   just lose myself in the game and just that's actually crazy i have to think so much more than i used to
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:25.600]   which um you know it goes back to those things where you gotta you gotta choose the things you're
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.720]   gonna be grateful for and you have to reflect and at this point in my life i always talk about you know
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.840]   at this point i can genuinely look back on some of those hard experiences and look at them as a blessing
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:42.240]   but my story is very unique i haven't really told it to the to the world in the way that i would like to
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.360]   like in detail because people won't understand they'll just but it's it's tough that's why i
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.080]   brought up ben because i just feel for him because like it's not like he wants to be in a situation not
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.400]   like he doesn't want to play basketball he went through some very similar things that i went through
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:02.160]   and i know how hard that is and people act like he just doesn't want to go hoop i know no and that's
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:09.440]   that's not that's not the case right that's not the case no um yeah even this past year uh like six
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:19.600]   in the morning we would begin working he was trying to get back right um yeah and he did his body wasn't
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:26.000]   right his body wasn't right when you have the fans they make their own narrative and it's just like
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.400]   you know what's strange though people talk we were just talking about the mind the way i've the way
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:37.840]   these last few seasons i missed no games because my back this past year i played 79 games i missed
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.560]   three because of a little hamstring thing the year before that i played 81 games the only game i didn't
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.000]   play was because of i forgot like the the team forgot my right the right shoes okay so i would
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:55.120]   have played 82. the way that i got my back to be stable and to be healthy had nothing to do with
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.560]   um doing the right recovery doing the right stuff in the weight room that had a part to play it
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:05.200]   literally was the mind it literally was learning how to we hold we i used to think it was so taboo
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.920]   when they would say that you could hold fear and hold different emotions in your tissues in your body
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.640]   some people holding their neck or some people get migraines or some people when i learned how to
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.680]   release these like repressed emotions and this tension that i hold in my body my back never had an issue
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:25.840]   yeah that that that's deep and then that's so true though it's so that is that the power of the mind
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:34.800]   it really is way more powerful than yeah than even we think like yeah even like we're talking about it
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.680]   now and i think it's even more powerful than that because it has to do with not only your physical body
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.080]   but also like what you were talking about when you go through a shooting slump how do you handle that
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.400]   mentally it doesn't have to do with your physical mechanics a lot of time it has to do with what
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.640]   you're what you're holding in your your mind and stuff so that's a whole other conversation we can
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.160]   have i actually had a brain expert on here that we uh that we haven't released the episode yet but
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.040]   following this episode like i'll probably put that one out you definitely should that'd be fire
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.960]   um i know i've kept you here for a while but for you last couple questions like when do you see
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:15.680]   yourself kind of transitioning from this training role and like when what do you see as being next
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.000]   for you once that happens i feel like you're probably a basketball junkie wants to do it 20 more years
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.880]   yeah so i mean in the moment now like i'm riding it out while i can you know make this brand money
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   like if i'm in a situation where i don't have to go to the player and be like give him some crazy
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.480]   invoice like i don't have to do that i'm in a blessed situation where these companies i can make my money
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.360]   through these companies i can work with the players that i genuinely want to work with and i have genuine
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:49.680]   relationships with and so as long as i can do that i know that's not going to last forever i'm mindful
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.280]   that as you get older you're not as cool i understand life so i'm going to ride out the
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.840]   wave that i'm on right now and um once that day comes then i don't know maybe i'll get back into
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:08.960]   nba coaching um maybe college coaching something like that but right now i'm just going to ride it out
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.280]   that's fire leave the audience with one last thing because i i really respect your kind of journey
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:22.400]   like kind of like self-made and and really you made this whole brand and your whole life based
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.520]   on the relationships you made and the work ethic you had and the consistency so i feel like a lot of
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.720]   people especially in this day and age that are so caught up in looking at other people's lives through a
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:40.320]   phone they need they need some some words of wisdom and some like motivation and inspiration for people
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.960]   that come from nothing you spent times being homeless and now you made it to where you are today so just
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.800]   leave leave leave a little tidbit of wisdom for yeah i would just say just consistency i would say
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:52:00.480]   you know whether someone just learns about my story now it took 10 years of like
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:10.640]   not being comfortable of uh eating rum and noodles uh for dinner for so many years um just like being
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:16.960]   uncomfortable but i knew what i loved i knew i loved basketball and so just find something you love
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:24.240]   don't do it for the money and just grind it out like literally grind it out find something you love
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:32.000]   be a good person grind it out and have faith thank god and i think good things will happen see where
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   it takes you that's why words and this is really as simple as that um people are complicated but it's
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.160]   very simple and i like what you said find that passion find something you have a passion for that
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.960]   you love and then from there it's the consistency and the growth and spending time at it every day and
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.200]   attacking it from different angles and and then you know you can end up somewhere like where you're at
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.960]   man but this has been an amazing episode i i haven't sat down and talked like hoop in a while because
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.760]   with this podcast i like to branch off and do not for sure it's dope though i've watched it i've
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.400]   watched almost all of them and i think what you're doing is dope that's fine man but it was an honor
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.960]   to have you on bro and i appreciate you my guy yes sir thank you curious mike out y'all
