[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   This is very good news for Sinema, what just happened in the last couple minutes.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.120]   Kirsten Sinema has been declared the winner.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.040]   This is the first time that a Democrat will have won a Senate seat in Arizona since 1976.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   The first woman ever to serve as senator in Arizona.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.840]   So it's a very big deal.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.920]   Censured by the Arizona Democratic Party, Kirsten Sinema announcing she's leaving the Democratic Party.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.680]   She's going to be leaving the Senate.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.960]   If you ever meet someone with whom you agree 100 percent, either they're a liar
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   or you're not thinking for yourself.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Senator Sinema.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.240]   Thanks for coming.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.080]   Absolutely.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.440]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.640]   How are you?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.840]   Hey, it's good to see you.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.760]   Alright, well I think you heard J.D.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   I listened to some of it.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.440]   You listened to some of it?
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.880]   Yeah, I listened to the whole thing.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.680]   What's your take on J.D. and, you know, if he were to be called on to be president,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   which is the nature of that job, God forbid, for whatever reason,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.480]   how do you think he would do as president?
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.280]   Well, first let me say J.D. and I have been friends for quite some time.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.560]   You know, we served together in the Senate.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.000]   We have a great relationship.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.040]   We don't agree on everything.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.640]   What I really appreciate about J.D. is that it doesn't bother him that we don't agree on everything.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.760]   Right?
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.360]   I know that sounds strange, but...
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   Not here.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   Right.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.800]   I mean, yeah, obviously, you guys.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.560]   There's this thing that I think is kind of disturbing that's happened in American politics,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.120]   and it's this idea that you either have to agree with someone 100% of the time,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.080]   or they are your mortal enemy and must be destroyed.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.600]   Right.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.320]   And the two parties actually talk about each other in this, like, existential threat way, right?
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.840]   Like the only way the country will be safe is if we completely eliminate the existence of the other party.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.880]   But if you think about that, that's actually incredibly dangerous, right?
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   It's incredibly dangerous.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   To have one party?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   Yes.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   It's called China and Russia.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   Exactly.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   That's exactly right.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.080]   So, what we really want in this country, what I really want, is a robust marketplace of
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.760]   ideas, and not only the idea that you can tolerate that someone else has an idea different
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.920]   than your own, but that you can welcome the idea that someone has a different idea than
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   your own.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.400]   Because you might, I know this sounds crazy, learn from that other idea, and over time
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.120]   change or grow your opinions.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   It's an opportunity.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.520]   And so, that's one of my favorite things about J.D., is that he and I have areas where we
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.240]   share opinion very closely, and we have areas where we don't share the same opinion.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.760]   And it's not a problem at all.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.520]   Like, we're both comfortable with the idea of difference of opinion.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.800]   I think that's core to the idea of who you want in a leader.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   Why has that happened?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880]   So, why have we found ourselves in a place where we are intolerant of the other party's
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.560]   ideas and we are intolerant of members of the other party?
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   Well...
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.320]   What's driven this change?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.440]   I will say that the term "we" doesn't apply to me, obviously, because when people told
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.720]   me to do that, I was like, "Yeah, no, I'm not going to do that at all," and they were
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   like, "You're excused."
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Right.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   Right.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   And for those who don't know your background, you left the Democratic Party.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   That's right.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   And as a sitting senator.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   Yes.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Right.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Yes, that's right.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   Because I think you should have your own opinion.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   I'm...
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   Pretty straightforward.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   And so...
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   How does that...
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.680]   How does that phone call go?
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.720]   Do you call Chuck and say, "I have something to tell you," or actually, more importantly,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.320]   joking aside, how did that evolution happen for you?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Ah.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   So, you started out...
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   You're in Arizona.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   You start out as a clear Democrat.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   That wins you the...
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   Actually...
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.740]   So, "Turn Back Time," great song.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.040]   When I first ran for office, very young, like in my 20s, I ran as an independent.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   Right.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   And then I ran dead last.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.720]   And then I re-registered as a Democrat, ran for the same office, came in first.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.880]   And then you fast forward...
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   Changed nothing.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   It...
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   Meaning, in terms of what you said?
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   My hair changes all the time.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.400]   But apart from that, nothing changed.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Nothing changed.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   Right?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   Right.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   So, re-registered as a Democrat, came in first.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.700]   Served in the state house for six years, served in the state senate for a term, ran
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.680]   for the US Congress, won a competitive district, slightly more Republican than Democrat.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   I won.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.080]   I served in that seat for six years, ran for the Senate, became the first woman ever to
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   win a Senate race in Arizona.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.000]   More importantly, I was the first member of, at the time, the Democratic Party in over
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.080]   30 years to win a Senate seat in Arizona.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.800]   But I was never a traditional Democrat.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.640]   And those who've known me for a long time have always known that, that I just am not
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.480]   interested in fitting into a box and never have been.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.840]   And so, I've always been me.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.440]   There came a point where me being me no longer fit within the Democratic Party.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.680]   And they were really uncomfortable having me in the party.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.140]   And so, I made it easier for them by leaving.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.760]   And it made everyone happier.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.840]   I was a lot happier because I was being more genuine.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.640]   But what does that mean?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.200]   Can you just double-click into you being you?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.280]   What is it that made them so uncomfortable?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.160]   My first vote in the United States Senate was a vote on the issue of Israel.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.200]   And I got a call from, at the time, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.040]   And he asked me to vote no on the measure.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.520]   And I said, "Well, there's zero chance I'm voting no on this measure.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.480]   This is a vote to stand with Israel.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   The chance I vote no is a hard zero."
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   He was like, "Ah, this is partisan, and we got to be a unity."
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.480]   And I'm not going to share the details of that conversation, but it was a partisan conversation.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.800]   And for me, I was like, "I'm confused about the nature of this conversation because the
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.400]   idea that I'm going to change my vote because someone else wants me to is never going to
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   happen."
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   Right.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.080]   The only thing that would cause me to change my vote is to get new information that changes
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.680]   the calculus for my decision.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   Right?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   The only sign of growth and learning is if you get new information, right?
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.520]   There was no new information.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.960]   It was just a party vote.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.840]   And I said, "Yeah, well, I don't need to go to the party.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   Like, I'm going to vote the way that I believe."
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   And for me, that didn't seem like a particularly important moment.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's just how I am.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.560]   But that was problematic for other people.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.920]   Is there a lot of pressure in the way that politics happens on the ground, which is a
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.240]   lot of you in the Senate may come to a conclusion or an opinion, but before that vote is cast,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   there's just...
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   On both sides.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.440]   Tremendous pressure to reassign whatever you underwrote.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   It almost...
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   Hey, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   Now, we got to toe the party line.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Is there a lot of that?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   Yes.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   I mean, the biggest example of that would be what I think is the most important vote
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.820]   I've ever taken in my entire life.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.620]   And that was the vote to protect the filibuster.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.240]   The pressure around that vote was severe.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   Let me want to explain that to folks just...
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.240]   So the filibuster is a provision in the United States Senate.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   It's a rule.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.480]   It's not constitutional, but it's a rule that requires that any major piece of legislation,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.000]   any policy-related legislation requires the approval of 60 senators rather than 51, so
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.400]   a super majority, in order to move forward to debate, discuss, and pass the piece of
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   legislation.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   Now, there's some people who hate the filibuster because they like to have all the power when
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.000]   they have the power, and I think it's very dangerous to eliminate the filibuster.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.160]   The filibuster is like a control mechanism that keeps the Senate from ricocheting back
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   and forth between the wild edges of the political pressure from either party.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.720]   Now, some people will say, "Well, the filibuster's new.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   It wasn't always around."
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.320]   Well, that's true, because when the Senate was founded, it took 100 senators to move
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.680]   forward on a piece of legislation, right?
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   100.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   And it's eroded down to 60.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.840]   I believe it would be very dangerous to eliminate that and allow it to be a simple majority.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.720]   The Senate would become the House, and for God's sake, I served there for six years.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.340]   There's a reason I went to the Senate, right?
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.000]   The idea is that the Senate is a place that represents all of the views of the country,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   including areas that are rural or small or had been left behind.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.680]   Minority opinions must be protected and celebrated in the United States Senate.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.440]   But there was intense pressure, intense pressure, to eliminate the filibuster.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.000]   Now, the thing that's interesting is that pressure had zero impact on me, like zero,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   none.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.280]   And people thought it was going to.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.520]   They were like, "Oh, we're going to get her.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   We're going to get her."
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.320]   And I just was like, "Sure, I'll go to every meeting you'd like."
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.640]   I went to every single meeting.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.760]   I listened to everyone.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.800]   No one ever gave me any information that led me to think it would be a good idea to get
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.320]   rid of the last vestige of bipartisanship in the United States Senate.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.040]   Is there a...
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.640]   Knowing what you know now, is there a path out of this?
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.280]   And how much more toxic has it gotten over the years?
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   And why?
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   And why?
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   We didn't get to the why.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.880]   What's driven the extreme partisanship, the inability to have dialogue, the lack of the
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   idea, the cauldron?
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.680]   Well, it has gotten a lot worse.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.920]   I've been doing this for 20 years and obviously started in elementary school, but I've been
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.680]   doing it for a long time and it has gotten much more severe, much more partisan.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.140]   There are a number of factors for that.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:27.380]   But I think a large part of it is that we as Americans, we, all of us, are choosing
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:32.840]   people who agree with us 100% of the time because it feels good.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.420]   Even if those individuals don't get shit done, they don't return any results, but they will
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.160]   make a TikTok telling you how your view is so right.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.080]   And it's now become out of favor to support someone with whom you agree with only 60%
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080]   of the time.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.280]   When the reality is, is that if you find someone with whom you agree with only 60% of the time,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.520]   they're thinking for themselves and so are you.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.480]   But if you find someone with whom you agree with 100% of the time, either they're lying
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.880]   to you or you're not thinking for yourself.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.480]   And those are two very dangerous things, both very dangerous.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.760]   So it has gotten more and more extreme because our political system rewards those who say
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.560]   the things that are not true in order to get the applause and the likes and the support,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   money, et cetera, and punish those who say the things that are true but are not everything
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   you want.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   You know?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.600]   Does that mean that democracy eventually dies?
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   No, I don't think so.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.160]   Our country has been through much worse.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.960]   I mean, we had a civil war.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.480]   I do think it gets worse for a while before it gets better, you know?
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.360]   And to Jason's question, how does it get better?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.480]   Well, I think it gets really bad.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.600]   And then when it gets pretty bad, people are like, "Oh, shit, we've got to do something.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.200]   Like, this is our only country."
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.040]   And then, you know, it kind of comes back.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   Is that this moment now?
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.280]   No, I don't think we're there yet.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.440]   What play out the scenarios here, Kamala wins, Trump wins, we spend another eight trillion
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.280]   in debt and how many more cycles can we do that?
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   Neither party cares about debt.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   Tell me about it.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   Let's be honest about that.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   Well, but-
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   Big spenders on both sides.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.160]   Which means it's going to happen.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.120]   So we're sitting here maybe two more cycles from now and we've put another 15 trillion
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.360]   down, you know, on this.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.560]   And then when does it break?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.000]   What is the impetus to make that change?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   When does it break down?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   When do we hit rock bottom?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   What concerns you?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'm not sure I know the answer to that.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.520]   And anyone who tells you they do is probably lying.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.080]   But what are the possibilities that you see from inside the machine of this really breaking?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   There are some challenges ahead, right?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.320]   I mean, Congress spends like a drunken sailor with no thought for the future.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.080]   We are running to the tape on being able to fund things like social security and Medicare.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.120]   And Congress is doing nothing to solve it, right?
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.000]   There's actually a little coalition of us who are trying to solve those problems.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.760]   Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, Senator King, myself.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.960]   And when we went to go talk to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, they were like,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   "No, let's wait till after the election."
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.840]   Yeah, that's totally going to make it better, right?
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   Things are going to be totally good after the election.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:08.000]   They're just putting off that which is uncomfortable because the solution to those fiscal problems
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.600]   require sacrifice in the short term.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.260]   And elected officials are not willing to sacrifice anything in the short term because it means
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260]   that they may not get reelected.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.520]   And if their number one goal is to survive, then they're not going to make the hard decisions.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.960]   Can we talk about that for a second?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.480]   Can you just explain to us the underbelly of politics, the money in politics, the people
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.560]   that you have to spend time with, how the money cycle works, how did you feel that pressure,
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   if at all?
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   Even if...
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.520]   I'm not saying you responded to it, but maybe just to explain to it.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.480]   Well, it does take millions and millions and millions of dollars to run for office.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.400]   I mean, a Senate seat in Arizona is like, what, $150 million?
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.040]   So you do need a lot of help.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.240]   Sorry, to win a Senate seat, it's $150 million in Arizona.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.640]   Yeah, in Arizona.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.240]   But there are some states in which it probably costs way less because it's not competitive.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   But in a competitive state, it's going to be very, very expensive.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.160]   But look, there is always pressure to raise the money, but you can go about it however
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   you want to go about it.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.520]   Most people go about it the easy way, which is to just kind of follow the line that the
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.740]   party is given, and then the machine lines it up to give you the money.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:20.320]   If you choose not to follow the line, which is the path that I took, then you have to
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.640]   find folks who are also unusual and don't fit easily into a party line to help and support
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   you.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   But that's a very important thing you're saying.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.400]   So essentially is, if you conform, which means that in those times where you get the phone
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   call, you have to basically toe the line, otherwise the money spigot stops.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   Is that right?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   Or no, is it not that drastic?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.440]   I mean, it was that drastic for me.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.200]   After the filibuster vote, everyone was like, we hate you, clunk.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.120]   And I was like, right, but I am protecting democracy, so call me back later, click.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.040]   They have not called back.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.600]   That day's coming, guys.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.040]   So the way you're framing it, though, I think is maybe not exactly correct, because what
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.920]   you're saying is you have to do the party line thing in order to stay in.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720]   The thing that I think it's important to remember is most people want to do the party line thing.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.400]   It's not like they're sitting around going like, oh, I really don't want to vote this
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.160]   way, but I really feel like I have to, to save my career.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.020]   There's this thing about being part of the club.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.000]   People want to be part of the club, and so it's not like the thumb is being pushed down
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.400]   on lots of people to get them to do a certain thing.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.760]   They're doing it because they're part of the club.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   Right.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   It makes sense.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   I don't understand that.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   Me either, obviously.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.320]   But I get it.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.080]   So, first of all, I want to say that I wholeheartedly agree with you about the need to have a free
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   marketplace of ideas where people can debate these issues without any fear of reprisal.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.200]   And I think it's sentiments like that that made me support you as when you were a senator
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   and a Democrat.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.400]   People may be surprised to find out that actually we co-hosted an event with you a few years
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.700]   ago because I look for opportunities to support Democrats when I can when they're independent
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   minded.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700]   And look, I wrote that one for you, David.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   I've always appreciated that.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.920]   I've always appreciated that about you.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   So thank you for that.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   We had breakfast.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   We had breakfast.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.640]   We went back to the first year of the Biden administration, 2021.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.600]   And I don't know if people remember, but that whole year, domestic politics was roiled by
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.360]   a piece of legislation called Build Back Better.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.440]   This is a four and a half trillion dollar spending package.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   Actually, originally it was six, remember?
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   Six.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   Six trillion.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Six trillion.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   Which is like, woohoo!
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   That's like bonkers.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   Yeah, they brought it down to four and a half trillion.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   What's the difference?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Four, six?
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   Whatever.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   Whatever.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.680]   And it eventually failed because every Republican voted against it, and two Democrats, you and
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:54.640]   Senator Manchin, voted against it, as I recall.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.760]   The thing that always seemed really crazy to me is, beyond just the sheer amount of
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.400]   the spending package, which now everyone looks at the deficit and the debt, and they're like,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.280]   it's already crazy enough as it is without that having passed.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   Imagine if it did pass.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   Our economy.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   Can you imagine?
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   It would have been a total disaster, I think.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.560]   But the amazing thing to me was that we had this yearlong debate in Washington, and they
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.880]   never just came to you and Manchin at the beginning of the process and just said, "What
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   are you guys willing to do?"
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.480]   Because you were the swing votes, right?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.160]   And instead, they spent a year pushing for this thing, and then I guess they expected
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.680]   to kind of jam it through at the end, put enough pressure on you to vote for this.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.560]   I actually had this discussion with Schumer in the White House in the summer of '21.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.920]   So I'm sure all of you remember all of this, because this is what you do in your lives,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.520]   is think about the work that I'm doing in the United States Senate.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:59.840]   But in February of 2021, after we passed a big COVID package, which we passed a pretty
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.840]   sizable COVID package, I was worried that it wasn't paid for.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.000]   I was worried about the impact this would have on the economy.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.720]   Turns out all that was right.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.640]   I went to Schumer the day after that and said, "Look, I know that you want to do infrastructure
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.080]   next, and I want to do infrastructure, because infrastructure is really important for the
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.720]   future of economic growth and competitiveness in our country.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.960]   But I want to do it in a bipartisan way, because that's what we should be doing in the Senate."
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.160]   And he said something to me along the lines of, "We'd love to have the Republicans with
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   us.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   If they'd like to come, that'd be great."
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   And I was like, "Well, so my idea of bipartisanship is a little bit different.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.480]   It's more about the sit down and work together and create something together, and then have
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.600]   a product that you put up together, rather than just building it and asking someone to
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.360]   come and jump on your train."
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.760]   And so people just kind of patted me on the head.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.240]   And I went out and started working with Rob Portman, who has since retired, but let me
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.840]   tell you what, super smart, very nerdy, great with a spreadsheet.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.040]   I was like, "That's my guy right there."
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.600]   And so Rob and I began working quietly, just the two of us, doing nuts and bolts of how
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.520]   to build an infrastructure plan.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.800]   After we gained some steam, we began inviting others.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.240]   So it ended up that we had a really carefully curated group of five Dems and five Republicans,
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.400]   all moderates and conservatives, working on infrastructure.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.000]   And we got to a place where our infrastructure bill was going to go.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.580]   You all may recall, we actually got it done, and it was paid for.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:30.000]   But while we were almost at the point of voting on the infrastructure package, that's when
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.760]   the White House unveiled Build Back Better.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.200]   And I actually put out a public statement, which is very rare for me, saying, "There's
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   no way I'm going to vote for that package, because it cost $8 bazillion, and it was irresponsible."
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.080]   And, oh, they were so pissed off.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.360]   They were like, "Why did you say that?"
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.000]   I'm like, "Well, I think it's important for everyone to know that there's zero chance
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I vote for that.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.520]   And I want to say it now so that I don't get jammed later, right?
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.080]   Because I would rather disappoint people today rather than disappoint them the day of the
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   vote.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.400]   I want them to know I will never vote for this."
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.640]   And the pressure just grew from there.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.440]   Didn't work, obviously, because there was zero chance in which I was going to vote for
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.680]   $4.5 trillion of new taxes, many of which are being debated right now in the presidential
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.040]   campaign and which are bonkers.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.200]   And so I just, I said no.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.000]   I said no early on.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.100]   So I did start engaging with the White House after that.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.240]   And they said, "Well, what would you vote for?"
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.920]   And I said, "Here."
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.120]   And I created a spreadsheet.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.920]   And I said, "Here are all the tax policies that you're interested in.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.720]   Here are the ones that I'm willing to consider."
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.880]   It was a small list.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.160]   And they just didn't believe me for a long time.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.160]   It took a year.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.820]   No, it took about 14 months.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.600]   Fourteen months later, they believed me when I said, "Here are the policies I will support.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.860]   Here are the ones I will not support."
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.560]   But it took 14 months before people believed that I meant what I said about tax policy.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   When J.D. was up here, and thank you for that work, by the way, and that independence.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.000]   It just strikes me before you move on, Jason, that we could have avoided so much rancor
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.920]   over the first one to two years of the Biden administration if they'd just listened to
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   you.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   Except in reality.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920]   Because you were trying to find-
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   That's what I said.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   You were trying to find...
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920]   It was close to a 50/50 Senate.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   Or I guess it was a 50/50.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   It was 50/50.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   It was 50/50.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   It was 50/50.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   Right.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.000]   So it's not like President Biden had an LBJ-like mandate to push through massive new tax-spending
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   programs.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.080]   I did point that out a few times.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.000]   So in any event, it's always seemed crazy to me that they didn't listen to you, and
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   they didn't try and find that bipartisan compromise very early on.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.000]   We could have avoided so much of this, again, the rancor.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.680]   But here's the thing, David, and then I want to get to your point, but look, both parties
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   do this.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.960]   So I don't want it to sound like I'm just shitting all over Biden and Schumer.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.920]   Because look, when Trump was president and he controlled all the chambers, he did the
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   same thing.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.300]   So there's no purity here, right?
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.660]   When one party has total control, they overuse it.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.040]   That is what happens.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.020]   Because when a party gets power, they think they're going to have it forever, they overreach,
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.340]   and then the system corrects.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.300]   And so one might suggest, just maybe suggest, that a small amount of humility would help
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   here.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.620]   To think that perhaps when you do have power, you may not always have power, and that it
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.460]   would be good and it would serve you well to always consider other people's positions,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.580]   other party positions, even if they're not the same as your own, because there will come
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.360]   a time when those individuals have the power.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.060]   And that perhaps if you're interested in having some stability and predictability in our country,
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.700]   that finding that more moderate ground is always good, regardless of which party is
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.700]   in power.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.700]   That's very unpopular what I just said.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:49.180]   I'm curious, when we look at this two-party system, if there is a way out of it and to
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:55.500]   maybe create a little bit more choice for, and a little bit more competition, and have
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   a viable third party.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:05.940]   Sachs, you explained in the last panel how Kennedy to Trump and Cheney to Kamala.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.740]   It's very strange times we're living in, and most of us don't feel that either party represents
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.740]   us fully.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.280]   Sachs doesn't believe with these neocons, starting wars everywhere, et cetera.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.960]   So is it possible for us to have a viable third party, because you seem to be also party-less?
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.240]   Which I'm fine with.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.620]   Party of one is great, guys.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   I love it.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.620]   Party of one, sit at the bar.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.620]   It's perfect.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.620]   Yes, I love it.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.620]   It's great.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   Yeah, me too.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.940]   The nice thing about being a party of one is you get to have the entire platform to
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.940]   yourself.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.480]   If people are like, "What's your party platform?"
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.440]   Well, I made it up because it's all my ideas.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   It's wonderful.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   Yes.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.200]   So there was an attempt this year to try and create a third party option.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.720]   The group No Labels, with whom I have a great relationship with and a lot of respect for,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.080]   worked on it.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.640]   The time is not ripe for that.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   That was obvious.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.260]   Why is the time not ripe?
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.040]   I don't know that I can answer that for you.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.480]   My assessment is that many people in America are so scared of what the other party represents
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   and the potential overreach that comes from the other party's positions, and the story
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.760]   that has been created, that the existence of the other party is an existential threat
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.640]   to the future of our country.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   That's a story that both parties tell.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:23.200]   I think because of that, most Americans, they're dissatisfied with the parties, but they don't
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.080]   feel confident or comfortable enough to go somewhere else because they're not sure what
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.320]   it will bring.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.760]   The fear of the other is at an all-time high.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.280]   I'm curious in this audience, putting this election cycle aside, how many people would
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.480]   like to see us have a third or fourth option, a third or fourth party?
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   Raise your hand.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   Okay.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   That's like everybody in the audience.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   I don't...
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   I mean, this is a unique audience.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   A lot of parties have won.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   What's that?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   A lot of parties have won.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   I mean...
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   I think more Americans...
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   Ross Perot got 19%.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   It looked like Bobby Kennedy had, at the peak, what, 15, 20%?
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   Peak to 18?
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   Peak to 18?
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   I mean, it does seem like...
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.560]   And people really wanted No Labels to put up Manchin, maybe yourself or somebody.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   No, no, no.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   I'm overqualified.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   Okay.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   That's...
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   Well, what's...
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   Would you...
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   Would you...
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   What's next for you?
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.920]   Are you going to consider running, or you want to be in the private sector, or you just
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   want to party on it?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   I'm really excited about what's happening in the private sector right now.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.160]   I mean, we've got industries in this country that are really pushing the edge on what's
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.840]   going to ensure that we're globally competitive and innovative for the future.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.120]   And I'm really excited about it.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.560]   And I believe that, regardless of what's happening in government, because, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.920]   I do think it's going to get worse.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.240]   Gridlock's going to get tougher, and blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.880]   People are not interested in solving problems.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.920]   They're just interested in tick-tock.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:45.040]   And so, there's a real opportunity to move our country forward, despite the gridlock
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.440]   in government, through private industry.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.320]   And that's where I want to work.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.640]   Why are the Democrats so anti-capitalist?
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.960]   I don't understand, because that's where the money comes from.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.920]   Yeah, I just don't understand Ms. Bent of being so...
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   I don't either.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   I do not either.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:10.560]   And I'm fairly libertarian, I think, just at my base, most Arizonans are.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.080]   I struggle with the idea of wanting to eliminate the private industry, because that is where
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.360]   the ideas come from, that's where the innovation comes from, and that's where the money comes
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.800]   from to fund the social programs that are important to protect the vulnerable in our
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   country.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   That's what the United States was built on.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.200]   That's what the United States was built on, 250 years ago, and the ability to innovate,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.640]   the opportunity for entrepreneurs to build, and for people to partake in that created
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.000]   productivity gains and ultimately prosperity for everyone, and it makes no sense to stall
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   it.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   It just doesn't make any sense.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I don't understand it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   Do you, when you look at the Israel-Palestine conflict, has any of this, is this expected,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.280]   the way that there's this fissure that's built in America now, the fissure that's been created
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   in Western Europe?
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   It's been growing.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   It's been growing.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.440]   You know, I'm quite close with the pro-Israel community, not just in Arizona, but nationally,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.560]   because Israel is our only democratic partner in the Middle East, and is one of the best
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:12.960]   partners to the United States, and has been since its inception.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.340]   But anti-Semitism has long been a part of our country's history, and it has been growing.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.160]   The difference is, is that it was kind of quietish, you know, it was happening on campuses
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   with the anti-BDS movement.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.480]   It was growing in a number of circles on both the far left and the far right.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   And what we've seen, you know, in the last year, is that it's now okay to say the quiet
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.360]   part out loud.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.880]   What's boggling to my mind, and I don't talk about this very often because it makes me
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.180]   sound really nerdy, but I actually have studied genocide.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.440]   Like I did a PhD on the Rwandan genocide, right?
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:57.800]   Which is super nerdy, I know, but the narrative that somehow Israel are the oppressors, and
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:04.080]   Hamas are the liberators, and then there are folks who are actually using the term genocide
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.640]   to talk about the Israeli government and the Israeli people is so insane.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.720]   Like, that's insane.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:20.040]   I mean, talk about the worst form of gaslighting you can even imagine, right?
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.940]   Like, it's just insane.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.880]   And yet, it's not a surprise because if you've been paying attention, it's been percolating
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.120]   and growing for years.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.720]   And folks in the pro-Israel community know this, and they've been talking about it.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.160]   It's just that no one was really listening because it was all whisper, whisper, whisper,
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.400]   or just, you know, kids on campuses.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   But now, what we see happening, especially at these so-called elite universities where
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:49.560]   not only has the pro-Hamas movement taken over, but the faculty, the folks who are responsible
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   for the educational environment, have shown an unwillingness to speak the truth, which
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.200]   I think is just incredibly disturbing.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:06.840]   Is there a path to find an empathetic solution for the Palestinians while also at the same
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.040]   time eliminating Hamas and just getting past this problem?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.320]   The vast majority of Palestinian people are living in an environment in which they don't
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.640]   have control over their daily lives.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.280]   They don't get access to the food and the water they need.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.540]   They're being used as human shields and political weapons and physical weapons by Hamas.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.280]   And so, they are in just a horrible, horrible situation.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.720]   And so, the work that we've been trying to do to navigate how to get relief or evacuation
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.400]   for those individuals is really important and should not be eliminated or cut off.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.280]   We also need to be much, much more careful about who we're giving the money and the food
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.760]   and the supplies to, because we know that the majority of it is being siphoned off by
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.640]   Hamas and used as a weapon of war.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.360]   Is there a solution that can protect the innocent lives?
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.760]   Absolutely.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.440]   Is standing with Hamas that solution?
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   No.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.400]   That's like doing a rally for ISIS.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   What the hell?
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.920]   Al-Qaeda's like, "How did we not see this?"
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   Al-Qaeda's like, "We could have just gone to Harvard."
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   How are young people at Harvard and Columbia and Yale, how come they don't, all of a sudden
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.720]   that distinction isn't obvious to them?
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.240]   It is hard for me to understand this.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.700]   Now, I am lucky enough to live in Arizona, and we just don't have this.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.160]   There's a very small amount of this, very small, on our campuses.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.720]   But the vast majority of students in Arizona, these are like regular kids.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.280]   These are not fancy kids.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   These are regular kids.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.920]   They go to regular schools, they live a regular life, and they go to a regular state school.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.200]   And so they don't wake up in the morning and think, "I think I want to support those terrorists
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.080]   over there in the Middle East."
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.840]   And so I think there's one of the problems that I see in academia, and full disclosure,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.040]   I have been a professor at Arizona State University for 21 years.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.160]   So I teach.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.320]   I teach this semester.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.640]   I've been teaching nonstop for 21 years.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:03.760]   But I teach in a climate where my students are expected to be triggered or whatever that
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   word is.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   I think that's a stupid word.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.160]   But the bottom line is this.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.040]   There's this whole thing moving across the country where we're like, "Oh, we can't have
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   any triggering conversations.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.440]   We can't have conversations that make you uncomfortable."
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.040]   That is the whole purpose of college.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.840]   The whole idea of the university is to go learn about the universe.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.340]   You should be confronted with ideas that are different than your own.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.920]   You should interact with people who have views that are different than your own.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.400]   You should be open to learning and listening and changing and growing.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.960]   That is the reason that you go to university.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   And that is being taken away.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:37.200]   Senator Sinema, thank you for being with us.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.440]   (applause)
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.680]   (applause)
