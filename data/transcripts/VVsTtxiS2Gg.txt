[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Do you have a process for making big decisions in life or work?
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.880]   Well, there are decisions made under uncertainty and decisions made under
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200]   certainty. So under certainty means you have a lot of data.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.320]   Those are the easiest decisions and they actually are the least impactful
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.600]   because anybody can make those decisions.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   The hardest decisions and the most impactful ones are the ones made under
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.840]   uncertainty. So that comes down to judgment. Well,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   judgment to me is decision-making under uncertainty,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.760]   which means there's a bunch of luck involved,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.160]   but some people show evidence of having better judgment than others.
