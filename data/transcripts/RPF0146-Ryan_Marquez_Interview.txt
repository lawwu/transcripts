[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.860]   One of the blind spots that I have
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.020]   is having never worked as an accountant,
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.940]   having never acquired a CPA license,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.760]   having never consulted with clients

[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.280]   It's really tough.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.000]   As a practitioner and a former,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.400]   and a financial planner,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.560]   I think anybody who has a little bit of experience
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.000]   in any technical aspect of planning,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.400]   you have to get very comfortable quickly
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.820]   with the idea of being wrong
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.680]   because sometimes you just get stuff wrong.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.040]   And so I love having knowledgeable accountants like you
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.760]   and other, there are financial planners that listen
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.120]   that email me from time to time.

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   I wanted to bring some information on accounting
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.560]   and bookkeeping to the audience,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   but I knew that that's not necessarily my area of expertise.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.120]   And so I'm thrilled to have you here.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.480]   What I'd love to start with is,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.140]   share with us a little bit about your story
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.680]   and a little bit about your background
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.120]   in the accounting field.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   So people, listeners can have some confidence
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.940]   in our course of discussion today.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.860]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.120]   So I'm originally from Southern California.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.620]   I was born and raised there in Orange County.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.280]   After I graduated with my undergraduate degree
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.020]   from a small school down there, I relocated to Idaho.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.280]   And I've heard you talk in probably quite a few shows
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.380]   about relocating for a lower cost of living or lower taxes.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.480]   And those are some of the exact reasons
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.760]   that I decided to move to Boise, Idaho.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600]   I've noticed my quality of life is a lot higher here
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.200]   and I'm able to do some things here
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.080]   that I wouldn't be able to do in California.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.720]   So we were just talking before the show,
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.440]   I ride my bike to work.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.840]   You can do that in bigger metropolitan areas
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.120]   but it's a little harder.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.000]   The area that you need to live in is limited
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and a lot of times more expensive if you're working downtown.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And so that's about my relocation to Idaho.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.840]   When I came to Boise, I decided to go to Boise State
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.480]   to get my master's in tax.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.820]   And then that was just a one-year program,
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   really intense program with just a bunch of tax classes.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.200]   And then after I graduated,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.280]   I went into public accounting at a large firm.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.760]   I work with small to medium-sized,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.720]   closely held businesses and their owners.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.280]   And so I got a good idea of, okay,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.960]   what's happening at the entity level for these people
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.040]   and then how I see that move to their individual tax returns.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   I also see kind of what mid to high wealthy individuals
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.820]   are doing with their money, with what they're interested in
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.460]   with respect to tax planning.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.380]   Are they really interested in $5,500 for their IRA each year?
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.020]   Some are, some aren't.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.900]   And so it's an interesting perspective
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.720]   to kind of work with a lot of different people around town
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.300]   but at the same time, be able to still relate to them
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   as opposed to working either with or at a large corporation
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.820]   in their accounting department.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.220]   It's a different skill set
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.620]   and it's a different mind frame you really have to have.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.380]   We have some clients that if something's off,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.380]   I don't know, five, six, $7 million, they could care less.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.660]   But the people I work with, really,
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.060]   a lot of them care about every single cent.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.320]   So it's interesting from that perspective.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.540]   - I've often thought that would be much more interesting
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.980]   working as an accountant
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.180]   to have that type of varied practice.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.620]   I've had a few friends that I've known
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.100]   that work in some large firms here where I live in Florida.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.900]   And it just seems like, I mean, if you're an auditor
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   and all you do all day is audit large corporations,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.380]   that just seems, I don't know,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.620]   maybe it's a personality type that doesn't appeal to me
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.200]   but the opportunity to work with different people
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.500]   at different levels to me would seem like a really appealing
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.420]   I guess job profile.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.900]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.660]   And I enjoy, a lot of my job is,
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.740]   depending on how much one would know
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.060]   about the accounting field,
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.820]   a lot of my job is actually talking and meeting
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.300]   and discussing kind of face-to-face
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.820]   either over the phone with these individuals
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.020]   as opposed to just going through numbers all day.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.180]   And so I get a kick out of that.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.020]   I think it's funny you mentioned the auditors.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.300]   I was laughing the other day on the 529 show.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.060]   You got the two emails from the auditors
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.340]   that wanna switch fields.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.820]   And I just kinda chuckled 'cause I was like,
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.300]   yep, I would too if I was an auditor.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.820]   And I'm a tax guy so I can kinda,
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.020]   I can jab at the auditors just a little bit.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.020]   - I wanna ask you a question
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.060]   about the master's in tax curriculum
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.380]   'cause I know that you have a master's in taxation
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.540]   and you teach in the master's of tax program.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.300]   I've thought about setting that out
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.660]   as a course of study for myself.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.420]   I've pretty much decided I don't really have any use
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.140]   for the academic credential at this point.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.460]   Although if I could find a cheap enough program
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.540]   that I could do self-study, who knows,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.420]   I might do it just to,
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.060]   'cause the credential can be useful in the academic,
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.220]   I mean, in the community that I work in.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.300]   But I've mainly just been interested in the knowledge
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.380]   and I've realized that I have a hole
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.820]   in my personal understanding of finance
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.900]   with regard to some of the theoretical side of taxation.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.740]   I've looked at syllabus,
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.380]   syllabi for international tax policy,
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.700]   just different aspects of that.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.340]   I've wondered, generally our master's of tax programs,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.260]   are they focused on the practitioner,
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.020]   the ins and outs of the knowledge
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.660]   that a financial planner or an accountant might need
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.380]   to accurately apply this credit, this program,
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.060]   or are they primarily focused on the theory side?
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.420]   Here's the history of taxation,
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.460]   here's the theoretical framework
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.420]   that is applied as governmental policy.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.860]   What is your opinion on that?
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.620]   - So it's interesting you ask the question
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.060]   'cause that's the program at BSU
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.580]   I'm actively trying to work with to make better.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.460]   After I graduated and I came into public accounting,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.420]   I felt a lot of the stuff I was actually doing,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.940]   I never really learned in the program.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.540]   To directly answer your question,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.540]   a lot of it hinges on the history piece
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.580]   and then it gets into really academic accounting
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.100]   and tax knowledge.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.300]   And so depending on the type of teacher you have,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.180]   they'll either put it in context for you or not.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.060]   But a lot of it is very standard,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.980]   I think, lifecycle transactions of either a partnership
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.420]   or an S-corp or a corporation.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.060]   But you really miss out on the,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.380]   okay, here's this form, how do you fill it out?
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.220]   Or the tax planning aspects of,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.940]   okay, here's this situation
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.380]   and what would you do with this client
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.740]   and what would you recommend?
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.300]   And part of the problem is there's not enough time
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.100]   in the semester to really,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.340]   okay, get through all the basics
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.500]   of here's what you need to know
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.780]   and then dive into the tax planning
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.140]   and other things like that.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.620]   And so one of the reasons Boise State actually welcomed me
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.460]   and picked me up as a professor there
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.580]   is the classes I do teach are really practical
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.940]   and they don't have it in their program
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.300]   or even mention it in any of their classes.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.460]   And I know with talking to other students
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.700]   and looking at other schools,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.220]   they have bits and variations of them.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.540]   And a lot of the larger schools will have these classes,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.500]   but at least here from Boise State, they didn't.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.540]   And so my classes are really practical knowledge
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.860]   that you're gonna use every day,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.940]   at least on the tech side of public accounting.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.540]   And I'm hoping my one goal for any class I teach is,
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.260]   okay, I hope to give all of my students
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.020]   just a little bit of a leg up with all of their peers
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.160]   when going into public accounting.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.660]   'Cause a lot of it is you spend your first year learning,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.740]   maybe even your second year
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.500]   just learning, learning, learning.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.700]   But if I can cut that down for my students
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.700]   with practical knowledge that they're gonna use every day,
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.580]   I think that's a win for my classes.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.580]   - Awesome.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.440]   So let's dig into the meat of our content
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.300]   as far as the subject that we're gonna be working on today.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.420]   And that's an introduction to bookkeeping
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.540]   as for business owners especially and some best practices.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.360]   This is probably one of the areas that is,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.300]   it's overwhelming to many people who are new in business.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.540]   I remember it was to me as a new financial advisor,
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.580]   I was, it's a business.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.340]   And here I was responsible for tracking everything
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.060]   and figuring out what can I do, what can I not do.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.660]   And my systems were terrible for the first couple of years.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.180]   And looking back, I never did go through
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.740]   and file amended returns.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.140]   But now when I look back at what an idiot I was,
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.180]   and I thought about it, I went through and I looked at it,
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.820]   but it was okay.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.580]   But when I go back through and look at all of the stuff
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.500]   that I missed due to poor bookkeeping
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.200]   that would have been in my favor
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.740]   and not in the IRS's favor for my first few years,
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.660]   it really made me hurt.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.620]   And I tell you, even this is something
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.420]   that financial planners struggle with.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.780]   Most business people, unless they're established,
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.980]   this is a major question of how do I set this up.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.100]   And from what I do, talking about,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.660]   from what I do as far as teaching,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.720]   here's how to integrate all of this knowledge.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.820]   You need records and that starts with bookkeeping.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.500]   And as individuals, as businesses,
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.580]   we really struggle with this.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.640]   So let's kick it off with how would you approach me
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.140]   as a new business owner,
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.760]   giving me some practical instruction and ideas
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.860]   on how to establish the bookkeeping side of my business?
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.900]   - Yeah, so I kind of put together an outline here
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.420]   of my tips and I have them in five overall categories.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.800]   I tried to make it a little easier to follow
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.920]   and categorize these tips.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.060]   And I should say up front,
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.720]   this isn't an exhaustive list of everything you need to do
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.740]   or step-by-step detail instructions,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.700]   but they're just some basic tips I've seen help
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.720]   a lot of people and basically like the question you asked,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.680]   how I would approach proposing to someone
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.080]   how they set things up from the get-go
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.320]   so that all their records and documentation are in place
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.920]   so that when you get to tax return time,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.320]   you're not missing deductions
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.780]   like you maybe did in your first few years.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   And so the first category I have here
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   is I just wanted to talk briefly about overall theme.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.100]   And the first point here is to change your mindset
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.720]   on bookkeeping and accounting.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.740]   I see a lot of entrepreneurs
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.360]   that don't necessarily think about it up front
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.860]   and they don't want to because they are,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.980]   or they want to be working on their business.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.520]   Like I started a consulting practice
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.080]   to consult people on marketing
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.720]   or I started a podcast to be a podcaster
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.800]   and record these shows.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.120]   I didn't do that to all of a sudden
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.700]   have a bunch of accounting and bookkeeping
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.860]   and tracking numbers.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.400]   But you really do need to change your mindset on it
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.080]   'cause it is important.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   It's important to understand where your business is currently
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.940]   where it came from, from a financial standpoint,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.040]   and where it could possibly be going
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.100]   or what resources you currently have
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.560]   in your bank account or what assets you have.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:57.720]   And so if anyone's taken a intro to accounting class
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.400]   or accounting 101, something like that,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.480]   you'll hear every professor talk about
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.080]   accounting as the language of business
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.500]   and they make this big deal about it
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.800]   and how lavish it is.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.300]   But to be honest, it really is true.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.220]   And if people don't necessarily understand
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.560]   what I mean by accounting as the language of business,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.520]   what that means is essentially you need records.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's a process of records that essentially
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.700]   organizes the financial information
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.720]   into an easily accessible format
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.060]   so that someone can understand
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.920]   what's going on with your business,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.880]   whether they're in marketing or whether they're in research
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   or whether they're at the bank or even investors.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.720]   But if you don't necessarily understand the language,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.320]   it's hard to talk with different entrepreneurs
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.080]   or even talk with yourself really about your business.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.680]   - I think you could expand on that
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   and even just simply say,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.020]   I don't know if this is true or not,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.280]   but what comes to mind as I think about that
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.520]   saying from accounting is,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.520]   economics is the language of life.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.680]   And the accounting, the specific numerical accounting
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.640]   is indeed the language of business.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   But our lives are governed by economic decisions
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.480]   at every stage of life.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.760]   And what happens is in general,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.060]   many people view finance as something that's boring,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.860]   that's dry, that's difficult, that's overwhelming.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.000]   But it affects every single life and every single lifestyle.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.500]   No matter how creative and right-brained the venture,
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.440]   it's still an economic transaction.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.380]   And once you understand the fundamental economics
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.720]   and economic decisions,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.200]   especially the numbers and the accounting system behind it,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.180]   you can immediately know what the outcome
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.560]   of a course of action is going to be.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.360]   And so I think it's, frankly, it's criminal
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.740]   that we don't equip people
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.960]   with at least a basic knowledge of understanding
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.740]   to not feel intimidated by the books and the numbers.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.240]   So, and with a basic knowledge,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.760]   it can free somebody up to really focus
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.800]   on what they really wanna do.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.160]   The creative aspect, the specific business enterprise,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.480]   or whatever it is that they wanna do.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.740]   If you've got the foundation behind you,
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.520]   you're actually more free
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.620]   than if you just shut yourself down to it and say,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.720]   "Well, I just don't wanna deal with that."
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.140]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.420]   And a lot of the, I'll get to it a little later,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.040]   but one of the overarching themes of what I do
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.240]   with bookkeeping and what I recommend to people is simple
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.160]   and easy to do so that the process actually gets done
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.960]   and you have more time that's free
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.560]   to go do whatever you need to do on your business.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.200]   And it's interesting, I guess,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.440]   two comments I had on what you just said
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.920]   is I have a lot of people,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.960]   or I was talking with a guy earlier in the year
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.600]   where he was losing money,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   but he thought he was making money.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.640]   And so once I actually went through his bank statements
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.940]   and kinda got all the information from him,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.120]   I asked him, I was like,
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.640]   "Do you have an idea of when your business
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.680]   "is gonna maybe turn the corner
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.120]   "and you might start to be making money?"
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.800]   And he had no idea he was losing money.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.680]   - Right.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.200]   - And then I had the guy who,
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.880]   I ended up calculating his taxable income and say,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.520]   "Hey, you probably need to make this payment to the IRS."
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.160]   And I told him what his AGI was,
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.220]   and he was like, "No, that's impossible.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.560]   "There's no way I made that much money."
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.800]   But he actually did.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   But he had no idea because he wasn't looking
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   at the financials or even taking anything into account.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.920]   All he did was look at his bank account.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.820]   Cash was still there, so life was good.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.600]   - I've had this comment so many times on the show
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.260]   with listeners email me privately,
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.560]   just simply with the tip that I've given
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.460]   of make sure that when you create your cash flow statement,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.980]   you include your tax liability on there.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.480]   And nobody ever does that,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.700]   to actually look and say, "Where is my money going?"
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.380]   But sometimes just including that calculation in
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.640]   dramatically changes the perspective
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.980]   of how profitable is my job.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.740]   And when you actually go through and you look
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.040]   and you figure out, "Okay, what's my tax liability?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.420]   "What is it costing me to work at this job
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.520]   "that's way across town for which I have to do
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.860]   "all of this fancy work?"
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.220]   If you actually sit down and look
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.320]   and understand the numbers and say,
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.680]   "Am I making money?
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.560]   "How much money am I making?
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   "What's my hourly rate?
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.620]   "What are my goals?"
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.700]   It affects your decisions.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.300]   And I've had several listeners email me,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.820]   and it's been from both husbands and wives,
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.660]   and say, "We sat down and we looked at it
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.900]   "and we decided why are we wasting,
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.920]   "one of us is going to work, and there's no point in it.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.460]   "And so now I, as the husband,
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.520]   "I'm gonna stay home from work and my wife is working,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.740]   "and we've calculated that we're gonna be able
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.040]   "to live a better lifestyle with less work."
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.180]   Or the wife, "I'm gonna be able to stay at home
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.860]   "and we're gonna live a better lifestyle with less work."
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.860]   But you need the numbers to feel confident in that decision.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.300]   - Yeah, and I think that's exactly right.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.400]   And part of it too is doing it as you go.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.180]   I see a lot of people that wanna calculate it
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.820]   or figure something out at the end of the year.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.500]   And it makes it really tough to put together,
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.220]   I mean, you can put together some pretty detailed
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.060]   spreadsheets on, okay, here was my income
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.380]   for each payroll period, and here's what came out,
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.660]   and here's where it went.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.060]   But it's a lot harder, it's more laborsome,
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.720]   and you don't get a lot out of it
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.260]   because it's all way back in the past.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:42.140]   But you can also use it to help make decisions going forward
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.060]   but I've also noticed if you don't do it as often,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.620]   it gets less detailed, at least from a personal perspective.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.060]   And then some of these things you're gonna miss out on
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.700]   that maybe have been there if you were doing
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.740]   the detail each week.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.420]   - So I delivered pizzas for a week
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.200]   and this was not too long ago, it was about eight months ago
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.020]   and I was curious to see, I was trying to create
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.220]   a part-time income at a dead-end job
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.580]   without any connection and I just was trying to make
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.640]   about 2,500 or 3,000 bucks a month.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.020]   And so I was curious if I could do it delivering pizzas.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.980]   And it was also part of an interesting experiment.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.840]   But what I noticed is the first thing I wanted to know
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.820]   was I wanted to know how much money can you actually make
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.220]   with delivering pizzas.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.940]   And so I asked a bunch of people
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.500]   and I found some information online
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.620]   that it seemed like it would be in excess
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.540]   of 20 bucks an hour and I thought this would be fun.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.300]   It was always on my list of things that this would be.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.820]   And I said, man, 20 bucks an hour, it's not great
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.820]   but it's enough for a dead-end job, it would be ideal.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.340]   But I went and started asking some of the people
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.580]   who were delivering pizzas and I said,
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.340]   how much money are you actually making?
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.900]   Nobody knew the answer to it.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   And the very first thing I did was I had a notebook.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.840]   I recorded every minute of my time,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.120]   of the amount of time that I needed to drive
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.360]   from my house to the location.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.280]   I recorded every single call.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.400]   I recorded the number of miles driven every single night.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.520]   I calculated the cost of wear and tear and gasoline.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.960]   I calculated the hourly rate, the tip rate.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.640]   I averaged it out per
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.360]   per delivery.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.320]   I averaged and I started tracking to see,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.160]   is there anything that I can do
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.360]   that's gonna increase the number of deliveries in a night?
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.660]   Is there anything I can do that's gonna increase
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.560]   the amount of the tips?
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.880]   I tried things like calling to let them know I'm on my way,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.940]   shooting a text, just different ideas
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.060]   that I had to deliver customer service.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.800]   And in five days, I knew that this was
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.240]   a complete waste of time.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.160]   It was a total dead-end and there was nothing
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.240]   that I could do and my hourly rate was atrocious.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.200]   But as I'm talking with some of the other drivers,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.120]   I recognized that nobody was approaching
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.040]   their occupation from a business perspective.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.760]   And it was a fascinating experience to me
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.520]   because some of them really enjoyed what they were doing
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.820]   and they'd been doing it for a long time.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.840]   And others had a very poor attitude
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.920]   and it was just like, I can't believe
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.960]   I have this horrible job.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.800]   And I'm looking at it saying, have you sat down
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.960]   and calculated what it's worth?
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.240]   And just the simple ability to,
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.440]   there was no math involved,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.800]   but just simply writing things down
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.720]   and calculating the cost and averaging it out.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   Again, I could make a career decision
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.000]   and I knew it practically the second day,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.900]   but I would've said, well, I'll work it through a weekend
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.780]   and then I'll just see if there's something wrong.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.120]   I did it for a week and I knew,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.640]   this is an absolute waste of my time.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.960]   There's no point in my pursuing this.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.840]   But that business, if I could teach
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.960]   some of the other people that approach,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.080]   it would change their mindset
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.980]   about the opportunities they pursue.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.560]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.240]   And it's kind of funny, I guess people working on salary
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.480]   and public accounting, no one ever wants to,
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.240]   no one ever wants to calculate their hourly wage
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.320]   'cause everyone assumes it's really low
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.240]   based on the hours put in during your business season
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.280]   and tax, but I've kind of calculated mine.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.880]   I think it's a little higher than what people
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.160]   actually think it is, but again,
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.400]   you never know if you never run the calculation, right?
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.440]   - Right, right.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.640]   So keep going, I derailed you,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.080]   but I just thought it's important
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.760]   to have a motivation for this.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.040]   And if you can get a motivation and you can recognize,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.600]   I don't have to pursue this course of action,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   I can pursue this other, or at least if you have a reason.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.560]   I have a friend of mine that was,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.080]   he was commuting an hour and a half in the morning
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.500]   and two hours in rush hour traffic home
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.800]   to go to a mid-level corporate job.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.360]   And I sat down and I said, let's run the calculation.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.500]   Unless you're convinced that this mid-level corporate job
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.720]   is actually going to lead to another step
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.000]   and that's part of your career plan
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.400]   and you're paying your dues to make this next step,
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.160]   my goodness, man, quit and go to the grocery store next door
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.800]   and you'll have a better quality of life
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.640]   even though you're making $9 an hour
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.160]   instead of $50,000 a year when you actually look at the cost.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   So these economic transactions are extremely important,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.680]   but I derailed you from your outline, so keep going.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.520]   - Yeah, and so to get back on track,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.000]   you were right there basically,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.200]   is if you change your mindset on bookkeeping,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.480]   actually do it and get a system in place,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.600]   you're gonna be able to get some valuable information
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.680]   out of your business.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.160]   To list just some basic things,
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.320]   things like where do I make the most money,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.440]   you know, I have product X and product Y,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.840]   you know, product X has a 40% profit margin,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.680]   the other one has a 5% profit margin,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.240]   well, what can I do to sell more of the higher margin
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.560]   product and less of the lower one,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.800]   and you never know that unless you really
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.400]   kind of run the numbers on it.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.360]   And you can also get a high level picture of which expenses,
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.680]   which expenses a business has and what you can cut out.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   So if you're looking, if you look at your business,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.520]   you're like, man, half of my gross profit goes to rent.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.840]   Well, what can you maybe do about that?
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.640]   Do you need a storefront or do you need an office?
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.400]   Can you work from home?
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   But again, if you don't run the numbers
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.240]   and don't actually have it in the system,
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.120]   you're never gonna know exactly how much
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.160]   your rent is coming out to be,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.620]   and it could be for any expense.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.680]   I've only had one person that I've ever worked with
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.400]   that really, he didn't really keep any records,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.720]   but he knew exactly how much he was making
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.520]   and what was going where.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.720]   I think he's just a really smart guy
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.920]   and really in tuned to how his business worked,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.760]   but besides him, I've never seen anyone
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.600]   that just knew off the top of their head
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.160]   exactly how much they made
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.320]   or how much of their percentage was going to this expense
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.360]   and things like that.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.600]   And so when I say to change your mind,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.060]   mindset on bookkeeping,
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.200]   and you kind of need to understand all this stuff,
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.300]   I'm not saying that everyone needs an accounting degree
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.040]   or to go out and pass the CPA exam.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.120]   It's not needed for the average entrepreneur out there,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.000]   but it is important to start to understand
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.320]   the basics of how your bookkeeping works
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.160]   and the drivers of your business,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.360]   like income or expenses.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.880]   - And it can lead to a competitive advantage
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.160]   where I've worked with some entrepreneurs
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.600]   that I found I learned a lot from,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.800]   and I also have taken some classes from some marketers.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.080]   And one thing I remember,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.340]   I think it was Dan Kennedy made a big point of this
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.080]   in one of the courses of his that I went through.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.320]   He talked about the importance of understanding
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.200]   the lifetime value of a customer
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.720]   so that you can understand how much you can afford to pay
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.760]   for a client and pay to acquire a customer.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.480]   And people, we know this,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.720]   you see this, for example,
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.040]   at something like the grocery store,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.440]   and we're familiar with,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.840]   you go into the grocery store
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.020]   and sometimes they have these products that are on sale
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.120]   at such a low price.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.320]   And you say, they're losing money on that.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.040]   The example that comes to mind is here,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.360]   the grocery store we use
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.640]   is a Southern regional chain called Publix.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.240]   And at Thanksgiving,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.280]   you can buy turkeys for 60 cents a pound at Publix.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.480]   And you say, that is, they're losing money on that.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.680]   Well, they're establishing a loss leader
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.760]   so that they can make it up
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.160]   on all of the other ingredients that you buy
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.520]   to create your Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.060]   And I have a friend that works in the warehouse
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.080]   and he says, they overbuy the number of turkeys
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.840]   they need by a massive number
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.040]   because they will not run the risk of running out of turkeys
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   but they lose money on every turkey.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.720]   So why?
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.320]   Well, because once you keep that customer,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.360]   you make up your profit margin in another area.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.200]   And so in something like a business,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.840]   a direct mail business was the example
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.480]   that Dan Kennedy was teaching from,
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.000]   he will often pay money to acquire a client
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.240]   if you know the lifetime value of that client
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.800]   'cause that gives you a competitive advantage
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.080]   where maybe your competitor is saying,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.040]   well, this customer is only a $10 customer,
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.560]   only a $100 customer.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.800]   Well, if I can pay 150 bucks
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.620]   to acquire a $100 customer this year,
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.880]   but that customer is gonna go on
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.980]   to buy a thousand dollars worth of product from me,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.760]   then you can buy up the entire marketplace
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.960]   with your business, but that only happens
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.760]   if you have an accounting system
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.880]   that will accurately show how much money you're making.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.680]   It blows my mind in things like services,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.440]   for example, cell phone contracts or cable contracts.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.960]   Right now I have Comcast Cable.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.880]   It is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.340]   other than AT&T.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.160]   Those are my only two options for internet.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.880]   And they are horrendous.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.480]   And I can't bad mouth them enough
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.840]   because the service is awful.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.040]   And I sit down and I look at the lifetime value,
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.880]   where it was the worst.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.700]   I finally was able to get away from AT&T
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.080]   for cell phone service.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.560]   But I looked at it and I said,
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.280]   you give all of these cell phone companies,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.560]   and thankfully the market's changing,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.000]   but they give so much preference to new customers.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.440]   It was always about getting new customers,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.960]   new customers, new customers.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.080]   And I calculated how much I had paid to AT&T at one point.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   And I said, could you not actually be a little bit gracious
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.000]   with an existing customer
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.120]   and make me feel like a valued customer
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.360]   instead of making me feel like all you wanna do
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.200]   is go out and get new customers and not take care of me.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   Do you guys not know how to calculate
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.280]   the lifetime value of a customer that's a loyal customer?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.700]   And it just blows my mind
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.800]   when you look at some of these big businesses.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.480]   And anyway, I'm ranting,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.640]   but it all comes back to the accounting
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.880]   of recognizing the lifetime value of a customer.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.080]   And don't, as the scripture says,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.520]   don't despise, it's not scripture,
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.480]   don't despise the day of small beginnings, right?
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.600]   Don't despise the small client
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.720]   if you recognize that this small client could grow
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.800]   and the lifetime value of this customer can be massive.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.320]   But that comes back to your accounting system
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.500]   to know those details.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.280]   - Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.240]   And the next thing on here,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.880]   or the second point for the overall theme section is,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.280]   and we touched on it briefly earlier,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.520]   that your accounting needs to be simple.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.880]   If there's one thing that listeners get out of this podcast
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.500]   or one rule to follow
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.060]   is your accounting system needs to be simple.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.160]   And there's two main reasons for this.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.800]   The first one is that if you have a big, complicated system,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.560]   a lot of the times it's gonna provide little value to you
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.400]   with reference to how much time it actually took you
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.760]   to put that together.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.280]   And so if you're the average entrepreneur
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.220]   where you don't have a full accounting background,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.960]   you don't have a CPA license,
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.800]   you're just not trained with that,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.240]   if you have this big old complicated spreadsheet
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.740]   or this big old complicated report to look at,
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.680]   it's not gonna do you any good
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.060]   because you're not gonna know how to interpret it.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.220]   I've seen a lot of CEOs,
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.120]   the reports and the numbers that they look at,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.360]   there's like 10 numbers on them.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.160]   But the accounting department's putting together
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.520]   this entire financial statement
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.760]   and this entire system of numbers
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.160]   to track how the business is doing.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.360]   But when you look really at the top level,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.740]   they're looking at a few metrics
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.320]   and they want just this simple report
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.800]   'cause their time is valuable.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.640]   - Right.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.320]   - And I don't mean to compare entrepreneurs
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.440]   to huge company CEOs,
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.520]   but I think it carries over with the fact
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.160]   that your time is valuable as an entrepreneur.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.320]   You wanna be out there generating business,
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.280]   you wanna be out there providing content
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.760]   or making sure your customers are taken care of,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.280]   less time worrying about the numbers,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.560]   putting them in place and things like that.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.880]   And so the second reason is,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.720]   oh, did you have something?
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.780]   - No, just keep going.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.340]   - Okay, the second reason is that
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.000]   if you have a process that's complicated,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.600]   it's less likely that you're gonna actually do it,
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.200]   either weekly or monthly or quarterly,
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.700]   whenever you do your bookkeeping.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.920]   So you might keep it up for a few months
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.400]   or for a year and a half or something like that,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.720]   but the more complicated it is,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   the more time it's gonna take to keep the system up to date.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.800]   And so at the end of the day,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.920]   when you're tired and you just wanna go home
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.940]   and be with your family or do whatever you do,
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.740]   if you're staring at three, four, five, six, seven hours
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.560]   of bookkeeping work 'cause you got this big elaborate system,
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.300]   you're not gonna wanna do it.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.020]   And then all of a sudden you put it off
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.500]   and then you have 16 hours to do,
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.780]   then you have 20 and you have 25.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.300]   But if you have a simple process,
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.940]   it's easy to sit down for a half hour or an hour,
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.780]   just do it real quick
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.940]   and then you have all the data you need.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.100]   And so simple--
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.080]   - Yeah, that one is my problem
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.480]   is I tend to overcomplicate everything.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.360]   And including with bookkeeping, with everything,
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.880]   I always, my character weakness is,
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.040]   and I have to be very careful of it,
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.880]   that doesn't hurt me,
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   is to go for the most elaborate system I can come up with,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.520]   just 'cause it's fun and I feel cool.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.280]   And I have to constantly remind myself, keep it simple.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   - Yeah, with working at a public account,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.300]   there's a lot of people that are really good with Excel
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.620]   and they build these elaborate spreadsheets
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.900]   to do this and do that.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.540]   And then I sit down and look at it and I'm like,
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.620]   well, what's the main point of this thing
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.820]   and what do we actually need to get to the end system?
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.900]   And a lot of times it's 20% of the work
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.940]   that they're actually doing.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.480]   And I did the same thing with my own personal finances.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.580]   I tried to come up with something that was big and elaborate
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.680]   and got all the data I needed,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.860]   but I ended up just paring it down
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.200]   to just a simple thing that I can do
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.460]   for 10 minutes, 10, 15 minutes each weekend,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.260]   and boom, I have all the data I need.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.780]   I have by month, I have by year.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.100]   And so simple, I think, really is the best rule.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.700]   It gives you a lot of value
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.460]   for the amount of time you're putting in
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.620]   and it'll give you a higher likelihood
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.740]   of actually doing it week in and week out,
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.520]   as opposed to doing it for a while and then stopping
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.640]   and all of a sudden you're back at square one.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.960]   - So where do you start as an entrepreneur?
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.480]   I wanna set up a simple system.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.700]   Where do I start?
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:21.320]   - So the easiest way is probably,
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.020]   well, depending on the type of business,
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.200]   you probably just wanna get it in Excel
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.880]   and just track everything that you spend
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.780]   and everything that's coming in.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   And so the system, I guess, of recording a transaction,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.320]   I have down a little later in my outline here,
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.400]   but it does kinda lead into the next topic I have here,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.020]   which is the first thing you wanna do
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.540]   is open a business checking account and get a credit card.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:57.540]   And so when you have your checking account
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.380]   and your credit card,
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.020]   you only wanna put your business expenses
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.260]   in that account and on that card.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.220]   And you wanna put all of your business expenses
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.580]   in the account on the card.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.220]   And the main reason is segregation.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.300]   So you want your personal stuff in one area,
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.580]   you want your business stuff in another area
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.220]   so that it's easy to track, easy to follow.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.600]   You do not wanna mix the two.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.860]   When you start mixing the two,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.380]   paying for business expenses out of your personal account
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.460]   or you're a little low on money
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.080]   in your personal account this month,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.900]   so you're gonna take out of your business account,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.460]   starts to complicate things.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.060]   And in the grand scheme of things,
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.460]   it's not that hard to account for it,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.220]   but at the same time, for a system as an entrepreneur,
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.920]   you want something that's easy, almost repetitive,
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.100]   where you don't necessarily have to think about it too much,
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.020]   at least with recording the data.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.940]   And then when you actually get it nice and organized,
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.000]   you can start to think about it more and analyze it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.100]   And so--
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.680]   - I'll add one-- - The reason--
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.760]   - Let me add one tip to that.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.680]   Yes, set up a separate account,
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.240]   set up a separate business checking account,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.440]   but it doesn't actually have to be
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.240]   a business checking account.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.000]   Many banks, the personal checking account is free,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.700]   and the business checking account,
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.320]   they'll charge a fee or you have to maintain
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   some kind of higher minimum balance.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.360]   The primary purpose,
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.720]   especially just for a simple enterprise,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.680]   the primary purpose is to have the account segregated
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.640]   for easier bookkeeping,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.720]   and so that you can simply go back through
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.440]   and just have everything organized.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.800]   And so even at the end of the year,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.440]   if you had no other system,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.840]   let's say you were mowing lawns on Saturday,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.320]   or, and that was just your little thing,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.680]   and all you did was just add
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.120]   a little free personal checking account,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.440]   but you use your,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.280]   you're not establishing a separate business entity,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.640]   you're not, you don't need a formal business checking account
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.720]   in the name of Joshua's Lawn Service,
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   it's just Joshua Sheets,
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.120]   by having everything in a separate account,
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.780]   you go back at the end of the year,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.480]   you look at your 12 monthly statements,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.240]   you can go through, and in about an hour,
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.440]   you can recreate all of your tax records
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.360]   that you need to file your Schedule C.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.840]   So don't let the business checking account
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.620]   part of it stand in your way.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.500]   Just set up a separate personal checking account.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.020]   And if you have something where,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.480]   for example, you have a small part-time business,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.600]   whether it's a hobby that you've decided
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.620]   to turn into a business,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.820]   so now you're pursuing it in a business-like manner,
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.980]   run everything out of a separate account,
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.040]   so that you can look back at the end of the year
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.680]   and decide, what do I do with the income from this business,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.080]   what do I do with the expenses?
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.580]   It's just the easiest, simplest way to run things.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.180]   - Yes, that's exactly right,
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.220]   and that's actually the main reason I had listed here
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.860]   for why you wanna open a separate account.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.620]   It makes everything electronic,
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.540]   it makes everything in one place.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.860]   And so, when everything's in one place,
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.440]   like you said, it's easy to account for,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.140]   easy to recreate statements,
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.540]   you're also less likely to lose tax deductions.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.860]   And so, I have clients that they, I don't know,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.100]   go to the post office and mail something for their business,
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.640]   or they go get gas for their business vehicle
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.100]   that they make deliveries in,
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.140]   and they pay it out of their personal account.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.500]   And so, when you hand over your stuff
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.780]   to either your bookkeeper or your tax person,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.420]   or maybe even you do it yourself,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.540]   you're gonna go pull the account
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.380]   that's dedicated to business,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.780]   and those payments to the post office
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.700]   and the gas station aren't gonna be there.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.300]   And so, depending on how long it's been
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   since you've incurred those transactions,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.500]   you may forget that you actually paid
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.580]   those amounts for your business,
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.540]   and so you're gonna lose those deductions.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.180]   And one thing about losing deductions
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.740]   that always kind of gets people to perk up
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.260]   and actually listen about it is,
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.680]   if you're in a 35% tax bracket,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.980]   if you don't account for $100 expense
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.340]   that you had for your business,
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.380]   it's almost as if you're just taking $35
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.860]   and just lighting it on fire.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.020]   Because that's additional tax
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.660]   you're gonna have to pay to the government
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.820]   because you didn't record that expense.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:09.020]   And then, also, with the accounts,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.860]   everything is gonna be on statements.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.520]   And so, like you said, you can go back through,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.260]   categorize all your expenses,
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.020]   and put it on your tax return.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.780]   And with the statements, the electronics,
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.660]   you can email them around easier,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.020]   or put them on some sort of SharePoint site
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   for your tax person or bookkeeper, whoever,
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.500]   and they can grab them real quick,
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.060]   as opposed to, I know some people get the paper statements
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:35.900]   and you can scan them in,
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.540]   but at least from my perspective,
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.340]   electronics is a lot easier to work with.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.180]   - Right.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.700]   And my reason for mentioning that,
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.340]   and it's not to say that we don't need business accounts,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.140]   you do, if you're gonna be paying,
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.340]   I mean, there is a functionality to a business account,
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.660]   and we need to set that up properly
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.620]   and set up your tax ID numbers,
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.180]   you do need to do it properly.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.100]   But I see so many people that run little,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.660]   you know, sideline enterprises,
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.140]   little part-time enterprises.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.780]   Example that I think of, when I was a kid,
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.640]   I used to raise and sell rabbits.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.300]   And something like that,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.860]   let's say somebody has a hobby of raising rabbits.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.460]   Well, all I needed to do,
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.440]   if I'd had a little bit better instruction,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.040]   is have a checking account for my rabbits,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.940]   and that's the business that runs through that.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.860]   And now, all of the things associated with that
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.100]   become deductions.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.140]   So the books that I bought on rabbits,
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.140]   instead of them, you know,
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.820]   because they were specifically related
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.260]   to my focus of building that business up,
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.680]   and I was actively pursuing it in a business-like manner,
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.660]   now all of a sudden,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.860]   every activity that's associated with my rabbits
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   becomes a business,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.760]   and it becomes a business deduction.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.300]   And there are many little businesses
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.940]   that people can set up,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.500]   and little businesses that people can run,
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.580]   and you don't have to pursue a business 60 hours a week
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.340]   to have a legitimate business.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.060]   And it's not that difficult to do,
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.700]   it's just that most of us, we're taught by employees,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.960]   most of our teachers that we have throughout our life
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.860]   are employees, and so, and very few of us,
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.060]   unless we have a mentor that comes along and says,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.220]   here, let me show you how to set this up,
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.140]   we don't know how to go through the simple mechanics
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.860]   of keeping a separate account.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.820]   But I think everybody, you know,
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.900]   is gonna have some, should probably have
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.620]   some kind of side business, and it's so simple.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.740]   Separate account, file a schedule C on your tax return,
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.660]   and you're basically done.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.340]   So correct me if I'm wrong in any of that,
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.620]   but to keep it simple is very important
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.500]   to lower the barrier to entry.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.900]   I get questions from friends,
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.860]   well, I need to go and do this,
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.780]   I need to go and do that.
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.220]   Listen, even if, yeah, get your taxpayer ID number
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   if you wanna set that up, that takes you about five minutes,
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.620]   it's not that tough.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.300]   You don't need a bunch of expensive stuff,
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.820]   it's basically free, it's not that tough.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.060]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.540]   If you're running a small-time thing,
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.060]   especially if you're a minor,
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.140]   you definitely don't need a separate
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.060]   business checking account.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.740]   A separate personal one would be fine.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.860]   One thing that I like about the business checking accounts
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.340]   and, is that you don't have to use your social.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.180]   - Right, right.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.100]   - So each entity needs some sort of identifier.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.660]   So for us as individuals, we have our social security number
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.020]   to identify ourselves to the government.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.300]   Businesses have what you mentioned in EIN,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.180]   an employer identification number.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:27.460]   And so when people, when you're in business,
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.460]   a lot of people will ask for this sort of stuff,
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.540]   they'll give you a W-9 or a 1099 or something,
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.220]   and you need to give them some sort of number.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.220]   And so if you don't have that EIN
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.780]   or that bank account that kind of shows,
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.100]   like hey, this is my EIN, this is my documentation,
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.540]   sometimes you have to give it that social.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.040]   And I know identity theft has been a big thing
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.820]   coming up recently, especially with people
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.480]   filing fraudulent tax returns.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.220]   So I don't necessarily mean to or intend to scare people,
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.700]   but at the same time, it's important to some people
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   and it's definitely something to be cautious about.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.900]   And there are business checking accounts out there
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.360]   that are free, especially if you have a smaller enterprise.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.260]   And so I, at the local credit union here in Boise,
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.300]   I can have up to 1,000 transactions a month
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.700]   and not be charged a fee.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:29.700]   And so if your business is having less than $1,000 a month,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.640]   you could have a free business checking account
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.720]   and all the benefits that come with it.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.380]   But with the business checking account,
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.500]   they like to add fees to everything,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.140]   so it's harder to transfer money electronically
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.180]   without having some sort of system
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.480]   that's a fee from the bank, things like that.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.420]   And so that's, I guess, my spiel
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.540]   on the business bank accounts.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.020]   If people want to open one up,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.420]   all you gotta do is go down to your bank and say,
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.460]   hey, I wanna open up a business checking account.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.520]   You can open, from what I've seen,
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.760]   there's no online business checking accounts.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.180]   I know some people like the online banking.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.940]   I've only seen online savings accounts.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.620]   But to open a checking account,
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.180]   all you need is your EIN from the IRS,
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.700]   which you mentioned before.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.580]   You can do it online, takes less than five minutes.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.820]   You can ask for either electronic or paper letter
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.060]   from the IRS and you'll get your EIN.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.180]   And then you probably need some sort of documentation
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.340]   from the secretary of state.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.420]   So each state has a secretary of state.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:36.420]   In Idaho, if you wanna fill out a DBA or an LLC,
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.180]   you just need to send a one-page form
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.640]   to the secretary of state.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.240]   They'll stamp it, mail it back,
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.020]   bring those two things into the bank.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.300]   And at least in my experience,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.020]   that's all you really need to open up
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.420]   your business checking account and get going with that.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.240]   - Right, I agree.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.580]   And I will reaffirm your mention of local credit union.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   When I shopped for business checking accounts,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.580]   I went to the big banks and all just the fees
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.380]   were, in my opinion, egregious.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.780]   But local credit union, completely free, no fees.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.500]   Had to maintain a very small balance.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.980]   I even forget what it is, but a very small balance
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.940]   in an attached savings account
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.400]   at that specific local credit union
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.860]   and a free business checking account.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.560]   Super easy, completely free,
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.860]   and they will offer you better service over time.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   And I like to support local credit union regardless.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.180]   - Yep, yep, definitely.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.380]   I've had bad experience with larger banks.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.260]   Local credit union, I've never had anything happen.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   I had an issue once, but they fixed it really quick.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:42.060]   Unlike some other experiences at larger banks.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.980]   - Put it this way, I will bad mouth SunTrust
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.960]   'til the day I die.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.020]   They destroyed me.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.660]   That was where my first business checking account was.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:54.700]   I will never again do business with that company
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.520]   in any way, shape, or form.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.420]   It was just a terrible experience.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.580]   And there are enough, anyway,
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.060]   so there, I bad mouthed them publicly.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.500]   That's the first time I've bad mouthed them on the show.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.920]   I pretty much keep my mouth shut about most companies,
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   but I'll never do business again with them in my life.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.540]   - I have one bank in mind as well,
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.580]   but I won't mention it on the show.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.420]   - All right, keep going.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.860]   - All right, so the next tip here
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.620]   is to avoid using cash for your business.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.940]   And I know a lot of people like to use cash.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.860]   If people are on the Dave Ramsey budget,
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.620]   you have your cash envelopes,
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.020]   and it helps people with budgeting.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.500]   Say, okay, I have $80 or $100 or whatever
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.300]   that I can spend at the grocery store.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.020]   I can't buy more than $100 'cause that's all I have.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.060]   But for business purposes,
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.380]   especially when you're trying to do bookkeeping
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.900]   and get everything ready for taxes,
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.420]   cash makes it really hard.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.180]   And it goes against the simple concept
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.540]   that I was mentioning before.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.880]   The main reason is that cash is really, really,
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.420]   really easy to lose track of.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.460]   And so you could pay for something with cash
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.860]   and say, oh, that's a business receipt,
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.300]   but then you lose the receipt.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.820]   Or you're not used to keeping your receipts
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.460]   and you get it for your business
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.820]   and you just throw it away.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.260]   We talked about the segregation concept earlier.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.740]   You could pay for something
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.380]   with the wrong kind of source of funds.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.760]   I'm putting that in air quotes here,
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.100]   with the wrong source of funds
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.260]   to kind of keep everything balanced at your business.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.580]   And there's lots of other reasons,
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:33.860]   but the main reason is the most transactions
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.540]   I see not recorded on a tax return
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.460]   come from the owners using cash
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.180]   and not remembering to tell someone about it
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.500]   or keep the receipt.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.800]   'Cause it's easy to remember that day,
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.900]   but especially if you're busy,
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.600]   even the next day it's hard to remember,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.340]   oh, I need to make a note about this cash purchase
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.100]   or the next week or the next month.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.220]   You're never gonna figure it out.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.460]   So cash is really, really easy to lose track of.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.380]   And then some people have multiple businesses going on.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.820]   They have multiple Schedule Cs
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.740]   or if you're into rental properties,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.780]   you have your Schedule E.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.740]   Just multiply kind of all the things I mentioned
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.340]   by two or three in terms of complication
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.380]   and that'll get you how important it is
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.140]   for the multiple business side.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.880]   Because now all of a sudden you got a business expense
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.720]   that you have to remember,
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.980]   you have to keep the receipt for.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.980]   And then you gotta remember which business it should go on.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.260]   And so the people I've seen with multiple business,
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.260]   it gets tough to remember which business it's for.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.660]   It's a lot easier, okay, as I'm doing that transaction,
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.500]   I pull out the credit card for this business
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.860]   or I pull out the credit card for the other business,
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.660]   run the transaction through
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.500]   and then it'll just show up on that statement
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.220]   and then it's easy to categorize.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.260]   And so, go ahead.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.740]   - I was gonna say, cash is definitely
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.900]   the ultimate discipline factor.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.260]   So for somebody who needs discipline
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.140]   and someone's deeply in credit card debt,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.780]   trying to get control of spending for the first time,
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.820]   building in that discipline factor
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.980]   of not actually physically being able to overspend,
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.300]   I think that's a huge advantage.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.180]   But once that basic discipline factor is established,
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.500]   you're exactly right, you've gotta be able to track it.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.860]   I've never met someone who is, including me,
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.900]   who has the personal discipline
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.580]   to actually record every transaction
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.740]   and have a proper journal or ledger of their cash
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.340]   so that they can know where every dollar goes.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.100]   Most people, it just seems to slip through their fingers
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.600]   quicker than anything else.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.100]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.380]   And you can, I mean, you can use cash for your business.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.500]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.060]   - You just have to up your game on documentation
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.820]   and remembering what came from where
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.500]   and recording everything.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.900]   And I'll tell you, even for me,
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.660]   sometimes if I use cash for my personal stuff,
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.900]   sometimes I forget to record it.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.420]   And it's like, I do this for a living.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.660]   - Right, me too.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.980]   - So other entrepreneurs, I think there's a less likelihood
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.200]   of the cash transaction actually being recorded.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.520]   And the other thing that cash will do,
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.780]   we talked about the checking account
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.560]   and having everything kind of electronic
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.720]   on those statements.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.860]   Cash won't show up on the statement.
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.940]   And one thing I was gonna mention
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.500]   with the business credit card,
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.200]   you don't necessarily need a credit card.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.540]   I know some people don't like credit cards,
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.340]   they like the debit cards, that's fine.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.820]   The main reason with a credit card
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:39.000]   is you want some form of electronic payment.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.700]   And so your debit card,
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.360]   it's depending on how you think about it,
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.640]   you could view that as cash kind of being recorded
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.720]   in your bank account.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:54.600]   But cash will add complexity to the system
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.640]   just 'cause it's one more thing you have to do.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.120]   And we talked about being simple,
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.880]   having something that's repetitive.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.960]   And you could make cash a repetitive nature
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.840]   in your accounting system,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.740]   but it's just, at the end of the day, it's just tougher.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.540]   - Yeah, cash speaks.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.620]   And there are, I think,
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.060]   if you can get a discount by using cash.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.740]   I recently had a financial transaction
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.300]   and just one of my things
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.900]   as a part of just about any financial transaction I can
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.160]   is listen, can I get a discount for cash?
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.320]   And the person said yes,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.260]   I was able to get a discount for cash.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.260]   But I don't have an excellent accounting system
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.260]   established to deal with that.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   So what I did was I made sure to go directly to the ATM,
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.440]   take out the specific amount of cash I needed
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.940]   for the transaction.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.260]   I got my substantial cash discount
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.940]   by handing over $20 bills.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.900]   I got my receipt and I had a series of ATM withdrawals,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.820]   one after the other, totaling the exact amount.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.580]   And then that spurred me to have in my mind
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.860]   the amount of money that I need.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.860]   It spurred me to make a note of,
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.660]   yes, here was the transaction,
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.700]   it's recorded in my accounting system,
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.220]   but I was able to get the discount for cash.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.300]   Every business might be different.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.420]   I gotta imagine it'd be unusual for an accountant
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.940]   running an accounting practice to be thinking about
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.300]   how do I go and get a discount on Craigslist
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.220]   for this certain thing.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.260]   But I tell you, there are some businesses
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.900]   where having a bunch of cash in your pocket
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.580]   and buying stuff on Craigslist,
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.060]   that can improve your profitability massively.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.100]   So you just gotta set up a system
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.220]   that's gonna account for your specific business.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.860]   - Yep, yep, I have a client that has the same thing.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:40.380]   He goes in SwapMeet where basically everything's cash
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.820]   and he picks up some really good deals there.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.860]   The problem is just trying to record everything
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.500]   'cause he'll take out, I don't know, a thousand,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.780]   two thousand dollars, go to the SwapMeet,
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.060]   buy a bunch of things, and it's really hard
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:57.300]   to kind of break down what each item costs
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.900]   'cause you're not necessarily getting a receipt
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.460]   at the SwapMeet showing everything.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.900]   So if you're disciplined enough, cash can work,
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.220]   especially if you can get a good deal on it.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.340]   I think that would kind of up your game
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.660]   on the discipline part.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.900]   But at the same time, it's tough to track.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.900]   So it has its place,
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.580]   but it's just something to be conscious of.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.140]   - My suggestion, envelope, put the thousand dollars
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.080]   in the envelope, take a pen with you.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.980]   When you buy something, write it on the envelope,
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.600]   what it was, how much it was, put all the change in,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.080]   and then just bring that envelope back
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.860]   and on the front of it, you've got your ledger
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.860]   and transfer that to your standard accounting system.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.840]   It's the best way that I've done.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.060]   I do that when I'm traveling
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.700]   and you're dealing with foreign currency
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.420]   and a foreign account, and I wanna know
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.700]   what am I actually spending here.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.860]   Just toss the money in an envelope
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   and write every transaction on the front cover of it.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.620]   - Yeah, yeah, I've given him some ideas to track it,
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:51.220]   but he's not in tune with the bookkeeping side
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.400]   of the business, so I just deal with it later.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.380]   - So boogie on here.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:01.740]   - Yep, so the next tip here is to use
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.660]   some sort of accounting software,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.780]   and depending on the type of business you have,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.660]   you can have a lot to track or little to track,
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.100]   and depending on the size of your business,
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.160]   you may have funds to pay for something like this or not,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.220]   but the accounting software, something like a QuickBooks
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:23.980]   or a FreshBooks, I think those are the two popular ones
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.140]   out there that I see, it saves you a lot of time.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.860]   If you have an Excel spreadsheet to track everything
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.260]   and record all of your expenses into these categories
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.700]   and you have formulas and all that stuff,
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.460]   it's nice to have, but a lot of that stuff
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.460]   takes a lot of manpower to keep up each week
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:50.860]   or each month and record all the transactions,
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.340]   and it's easy to have user error with those,
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:57.220]   and then if you have that, it's tough to find them later.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.260]   What I've seen with an accounting system,
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.300]   a lot of those things, there's less likelihood
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.340]   of those happening, and the amount of time
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.640]   you need to record a transaction is just a lot, a lot less,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.660]   and so I see a lot of people that are intimidated
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.700]   by accounting systems, like, oh, I'm not an accountant,
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.860]   I can't possibly run QuickBooks or FreshBooks,
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.780]   I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know,
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.180]   to throw some accounting lingo, I don't know debits
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.340]   and credits and, I don't know, balance sheets
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.260]   and cash flow statements and all that stuff,
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.340]   but I think one thing that's important to know
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.680]   is mainstream accounting software
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.460]   is made for non-accountants.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.300]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.620]   - So if you're getting ready to send someone an invoice
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.620]   for some product that you sold them,
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.460]   and you literally go to a button
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.700]   and it says create an invoice, you click it,
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.580]   and boom, up pops an actual invoice,
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.060]   and you just fill it out with the client, the address,
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.480]   the item number, and everything calculates for you,
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.460]   and it literally looks like an invoice,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.660]   and all of the income statement accounts
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.420]   and expense accounts, all that gets recorded
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.820]   behind the scenes for you.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:06.540]   And so, and I say that, you need to kind of set up correctly
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.020]   and you can get a bookkeeper or someone
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.020]   to help you with that decently, cheaply,
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.460]   but it saves a lot of time and categorizes everything
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.380]   for you, especially if you're, it's easy,
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.300]   especially if you're not an actual accountant.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.240]   - And another suggestion, because the fees
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.300]   for QuickBooks and FreshBooks vary,
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.640]   they've got the upfront purchase amounts,
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   you can buy the program as an independent software program,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.760]   you can also do, for example, QuickBooks,
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.080]   you can do QuickBooks online,
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.880]   and then there's simply a monthly fee.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.080]   There are advantages and disadvantages for,
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:46.400]   I like the QuickBooks online, their app that they have,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.880]   which helps, I think, an entrepreneur
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.520]   to be able to often track their transactions
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.060]   a little bit more easily, to be able to do things on the go,
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.700]   right from their phone, pull things up,
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.860]   see their P&L, their profit and loss statement,
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.380]   right in the middle of the month.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.700]   But there's also the cost for it,
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.940]   and so some businesses, there may not be the benefit there
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.800]   of paying for the software if it's a very small business.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.060]   A free alternative that I've used
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:16.060]   is an open source program called New Cash, G-N-U-C-A-S-H.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.620]   I'm not sure if you've ever used it.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:21.120]   It's a little bit, for those who aren't familiar
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.000]   with accounting systems, just any kind of double entry
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.400]   bookkeeping system like QuickBooks
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.920]   is probably going to be a tiny bit intimidating
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.360]   for some people.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.360]   QuickBooks, I think, is pretty doable,
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   but if you want a free version of it,
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.220]   where you can have an accounting software
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.000]   that will go ahead and integrate transactions from the bank,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.920]   check out New Cash.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.560]   I've used that and found it to be perfectly adequate.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.160]   - Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.400]   I actually forgot about that program.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.560]   I had a buddy that mentioned that to me a few years ago,
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.040]   'cause he was using it for his personal accounting.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.280]   He doesn't have a business, but he's using it to track
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.400]   his wages and his tax withholding and all that stuff.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.680]   And he mentioned that, and I totally forgot about it,
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.160]   but thanks for mentioning that.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.920]   - And I think one other just comment that I have
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.540]   from my own personal experience.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.280]   I think it's important to look at the scale of your business
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.400]   to understand what's actually needed,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.000]   and then, as we mentioned earlier,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.240]   and then also to look at what is the makeup
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.320]   of your business.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.280]   So in my financial planning practice,
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.360]   for a time, I tried to use QuickBooks,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.540]   but what was frustrating is because I had set it up
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.660]   and made the mistake of using the bank to,
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:40.520]   using the transactions, allowing the software
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.600]   to automatically import the transactions
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.640]   from my checking account, that became a major problem,
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.280]   because I couldn't get it to easily reconcile
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.460]   the transactions that happened before money
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.880]   hit my checking account.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.440]   And so there were certain deductions and certain expenses
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.060]   and things that would get pooled before the money
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.940]   would actually hit my checking account.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.440]   So what I came up with that actually worked the best for me,
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.800]   and the other thing is I wanted a system
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.780]   that was slightly manual, because I find value
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.440]   in having a system that's not fully automated,
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.640]   so that I can question every expense.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.920]   So I would keep my checkbook registers,
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.560]   with physical paper checkbook registers,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   and then every few days, I would just sit down
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.880]   and it would take less than five minutes,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.940]   and I kept one ledger in an Excel spreadsheet,
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.440]   but with codes for each of the different businesses
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.960]   and returns that I would be filing.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.160]   I was filing multiple Schedule Cs.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.240]   And so I just had everything coded,
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.280]   and I'm very good with Excel,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.680]   so I was able to have a fully manual system,
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.000]   where my system wasn't being messed up
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.060]   by importing transactions, and I was able to fully account
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.920]   for all of the deductions that occurred
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.560]   before my pay would hit my account properly,
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.360]   and I was able to create it that it worked best for me.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.580]   So it was free, it kept the level of manual control
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.120]   that I needed to question the decisions
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.640]   and make sure that I was being most efficient
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.440]   with every transaction.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.360]   So I was able to make it work with an Excel system,
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.800]   but that doesn't scale very well
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.640]   once you get to the point
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.000]   where you're having lots of transactions.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.280]   So I think it is important for someone
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.400]   to design something that's gonna be ideal for their system,
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.040]   and my accountant didn't like it.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.640]   But I also fired that accountant
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.600]   'cause it didn't do a good job,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.640]   and I was able to do it more myself.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.760]   But anyway, keep going.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.240]   - Yeah, yeah, and I know on the bank import thing,
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.840]   I used to hate that as well,
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.560]   'cause I didn't want it to mess up
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.560]   and I liked to record it before it actually happened.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.080]   What QuickBooks Online and some of the other ones
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.100]   we'll do now is it'll import to like a,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.000]   it'll import to an area
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.680]   that's not really recorded in your system,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.600]   and then it'll try and match up
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.000]   what it's pulling from the bank account
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.560]   to what is recorded already,
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.440]   or what you have recorded already in QuickBooks.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.720]   And so what I do is I go into,
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.280]   if I'm going into either my own
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.760]   or to a client's QuickBooks Online,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.120]   I go to the bank area,
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.920]   and then it has a list of transactions there from the bank,
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.560]   and then if it's matched up,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.240]   it'll have a little green bubble basically,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.080]   and say, "Oh, do you agree
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.200]   "that this matches up with this transaction?"
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.440]   And you just hit agree, agree, agree.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.820]   And if I can't find something, you can manually match it up.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.060]   Or if it imports and you haven't recorded it yet,
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.780]   you can just select the account that it needs to go to
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.880]   and just hit record.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.620]   So that was my main problem before
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.340]   by I don't want transactions to be doubled up or anything,
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.860]   but I think they're getting better at it,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.100]   especially with the online stuff.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.180]   Even a year and a half ago,
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.660]   the online versions of these accounting programs
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.620]   weren't that great,
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.660]   especially if you were trying to track inventory.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.900]   But now I've seen them really make a lot of strides
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.120]   with making them better.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.780]   - Do you ever think though about,
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.520]   I guess, customizing solutions?
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.980]   'Cause the software systems are great,
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.300]   but one of the things I've noticed
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.260]   as people have asked me,
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.180]   for example, Mint is very popular.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.180]   I know people that just use Mint
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.160]   and they actually use it to account for their transactions.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.580]   It's free, you can do it right on your phone.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.140]   But it certainly has major flaws
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:32.980]   in that it's a,
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.220]   I guess we'll throw out the accounting,
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.260]   it's a single entry system,
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.340]   it's not a double entry system,
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.980]   it's not a proper accounting system
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.060]   that will work for producing your financial statements.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.260]   But one of the things I've realized
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.380]   is that people, by not doing things manually,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.940]   oftentimes people don't understand how their systems work.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.660]   So do you ever think though about consulting,
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.180]   especially with a young entrepreneur or new entrepreneur
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.700]   and saying, let me teach you how to do it manually
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.260]   for a little while,
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.900]   and then start working your way
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.500]   into a technological solution?
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.620]   Write it down, for example,
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.300]   keep a paper ledger or something like that.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.960]   Have you consulted with clients differently
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.620]   depending on their different situations?
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.580]   - Yeah, so I've consulted with trying
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.140]   to help them understand the process in general.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.940]   The main way that I do that is with the different reports
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.940]   and how the numbers and transactions
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.940]   will show up in different accounts.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.460]   'Cause it's easy when you're looking at the accounts
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.880]   to show them the double entry piece of the accounting.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.060]   But from my experience,
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.020]   the manualness of accounting,
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.780]   I've seen really no interest in from people
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.640]   because they want a quick, easy, simple solution.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.940]   And especially if, I've seen a lot of people,
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.820]   they like electronic now rather than a paper binder
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.300]   or something like that.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.540]   And so I've seen less of a interest in that
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.540]   and more of, okay, I just wanna understand
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.740]   the accounting in general and how it shows up
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.340]   into these, or how it gets to these different accounts
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.540]   on your trial balance or your balance sheet
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.340]   or something like that.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.020]   And I've noticed though, after I take people through that,
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.300]   it helps them start to understand
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.820]   what the accounting system's actually doing.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.740]   'Cause as we mentioned before,
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.180]   the accounting system is made for a non-accountant.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.220]   And so by doing it that way,
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.420]   you miss a lot of behind the scenes.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:37.340]   And starting to understand how or where things end up
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.780]   helps you to understand what the system is doing
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:44.700]   and then you can start to get a better grasp
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.220]   of your bookkeeping system.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.460]   - Yeah, it's a real challenge for a nerd like me
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.500]   to, why would somebody not be interested
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.860]   in learning it manually?
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.900]   But you're right.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.940]   And I think the next wave is the mobilization
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.740]   of everything I think is helping.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.460]   QuickBooks online, having the app
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.660]   and having everything fully integrated into the phone,
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.300]   that helps a ton.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.780]   And one of the changes is, instead of just simply,
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.020]   that I see of huge value,
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.180]   instead of just simply trying to take things
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.060]   and apply the desktop computer version to a mobile device,
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.460]   now by rethinking even the interface
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.060]   from a mobile perspective,
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.860]   I think that's helping a lot to have applications
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.260]   that people can just simply use
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   and that are more intuitive and less tied to the computer.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.820]   I think that's helpful 'cause still,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.900]   man, you open up QuickBooks
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.820]   and you look at the ledger on the computer,
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.660]   that's pretty intimidating for many people.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.340]   But going transaction by transaction
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.060]   with an automated system right on your phone,
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.420]   that's not so intimidating.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.620]   - Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.500]   And I know you mentioned the app before,
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.300]   which I think is a great idea
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.140]   and one thing that I recommend to clients
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.620]   that don't have a lot of time
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.380]   and stuff that I use for my own bookkeeping for my business.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.900]   And the one thing I would add is to what you said earlier
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.700]   is if you're using the app,
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.460]   I found a lot of people,
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.820]   they don't necessarily feel like they're doing bookkeeping.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.220]   'Cause when you think of doing bookkeeping,
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.100]   you look at it and you sit down and you get on my computer
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.380]   and you run through all these receipts
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.020]   and you categorize things.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.700]   But if you're on an app,
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.220]   when you're walking, I don't know,
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.340]   from a client to your car,
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.500]   you can pull it up real fast.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.620]   There's three things sitting there.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.900]   You can hit the certain buttons
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.100]   to categorize it a certain way and then you're done.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.180]   And so when you do it that way,
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.780]   you don't necessarily feel like you're doing the bookkeeping
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.020]   or keeping up with all the accounting,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.420]   but you actually are.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.540]   And so that's kind of an indirect way
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.980]   to stay on top of it, which I think is really good.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.820]   - Right.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.060]   And I wanna switch the order up
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.740]   on the outline that we're working from here
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.420]   and go to documentation and retention.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.220]   And I wanna encourage people,
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.540]   one of the things that I have found to be helpful
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.300]   is if you can establish a process for yourself
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.580]   that you go through.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:00.660]   For example, when I was having
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.140]   a lot of financial planning appointments,
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.940]   I would do quite a few meetings.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.580]   As a financial advisor, you eat a lot,
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.140]   you're out to restaurants a lot,
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.420]   you're tracking the coffee that you bought
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.780]   for your prospective client.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.020]   All these little, little things.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.300]   And if you can just simply create a habit
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.740]   where everything is done all at once
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.820]   that supports your bookkeeping system,
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.420]   I think it's a lot less intimidating
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.300]   than trying to sit down at the end of the month
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.820]   with a shoebox full of receipts
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.580]   and figure out here is where they go.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.220]   So I developed for myself a checklist.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.860]   I read years ago a book called "The Checklist Manifesto"
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.620]   and it absolutely convinced me
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.300]   that I need a checklist for anything worth doing.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:45.260]   And so I created a checklist for every meeting.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.540]   And over time, I just became memorized,
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.380]   but I printed it out.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.820]   And so I would leave the meeting
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.980]   and I used a mobile dictation.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.820]   So while I would leave the meeting,
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.100]   I would save the receipt,
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.900]   I would write on the front of the receipt,
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.660]   here was the person that I met with,
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.060]   here was what the business conversation was,
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.860]   I would make sure the amount was accurate,
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.260]   that it was clearly written.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.220]   Then I could just simply use my phone
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.220]   and just simply snap a picture of the receipt,
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.620]   tag that, upload it into my system,
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:15.980]   add it to the accounting software.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:19.500]   I used a mobile dictation service,
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.340]   I used CopyTalk, where I would simply phone in
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.020]   and I had a detailed, orderly way
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.260]   of recording client notes.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.260]   I met with this person, this is what we discussed,
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.180]   here were the action steps committed to,
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.180]   all of those things.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:36.180]   That showed up, flowed right into my to-do list,
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.380]   into my notes, import that into the client file.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.420]   Sounds complicated, but the point was,
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.660]   by sitting and taking 10 minutes,
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.980]   sitting in my car at the end of the lunch,
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.020]   and not rushing off to the next thing,
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.860]   I would be able to capture everything while it was fresh,
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.220]   I would be able to capture all of the details
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.620]   that I needed to substantiate the expense.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.600]   I had, if ever audited, I had the notes
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.860]   for the client appointment, okay,
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:06.300]   on January the 15th or January the 20th,
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.340]   yes, I did have this transaction,
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.140]   and yes, there was this entertainment,
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.300]   but here were the notes of,
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.980]   everything was substantiated.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.780]   And so you've gotta build a system for yourself
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.180]   to do it and stay current on it,
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.200]   otherwise you walk away from thousands of dollars.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.540]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly right,
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.140]   and that was my main point on the documentation receipts,
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.140]   is just writing on them.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.300]   You can get, there's a lot of value in your head
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.140]   right after the transaction occurs.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.980]   - Absolutely.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.100]   - You know exactly what was purchased,
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.300]   you know exactly what it was purchased for,
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.560]   if you have multiple businesses,
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.740]   you know which business it was for.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.060]   Like you were mentioning, if you're at a lunch or a dinner,
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.500]   you know who was in attendance
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.620]   and what the topic was of the meal.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.940]   And so all of that needs to get out of your head
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.100]   and onto the receipt right after you get it.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.840]   It takes, and you don't need a dissertation,
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.060]   you don't need a big long paragraph about the receipt,
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.620]   all you need is just certain notes
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.660]   so that when you're doing the bookkeeping later,
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.940]   'cause it sounded like you had a system
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.900]   that was all right away.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.580]   With a lot of the clients that I work with,
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.300]   they do a lot of documentation at their transaction
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.500]   and then they go ahead and record it later
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.820]   with their bookkeeping system.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:32.460]   And so if you have these receipts
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.060]   that you're looking at at the end of the week
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.340]   or the end of the month or the end of the quarter,
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.480]   you can look at 'em right away,
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.780]   flip it over on the back and say,
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.600]   oh, this was for Amanda and Todd,
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.440]   I went to lunch for them
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.640]   and we were talking about some marketing,
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.600]   we were talking about a marketing campaign for this product.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.720]   Then you have your documentation on the receipt right there
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.840]   and then you can record it accurately in your system.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.000]   And so if you have like a online version
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.400]   of the accounting software and if your bank imports it,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.380]   you can go find that transaction online
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.060]   and say, oh, this is that receipt.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.620]   You can say, yes, indeed, it was for Meals Entertainment
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.600]   and move on.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.920]   And some people don't necessarily like to do that
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.100]   'cause they can look at the receipt
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.140]   and figure out what it was for.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.140]   And this kind of goes back to your scale thing.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:23.980]   At the end of the month,
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:27.520]   if you're sitting there with 25, 30 receipts
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.900]   from various different places that were all
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.620]   for a general same category like Meals Entertainment,
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:38.060]   you're not gonna remember which meal was for which purpose
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.060]   and had which attendees.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.220]   And so if you can get it on the receipt
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.100]   right after the transaction occurs,
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.700]   it makes it a heck of a lot easier later.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.220]   You don't have to rack your brain trying to figure it out.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.300]   It saves you time, it gives you more brain power
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.020]   to be doing other things on your business.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.620]   - I think also if you have these records,
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.020]   and please correct me if you disagree,
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.260]   but I think if you have detailed records,
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:09.260]   you will feel much more confident with your system
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:14.500]   in order to be properly aggressive with your tax reporting.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.900]   Many times I think people are, they don't know the rules.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.260]   And so if you don't know the rules
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.980]   of what counts as Meals and Entertainment,
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.800]   what is just me goofing off,
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.140]   which is a non-deductible expense
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:30.140]   versus me having a business meal,
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.780]   oh, but it's connected to this entertainment expense
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.580]   and what do I need to know to,
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.180]   what was this entertainment, was there a business purpose?
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.660]   And people don't know.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.900]   And so then when they don't know, they tend to be vague.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.540]   And if you're vague, then you're like,
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.660]   well, I'm just gonna, you don't keep good records.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.600]   I say know the rules, follow the rules very carefully,
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.220]   and document them like crazy.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.980]   Set up a good system because the benefits of doing it
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.220]   financially are massive.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.180]   But you wanna make sure that A, you know the rules,
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.260]   that you're following them carefully,
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.060]   and with every transaction,
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.560]   that way you can substantiate your expenses.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.180]   And because you know and are following the rules
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.800]   and have a good system for accounting them, for them,
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.340]   you will feel much more confident.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.060]   Instead of feeling like the IRS is this big bad bully
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.640]   that's gonna come and beat you up,
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.080]   you're gonna feel confident.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.460]   I have followed the rules carefully,
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.060]   I've accounted for them, and I have a system that works
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.380]   so I don't freak out if I get an email from the,
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.700]   or a letter from the IRS saying, you know,
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.200]   our local revenue agent is gonna come for a visit.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.580]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.160]   And from a tax advisor perspective,
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.160]   we are inherently less risky with your tax return
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.940]   because if something's audited and changed
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.060]   and you owe more taxes, that comes directly back on us.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:53.060]   And so if you have, and I take a more aggressive stance,
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.220]   aggressive approach with taxes, you could say,
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:02.100]   but if there's not good documentation,
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.580]   I'm very hesitant to do that.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.420]   So if you send me a paper or a Post-it note like,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:11.220]   oh, I gave $4,500 in charitable contributions this year,
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.960]   me as a tax advisor, I'm not gonna necessarily like
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.700]   to put that on the tax return because all I have
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.900]   is basically that you said you had this amount
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.460]   to go on the tax return and so I gotta go
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.500]   through the whole spiel, you know,
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.640]   hey, you could be audited and if you don't have
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.580]   documentation, this could all be thrown out.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:35.100]   You know, I just wanna verify that you have receipts
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.860]   for all these expenses on here,
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.740]   for at least the charitable contribution side
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.720]   and kind of push it back on them.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.820]   But if you have good documentation,
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:51.340]   I can see that either as a bookkeeper or as a tax advisor,
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.780]   I really like that, it makes me a heck of a lot
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.540]   more confident in the tax return that I'm preparing
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.780]   or reviewing and you can be a little more aggressive
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.100]   with the IRS and get the benefits that come with that,
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.540]   which is essentially a lower tax bill
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.140]   that you are entitled to because these are actual
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.820]   business expenses that are deductible under the tax law.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.220]   - Right, and a better run business because you'll be able
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.460]   to know how profitable is my business,
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.060]   I know the numbers, I have controls in place,
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:23.460]   and I know that this is a worthwhile use of my time.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:26.180]   So it's a win all around to set up a good system.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.700]   Do you have any suggestions for how to actually
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.140]   hang onto this stuff and file all the information properly
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.380]   so that you have it for the needed amount of time?
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.220]   - Yeah, so I like to scan all of the receipts.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.580]   I think it's easier, it gives a lot less clutter
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.380]   and you can organize it better.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.700]   So with a paper file, you can't do a control F
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:54.580]   or do some other search through your receipts.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:57.900]   If you have a big box of receipts
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:58.740]   and you're looking for something,
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.760]   you literally have to look through every single one
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.980]   and hope and pray that the one you're looking for
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.220]   is towards the top so you don't spend a bunch of time
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.860]   looking at all these receipts.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.120]   And so, and I say scan, but a picture works,
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   just some sort of electronic receipt.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.900]   And so what I do is I, I think I'm a little meticulous
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.860]   on the documentation side with the receipts
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.260]   more than a lot of people like to do,
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.780]   but I like to have each receipt a separate file,
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.340]   either a PDF or a picture,
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:36.340]   and I like to organize it by date, vendor, and account type.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:41.280]   So if I took, if I had a business lunch at Chili's
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.020]   or something like that, I can do 2015, 20,
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.020]   or sorry, 2015, '01, '20 for January 20th, 2015,
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:54.700]   do a space, do Chili's, another space, Mills Entertainment,
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.260]   and then when I'm scanning my receipts,
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:00.020]   it has all the data I need there
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.860]   that you'd normally need when you're looking for a receipt.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.700]   It has the date, vendor, and expense type,
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:05.900]   especially if you're trying to go
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.180]   from your accounting system
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:10.100]   and find the receipt for that transaction.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.660]   And I will say on a lot of the apps
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.660]   or online versions these days,
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:19.980]   they have a way to attach a receipt to the transaction.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.140]   And so you don't necessarily need to keep a separate folder
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.740]   either backed up on an online storage
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.340]   or just on your computer.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.340]   You can tag it right there to the transaction.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.820]   And so when you're looking at it online,
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.340]   you can just click it open and boom,
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.140]   you can see the receipt right there.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:41.140]   Some people will do, they like the paper files still,
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:44.020]   and I think it's a viable option.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.180]   Again, it makes it harder to actually find something.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.300]   But if you're gonna go that route,
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.840]   I would organize by vendor.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.780]   A lot of the times, if you're looking,
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.700]   especially if you do a lot of purchasing, like inventory,
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.480]   a lot of times you'll be looking for a receipt
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.780]   from a specific vendor,
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.500]   not necessarily from a specific timeframe.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.540]   And you can have both,
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.620]   but most of the time you're gonna be looking
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.380]   for a specific vendor.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.960]   And so it's a lot easier to scan through vendor invoices
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.100]   that all look the same
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.100]   when you're trying to look for something
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.380]   as opposed to a big pile of stuff
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.660]   that's different sizes and different categories
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.700]   and different vendor types.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:31.300]   And so, and then another thing on the paper filing system
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:37.380]   is I would highly discourage trying to do it by,
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.200]   well, depending on how many transactions you have,
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.860]   but I would discourage to do it less
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.100]   by time.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.220]   So what I see a lot of people do
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:50.340]   is they'll have a shoebox or something
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.460]   for each month of the year,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.500]   or even for the entire year,
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.240]   and they'll just throw receipts in there.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.820]   Which it's fine from a retention standpoint,
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.160]   but I guess from a documentation
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.100]   and trying to find something,
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.980]   it makes it really difficult
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.860]   because at any specific timeframe,
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.380]   there could be a lot of different categories
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.860]   and a lot of different receipt types in there.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.100]   So I would encourage to do by vendor.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.460]   I see a lot of people do by year and by vendor.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.260]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.220]   Do you, so when you're doing it electronically,
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.860]   are you just keeping those as PDF documents
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.580]   in a file in Windows Explorer
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.640]   or whatever system you use?
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.660]   - Yep, I do, yep.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.460]   I upload it to something like a,
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.220]   or I keep a folder on my computer
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.180]   that's synced to something like a Dropbox
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.940]   or a OneDrive or something like that.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.260]   And it's just one folder.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.620]   A lot of people like to use multiple folders,
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.900]   and I don't necessarily like to do that.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.780]   I find it tougher to find stuff.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.700]   And so if I'm looking for something,
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.240]   I literally have to click into every folder.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.300]   If I don't know where it is,
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.140]   I have to click into every single folder
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.460]   to find something as opposed to
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.420]   if everything was just in one folder.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.800]   You can scan real quick.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.860]   You can even search by file name
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:06.860]   or by date to kind of narrow down the topics.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.220]   But yes, it is, I do all PDFs.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.260]   Each PDF has one receipt
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.460]   named with the date, vendor, expense type,
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:19.180]   and then it's all in one folder
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:21.300]   that's uploaded to the cloud.
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.500]   - What about Evernote?
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.260]   Do you ever use that or ever suggest to somebody
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.100]   they use an Evernote file for their receipt organization?
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.500]   - Not necessarily for the actual
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.980]   documentation of receipts,
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.280]   but I have recommended it before
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   for taking notes about various transactions.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.660]   And so this would be a good one,
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.100]   like I was talking about before,
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.820]   the client that goes to the swap meet
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.180]   and buys a bunch of stuff.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.700]   That would be a good one for him to pull it up,
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.980]   type into his phone what he's buying
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:57.540]   and what the cost was so that he can track it
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.620]   and we can record it later.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.940]   But I haven't recommended it
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.980]   and I haven't seen a lot of people
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.100]   want to kind of use something like an Evernote
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:11.100]   to track their receipts and document them.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.940]   - You would certainly need,
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.640]   I can't imagine how you could do everything with Evernote,
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.080]   but I've been using it more and more.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.080]   And with how good the phone cameras are,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.660]   with how good the text speech recognition is,
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:32.280]   and with how fast the connection is with a phone,
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.080]   the hurdle of entry, of data entry,
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.680]   has gone down so much that I can see,
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.020]   so I have a way, one of my projects at home,
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.240]   I have bins that I use in my garage
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.240]   to store different items.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.520]   I like to use bins and the bins are numbered.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.100]   And one of the cool things is to know what's in them.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.560]   It's super easy for me.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.600]   I lay the items out on a table,
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.360]   snap a picture with my phone,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.040]   and then I just use the speech recognition
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:00.960]   and speak into it.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.600]   And I can say, "Bin number one," for example.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.000]   I have an entire bin filled with electrical cords.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.480]   And so I can say, "Extension cords,"
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.880]   all the different types of cords.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.000]   I can just look at everything on the table.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.560]   I can speak it all into the phone.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.000]   Then I can just, at any time,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.400]   if I'm wondering where's my generator power cord
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.440]   to connect my generator to my house,
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.080]   then I just go into Evernote
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.560]   and I just type generator power cord and it brings it up.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.920]   So one advantage of having everything integrated,
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.120]   of the way Evernote allows you to integrate
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.640]   a picture, speech to text recognition,
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.000]   an audio file, and have everything tagged,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.440]   I could see somebody,
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.920]   and I haven't set this up myself,
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.320]   although I do it a little bit,
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.820]   I can see you snap a picture of the receipt,
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.240]   you hit the speech recognition,
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.760]   you describe, "I had a lunch appointment
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.580]   "with John and Jane Smith today.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.320]   "We talked about their estate plan.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.360]   "We met at Chili's and this was the outcome of it."
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.760]   And for either free or whatever their minimal cost is
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.360]   for the premium version,
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.840]   you can have a system where everything's in one place,
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.880]   and then if you can set up a way to transition that over
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.620]   into your accounting system,
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:12.280]   I could see an intelligent way to design that
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.460]   with all that different input.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.960]   You can even record a voice memo if you need to,
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.080]   or append any, or include and attach your PDF file.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.200]   I don't know, I'll have to look and see
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.560]   if somebody's designed something like that.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.660]   I haven't fully designed it,
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.600]   but I can see how to use it in my head.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.480]   - Oh yeah, I think that's good,
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.080]   especially the voice part,
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.200]   'cause that makes it quicker, easier, and simpler
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.760]   for the business owner that's trying
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.960]   to record all their transactions.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.560]   - The voice part is so good now,
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.420]   and just driving down the road,
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.960]   you basically have a free dictation service on your phone,
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.680]   and you can at least have the notes that you need
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.160]   about what you talked about,
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.600]   and it might lower the friction of actually entering it in
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.800]   and having the documentation that you need.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.520]   - Yep, that's exactly correct.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.920]   And then the last tip that I had here,
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.440]   we've talked a lot about changing your mindset
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.180]   and getting your electronic statements,
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.060]   and getting some sort of software package,
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.200]   whether it's QuickBooks, FreshBooks,
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.200]   or I think it was NewBooks that you said,
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.400]   or NewCash, what was it again?
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.160]   - Right, NewCash, G-N-U-C-A-S-H, NewCash.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.200]   - Yeah, and so now, you just need to get it done, right?
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.720]   We talked about all these ideas,
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.000]   and as a business owner, you just need to get it done.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.420]   And so if you don't have,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.920]   we talked about some on-the-go ideas
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.000]   that I think are helpful and help minimize the time
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.120]   that you need to do your bookkeeping,
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:49.020]   but I always recommend that people set a specific time
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.120]   at a certain interval to review their books
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.960]   and take a step back and say,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.520]   okay, do I have everything here?
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.360]   How's my business doing?
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.960]   What do I have carrying forward?
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.200]   What are my business needs in the next month
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.320]   or quarter or something like that?
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.320]   And so what I found is if you do not set a specific time,
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.600]   what I found that works better is,
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   or the best is either weekly or monthly.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.840]   If you don't set that specific time,
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.400]   the bookkeeping and accounting starts to not get done,
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.120]   and then all of a sudden, you're in January,
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.440]   trying to do your tax return,
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.120]   and you got, of the last year,
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.560]   you have January, February, March done,
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.240]   and then the rest of the year needs a lot of work.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.080]   - Right.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.000]   - And so the point here, basically,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.160]   is to set a time, stick to it, to do your bookkeeping,
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.120]   and it'll help minimize the load
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.220]   at any specific time throughout the year.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.760]   The most, there have been many times
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.880]   over the last six years of my running a business,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.760]   several years, I get to tax time,
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.880]   and I have to sit down, clear my schedule
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.400]   for three or four days, and go back through
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.880]   and reconstruct the records.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.040]   And what finally helped, actually,
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.760]   is I figured out that if I just did a little bit,
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.080]   just about every day,
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.240]   if I kept my checkbook registers up to date,
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.400]   and I would do that, pull open my bank app,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.360]   double check, verify my checkbook registers,
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.320]   everything's reconciled.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.880]   If I did it every day or every other day,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.200]   it took about a minute.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.440]   In the morning, I sit down at my desk,
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   reconcile my checkbook registers.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.360]   And then, if every few days, or at least once a week,
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.200]   I made sure that everything was loaded into my spreadsheet,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.360]   and then, if at least once monthly,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.480]   at the end of the month, I would sit down,
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.560]   and what happened is I would receive
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.680]   my commission checks bi-monthly.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.200]   And so I would make sure to schedule
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.640]   just a half hour to sit down,
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.000]   and every time I received the check,
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:49.840]   bring everything up to date.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.040]   And then, at the end of the month,
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.920]   I would create my monthly P&L to review with my wife.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.120]   And I included on my P&L all of my business,
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.160]   it was a business and a personal P&L.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.700]   I look at them all as integrated,
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.640]   so we could see everything on one page.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.000]   And she is not a numbers person,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.200]   and so she could handle about five,
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.720]   she likes about a five-minute discussion on the numbers.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.080]   But at least I was able to say,
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.680]   here was what our profit margin was last month
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.440]   in our life, look, here's the trend
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.880]   of this category of our spending,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.240]   or this category, here's what we're doing.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.600]   And that kept me on track.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.520]   It's fallen apart the last six months that I left.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.360]   And so now, I'm recreating,
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.000]   yeah, I'm recreating and getting back on track
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.120]   the last couple months to fix my accounting systems,
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.160]   'cause they fall apart without regular care and feeding.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.220]   You gotta set that time to do 'em consistently.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.120]   - Yeah, and from my perspective,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.920]   I have a lot of clients that are emailing me
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.440]   the first two weeks of January,
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.760]   like, hey, what am I gonna need out of pocket in April,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.240]   or what am I gonna be receiving in April?
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.640]   And I can field a lot of those questions pretty quick,
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.200]   because most of my clients,
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.400]   we have a monthly schedule or a quarterly schedule
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.240]   where we're doing everything,
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.560]   and so I can give a pretty dang close estimate
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.560]   the first 15 days of January,
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.920]   where they're gonna end up,
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.400]   as opposed to a lot of people,
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.280]   it takes them into February or even March
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.920]   to try and get that net income number
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920]   from the previous year.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.000]   So keeping up on the bookkeeping
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.800]   and having a set interval definitely has its advantages.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.640]   - Right.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.800]   I wanna ask you about one more thing.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.620]   - Okay.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:31.460]   - Well, actually, two things.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.380]   I wanna ask you first about,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.760]   we talked a lot about tracking income and expenses,
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.080]   but I wanna ask you about balance sheets,
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.000]   'cause that's on our outline.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.520]   And then I wanna ask you for your advice
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.280]   on working with a bookkeeper and/or an accountant
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.440]   and how to effectively do that.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.120]   But we skipped over the balance sheet section.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.260]   Walk us through some tips and reasons
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.200]   why we should be tracking both the balance sheet
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.440]   and the income statement.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.200]   - Okay.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.320]   We talked a lot about tracking income and expenses,
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.480]   and we mentioned a double-sided accounting system.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.880]   And what that double-side accounting system is
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.160]   is you get the one side on the income statement,
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.160]   on the other side, you get a balance sheet.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.360]   And so I've seen a lot of people
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.960]   that completely disregard the balance sheet.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.360]   Even in your personal lives,
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.080]   balance sheet can be important.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.400]   So let's say that you're with someone somewhere
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.920]   and you go ahead and buy dinner for everyone
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.020]   so it's just on one card,
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.000]   and then everyone is supposed to pay you back.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.560]   If you don't have a balance sheet,
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:37.440]   you're not gonna know that these people
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.300]   owe you a certain amount of money,
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:44.200]   and that the entire charge that went on your credit card
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.320]   isn't an actual expense to you.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.960]   Your expense was a lot lower.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.480]   And if people don't know what a balance sheet is,
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.080]   a balance sheet is essentially,
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.760]   it's a report that tracks your assets,
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.960]   liabilities, and equity in your business.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.680]   And so one example I like to talk about
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.840]   that I think gets across to a lot of people
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.560]   is putting it in the perspective of purchasing a home.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.780]   And so for most people,
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.940]   homes are, you can't buy 'em in cash.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.460]   You need some sort of mortgage to,
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.740]   for the average person to be able to get into a home
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.580]   and afford a home.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:23.340]   And so if you're buying a $100,000 house
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.140]   and you're coming with $20,000 down,
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.480]   you're gonna pick up a mortgage for the difference,
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.100]   which is the 80,000.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:32.380]   And so if we're looking at your balance sheet,
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.580]   you're gonna have an asset worth $100,000
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:36.180]   'cause that's what your house is worth
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.560]   and you own that house.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.800]   And then you have a mortgage against it for the 80,
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.360]   so that's your liabilities.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.800]   And then your equity piece
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.640]   is the difference between the two in the house.
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.200]   And so if you turn around,
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.840]   and we're gonna ignore selling expenses and stuff.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.920]   If you turn around and sold that house
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:54.840]   in the next month or two and got your $100,000 back,
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.760]   you're gonna end up with your 20,000.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.520]   And so when you look at the balance sheet,
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.240]   it helps you understand some of those things,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.320]   but oh, I got this big old asset over here for $100,000,
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.340]   but yeah, I don't own all that
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.920]   because I have this mortgage on it,
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.560]   so my equity's a lot lower.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.080]   And in business, it's really important
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.600]   to track some of these things
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.460]   because if you're planning for a purchase,
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.920]   I need to purchase a new computer system
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.600]   or I need to purchase a big old piece of equipment
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.640]   or I need to pay my taxes even in the next month or two,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.680]   and you look at your bank account,
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.400]   and you're like, man, I have 10, 15, $20,000 in there,
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.040]   you're gonna wanna know what sort of liabilities
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.800]   are out there that you're gonna have to pay.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.600]   And so some of them that come up a lot
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.560]   are things like sales tax
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.000]   'cause sales tax, you collect from customers,
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:49.920]   and then you have to turn around
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.980]   and remit it to the government.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:55.100]   But you need to know what you collected
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.840]   so that you can turn around and give it to the government.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.160]   If you don't have a balance sheet
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.480]   where you're just tracking your inflows and outflows
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.080]   from your checking account,
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.160]   you're never gonna, you're not gonna,
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.200]   sometimes you may not even know
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.060]   the sales tax liability's even there.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:14.720]   Another common one is payroll tax liabilities.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.420]   When you, if you have employees and you're paying them,
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.280]   you have payroll withholding
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.960]   that you withhold from their check
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.980]   and then turn around and give to the government.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.360]   If you don't track your balance sheet,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.600]   you're not gonna know exactly what you need to give,
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.800]   what you need to give to the government.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.000]   And then one of the maybe more important things
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.560]   on the balance sheet is accounts receivable.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.720]   So accounts receivable are things
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.020]   that you've sold to customers
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.560]   and then they haven't paid you yet.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.640]   And so it's important to track who owes you what
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.860]   and for which invoice and how long it's been outstanding.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.880]   So there's a lot of these things in the balance sheet
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.520]   that are really important for a business owner
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.960]   to know about that if you are just tracking
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.940]   the income and expense in the checking account,
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.080]   you're never gonna pick up
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.840]   and you're not gonna be able to accurately plan
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.140]   for the needs of your business going forward.
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:13.080]   - It's ultimately also just the balance sheet
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.560]   is what tells you if you're actually
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.240]   holding on to your money.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.280]   One of the things that I find interesting
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.120]   is people often forget about this
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.060]   and often in the online business world,
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.520]   people crow about how much income they have.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.280]   But the balance sheet is what determines
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.760]   what you're actually, it's not what determines your profit,
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.920]   but it shows you what you have.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.880]   And you need both of them.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.980]   I mean, you need all four accounting statements really,
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:43.640]   but the two big ones are gonna be your income statement
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.480]   and your balance sheet.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.360]   And those two, seeing how they work from one to the next
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.920]   and work from one to the next,
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.480]   'cause we talked about it,
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.080]   accounting is the language of business.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.960]   That's what tells you the process
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.600]   and how things are going over time.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.240]   And every business will be unique.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.400]   Some businesses might be cash heavy,
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.120]   and so therefore you see that reflected on the balance sheet.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.200]   Some businesses might be property heavy,
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.640]   and some businesses might just simply be equity heavy,
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.660]   where there's very little cash and you're looking at it,
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.080]   but we've got a massive shareholders equity portion.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.320]   Now, how do we build a plan to get out from that?
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.660]   And all of this is ultimately the information
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.080]   that we need to bring back over
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.800]   into personal financial planning.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.160]   And sometimes you gotta figure out,
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160]   oh, we just got plenty of cash.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.200]   And sometimes, man, we got all this equity,
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.560]   but how do we divest of this equity?
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.920]   Whether it's on the massive scale,
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.800]   that's all an IPO is practically for many,
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.200]   an initial public offering is for many companies.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.940]   It's a way for, the Facebook IPO is a way
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.020]   for Mark Zuckerberg and his friends
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:48.100]   to go from being massive mega billionaires
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.960]   on their balance sheet with shareholders equity
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.520]   to being massive mega billionaires with cash
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.600]   that is not all tied up in the future of the company.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.500]   That's what the purpose of an IPO is,
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.120]   is to allow the owners of the company to cash out.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.640]   But people, I think, often don't understand that
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.500]   'cause they don't understand how the balance sheet works.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:10.280]   - Yeah, that's exactly correct.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.560]   And we've mentioned a lot about, okay,
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.720]   these are important to track,
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.000]   and these are important to know,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.640]   but I guess tips for tracking the balance sheet,
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.700]   the balance sheet's a tough one
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:24.720]   because it's a very meticulous process,
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:27.000]   especially if you have a lot of transactions
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.160]   and you have a lot of different customers.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:33.720]   You almost need one of those accounting softwares
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.360]   to be able to track it in a,
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.340]   putting forth a reasonable effort from yourself
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:43.280]   'cause it could start to be really laborsome.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:48.280]   If you do it manually, you'll need to be able to track,
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.720]   okay, I sold this thing to this customer
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.180]   and they haven't paid me yet,
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.520]   and then when that check comes in,
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.420]   you have to go back and update that
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:01.600]   so that, to show that they don't owe you money anymore.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.520]   But a low transaction company
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.300]   with not a whole lot of either inventory
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.960]   or customers out there for people that they owe,
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.520]   if they just get paid as they either do their service
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.760]   or as the transaction happens,
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.080]   and if you have a lot of your transactions
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.940]   that you put on a credit card,
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.700]   it's easier to do in Excel
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:34.700]   because you can just add up the transactions as they occur
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:37.120]   and then know at the end of the month,
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.000]   okay, here's my credit card balance
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.480]   or here's the sales tax that I collected,
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.840]   and then you'll be able to zero that balance out
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.640]   in your Excel file really quick.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.000]   But I think for most businesses,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.640]   especially if you sell a lot of product
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.140]   and you have a lot of inventory,
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:01.520]   that's where the accounting system
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.720]   really starts to become important
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.320]   'cause for each piece of inventory,
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.160]   you have different amounts that it costs you
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:12.100]   and you have different quantities on hand
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:15.000]   that you're selling and then buying all the time.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.480]   And so the accounting software on the balance sheet
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.880]   really, really helps out.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.160]   - So that brings us perfectly to where I'd like to end up,
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.620]   which is talking about scale.
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.740]   And one of the things that I've tried to emphasize
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.580]   on my show is applying a little bit
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.800]   of formal accounting practice to our personal lives
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.440]   'cause the reality is each of us is,
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.440]   in some ways, an individual business.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.040]   And even if we are earning a salary,
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.760]   I still think it's a useful, if nothing else,
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.160]   a useful mental concept to view ourselves as self-employed
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.360]   and our employer simply happens to be
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.520]   our number one customer at this point in time,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.600]   whether we have one customer, an employer,
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.800]   or whether we have multiple, ranging into our business.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.440]   But accounting systems can and should and do scale.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.420]   So I don't see any particular reason
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.880]   for somebody who's working as a middle school teacher
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.860]   to be using QuickBooks and double-entry accounting
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.200]   to track their financial life.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.560]   All I would be doing in that situation
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.340]   is keeping a checkbook register,
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.040]   taking out some big categories,
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.240]   looking at it purely in rough numbers,
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.920]   and then perhaps every month or every quarter,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.000]   making a note of my balances,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.600]   how much equity I have in my house,
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.380]   what the balances are on my debts,
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.340]   how much are in my accounts,
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.720]   or even just once a year sitting down and comparing,
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.920]   well, January 1, last year I had this amount of net worth,
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.180]   January 1 of this year I have this amount, how am I doing?
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.720]   It should be simple, and it can be done
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:50.340]   completely manually with a pen
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.000]   and without even a calculator,
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.900]   although a calculator can be useful.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:57.140]   Now on the flip side, a business like you mentioned
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:00.260]   with inventory and, I mean, a large business,
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:05.260]   you're gonna need an accounting department,
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.900]   or you're gonna need, sometimes you're gonna need
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.220]   a bookkeeper, sometimes you can't.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.820]   So you've gotta scale this stuff appropriately.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:13.680]   And I think this is one area where I personally struggle with
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.820]   is knowing when and how I should scale my systems up.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.520]   When you feel something's not working
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.660]   and I need to change something.
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.300]   Do you have any advice for how to figure out
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.780]   where you are in that process
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:30.040]   and how to figure out when I should hire
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.300]   a part-time bookkeeper, when I should hire
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.380]   a full-time bookkeeper, when I should scale up
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.600]   to a staff accountant, that type of process?
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:41.840]   - Yeah, so I think it's a pretty simple decision.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.600]   And for me, if I'm an entrepreneur,
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.040]   when I don't have enough time to do this anymore,
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.160]   or I feel like I have a really good grasp on it,
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.160]   and I guess my time is more valuable doing other things,
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.800]   I think that's when you really need to start
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.280]   to think about bringing in someone,
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.920]   whether it's a part-time bookkeeper
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.920]   or someone that runs a bookkeeping business
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.220]   that you can hand your stuff to for them to do
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.420]   each month or each quarter, whatever you do.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.300]   I think that's when you really need to start
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.840]   to bring people in.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.320]   And then, if you're talking about bringing in
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.080]   an actual staff accountant, I think you really need
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.620]   a larger business to do that.
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:33.920]   Because once you start to bring on a full-time employee
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.960]   that's an accountant, they can sometimes
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.720]   start to cost quite a bit.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.520]   And so if you don't have your business scaled up
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:46.520]   and some hard recurring revenue each month,
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:50.400]   each quarter, you maybe not necessarily
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.380]   wanna bring on someone full-time
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:53.920]   to be doing your accounting.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.840]   - Right.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.480]   Do you think, and this is advice that I have read
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.280]   from people that are far ahead of where I am
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.240]   in my entrepreneurial journey,
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:09.920]   but I often read CEOs say there are two things
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.560]   that you never wanna get your hands off of.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.800]   You never wanna outsource completely.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:17.600]   And one of those things is sales and marketing.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.520]   You need to understand, even if you're not doing it,
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.800]   you need to understand what is happening
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.560]   with sales and marketing because that's what drives,
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.320]   that's what gives you the revenue to run your company.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.280]   And number two is the numbers.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.560]   You never wanna take your hands off the numbers
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.080]   'cause you need to start to identify.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.640]   And it's very different to be a CEO
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.800]   of a billion dollar company and you're basically
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:41.160]   sitting with your CFO and just simply looking
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.880]   at these metrics on a regular basis.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.960]   But you need to understand them along the way.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.040]   And I see all of this as part of being good business people
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.120]   is important training.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.220]   And I see it as going back and forth.
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.680]   The training that you need for your personal
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.960]   financial statements translates over to business.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.960]   The training from business should translate
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.720]   over to your personal statements.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.500]   And properly applied will build wealth over time.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.640]   I'll give you the last word.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.360]   - Yeah, and so I would say if your business
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:16.160]   is small enough to where you're working with,
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.400]   either you're doing the bookkeeping
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.180]   or you're working with an outside bookkeeper,
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:23.080]   a lot of the times, even if you outsource all of it,
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.880]   you're not really gonna get your hands off
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.240]   of the financials because there's information
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.960]   that the bookkeeper needs in order to
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.000]   accurately account for various items.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.280]   But if you're really good with the documentation
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.160]   and writing on all the receipts and everything
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.560]   in your checking account, a bookkeeper can do
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.640]   a lot of the work without necessarily having
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.960]   to ask you a bunch of questions.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:52.200]   But at the same time, if you're doing all that,
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.000]   you're probably gonna have a good idea
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000]   of what sorts of things are running through your account
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.280]   and what kind of expenses you have.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.360]   And then if you have a good bookkeeper,
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.160]   they should be providing you with some sort of report,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.640]   either at the end of the month or the end of the quarter,
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.120]   whatever your interval is, and kind of walking you through it
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.960]   and seeing if you have any questions.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.960]   And so you can kind of get back to the numbers that way.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:23.320]   But bookkeeping, I guess to wrap it up
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.160]   with the final word, bookkeeping is important.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.640]   It's the language of business.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.360]   It can be really hard or really simple,
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.520]   depending on the either type of business you have
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.820]   or what systems you set up.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.980]   I'm more of a fan of a simple system.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.640]   It provides a lot of value and gives you more time
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.920]   to be doing other things that probably add a lot of value
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.020]   to your bottom line with the strategy of your business
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.140]   or developing content or whatever you do
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.880]   as an entrepreneur in your business.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.160]   - Any useful resources, particularly valuable books,
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.960]   podcasts, websites, tutorials, guides,
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.080]   that you like to refer to that would be helpful
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.960]   for people that need to enhance their knowledge
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.440]   a little bit?
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.200]   - Yeah, so that's, YouTube is probably the best resource
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.080]   out there for basic, either for basic knowledge
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.360]   if you're just starting out learning
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.760]   or even to get some more detailed knowledge
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.760]   if you know quite a bit.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.000]   A lot of the stuff out, I haven't found a good podcast
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.500]   that talks about these things.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:32.620]   And a lot of the, if you can call it a blog
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:37.620]   or writing out there is more applicable
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:42.120]   to either the practitioner that needs a lot
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:47.120]   of detailed information or just really basic stuff
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.600]   that almost tries to leave it without giving you information
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.740]   as a sales pitch.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:58.360]   But I've noticed YouTube is very helpful for tutorials
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.040]   on how to use QuickBooks, how to use FreshBooks.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.880]   If you have a certain issue that you have
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.200]   in your transaction, you can Google the question
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.000]   in YouTube and probably someone's made a video about it.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.400]   But I would point people towards YouTube
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.240]   if they're getting started with bookkeeping
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.800]   or trying to increase their knowledge.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.500]   - Sounds like you need to create the website
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.040]   and the podcast and the resource for people.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.080]   So get busy, Ryan.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.760]   - Yeah, well, I just, I know you did a few podcasts on it.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.240]   I did my goal setting and some things back
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.360]   at the end of December, early January.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.040]   And more of an online presence in some
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.000]   of those materials is on that list.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.280]   So through 15 and into 16,
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.360]   I'm hoping to get some stuff out there.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.200]   - Well, keep us in the loop
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.240]   and we'll help you publicize your info.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.780]   Ryan, thank you for coming on and for the information.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.000]   Super valuable.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.940]   I know that probably for many people can seem a little dry
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.760]   to go through these things, but it's important.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.540]   And this is the level of knowledge.
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.940]   And even though this is in many ways
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:01.960]   an introductory discussion,
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.700]   these are the factors that drive wealth.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:09.420]   And if you want to become wealthy and stay wealthy,
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.420]   this is the information that's needed.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.360]   And you at least need to be aware of it
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.500]   so that you can make sure things are being done properly.
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:16.980]   So thank you for making the time to come on
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:19.280]   and getting up so early to do this interview.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.960]   - It's my pleasure.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.780]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.060]   (electronic whirring)
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:28.060]   - Now you have to get busy and implement the system.
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.400]   It's one thing to learn about it, one thing to listen,
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.940]   but now you got to get busy and actually do.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.200]   So hopefully you've got enough instructions.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.400]   I'm going to post in the show notes today
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.420]   kind of the detailed outline for our conversation,
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:43.860]   the topics that we walked through and that we discussed.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.100]   You can see the, it's basically the outline
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:49.460]   that Ryan was working from through the call.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.820]   And then, you know, thinking about,
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.420]   I might have him back in the future.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:54.540]   So if you've got tax questions or things like that,
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.280]   I'd love to set up a kind of a stable of experts
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.380]   who can contribute when questions are a little bit beyond
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:03.740]   what I'm ready to answer myself,
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.280]   or at least to feel confident in my answer.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.500]   So hopefully maybe we'll hear from Ryan
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:10.100]   and I'll work to get some other experts on the show as well.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:10.980]   That's it for today's show.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.580]   I thank you all so much for listening.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.860]   It's been a busy week for me.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.100]   I am, I've removed the membership program from the website.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.380]   You'll see that is gone.
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:21.600]   Irregulars, I will be in touch with you soon
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.400]   with details and information on what I'm doing.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.460]   You'll get it first.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.740]   I'm in the process of working on a Patreon page.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:27.700]   So that'll be ready to launch,
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.460]   hopefully in the next couple of days.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.720]   If I can get it out tomorrow, I'll do that.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.740]   If I can get it out Thursday,
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:33.140]   it's just a matter of getting it done,
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:34.420]   which is always a challenge.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.700]   But I'm working hard on it.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.320]   I'm going to, I've figured out,
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.260]   I made a bit of a misstep when I set up
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.260]   the membership program.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.320]   And so I figured out how to do it a little bit better.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.500]   And I feel good about the direction that I'm going in.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:48.540]   So hopefully, stay tuned for that.
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:50.200]   I want to have a great big launch.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.520]   But I feel confident in the direction
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.920]   that I'm taking the show.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:53.960]   I'm learning.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.440]   We're all learning together.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.320]   Sharing with one another and enjoying the sharing economy
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.680]   where we can gain as we go through life.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.320]   But thank you all so much for your support.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.580]   I would normally tell you something
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:05.540]   about the membership program, but today I won't.
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.600]   I'll just simply say thank you for your support.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:11.240]   And I will ask you as we go to do two things for me.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.640]   Number one, if you've never told anybody about the show,
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.160]   would you mind telling somebody?
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.800]   That is the most effective form of advertising
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.440]   that I have is for you telling somebody about the show.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.160]   So if there's somebody that you know
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.840]   who you like would like to help with money
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.320]   or you have a specific topic, would you let them know?
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.320]   I would sure appreciate that.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.080]   Number two, if you would make sure
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.600]   that you're subscribed on iTunes or Stitcher,
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.320]   or I've got a brand new app coming any day.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.040]   It's supposed to be done by now.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.600]   But also make sure to leave a review in iTunes.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.960]   If you haven't done that yet, that would sure be helpful.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:44.920]   That matters, and that helps in the iTunes rankings,
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:47.160]   which helps people find the show organically.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.280]   That's it, I'm out of here.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.040]   Thank you all so much, have a great day.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.620]   (upbeat music)

[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.740]   This show is intended to provide entertainment,
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:25.520]   education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:27.320]   But your situation is unique,
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.040]   and I cannot deliver any actionable advice
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.240]   without knowing anything about you.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.680]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.920]   who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy,
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.240]   and consult them, because they are the ones
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.160]   who can understand your specific needs,
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.240]   your specific goals, and provide
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.220]   specific answers to your questions.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.280]   I've done my absolute best to be clear
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.400]   and accurate in today's show,
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:01.000]   but I'm one person, and I make mistakes.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.280]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:06.720]   please help me by coming to the show page and commenting,
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.880]   so we can all learn together.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:11.440]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
