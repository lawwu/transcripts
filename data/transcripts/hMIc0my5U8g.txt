[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   young people are getting sicker earlier and staying sicker and older people are getting sick
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.180]   but holding on to some remnants of health longer and most of the treatments are geared toward the
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.680]   older population is that true yeah that's true that's exactly right that's a terrible situation
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.860]   because it essentially is not preparing for the future right so what we have is a system as a sick
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.320]   care system the advances we've made have allowed people to say sick longer it hasn't translated a
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   longer life right it just it's there was a hope I think when I first started doing research in 2001
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.940]   there in population aging there was this idea of a compression of morbidity that is you live long a
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.740]   long life and the time you spent really sick and disabled was was compressed at the very end of
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.480]   your life rather than spending a long time disabled and sick and you you you die die after having
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.460]   spending like a decade or more very sick the idea was that that that we're uh which we have advances
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.500]   in our culture has produced results so that you uh you live a long life and you only spend you know a
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.920]   few months really sick at the end of your life um that hasn't panned out right that is in fact we have
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   uh uh very little increase in life expectancy and for many many people unfortunately a very long period
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.140]   of time in in a in a state where they're uh their the quality of life is not that high not that good
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.920]   right dementia uh chronic disease leading to uh you know say diabetes leading to all kinds of of you
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.660]   know kidney failure macular degeneration you you name it peripheral peripheral vascular disease heart disease
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.560]   um you end up with a situation where all of these amazing biomedical advances that we've had over the
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.460]   last decades have not translated to actually improving the health and well-being and longevity of the
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.620]   american people um i think that uh that the biomedical infrastructure research infrastructure of the
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.560]   country has to translate over for results for regular for real for real people for the american people
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   otherwise people can ask us what why why are we having these why why are we doing what we're doing
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.920]   it can't just be that we we're doing cool things i mean not that we're not doing cool things a lot of
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.800]   cool things are getting done but if they don't somehow eventually translate over uh i don't again i don't
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.120]   mean to distinguish basic science work i think basic science work is really important but eventually
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.360]   it has to translate over or else people will say why have we made these vast investments the key
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.120]   the key thing is um if we're not actually improving health as a result of the research we do then we
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.720]   haven't accomplished our mission right that's the and um the research agenda of the nih as we've talked
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.600]   about it's very it's like we talked about uh you know international relations as determining in part what
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.200]   scientists work on it you know for drug pricing um we talked about how politics determines the
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   the agenda that scientists work on right so you talked about hiv right so the the political
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.960]   focus on hiv led to the vast investments the nih has made in hiv with some positive effect actually a
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   lot of positive effect um and then also the sociology professions the scientific profession
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.480]   determining these are all complicated things that result in the portfolio but if the portfolio
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   ultimately doesn't meet the health needs of the american people then it's not doing what it's
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920]   supposed to be doing part of my job is to make sure that that it does meet those health needs the
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.520]   the make america healthy again movement um that's what it's asking for that the health institutions
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.280]   of this country actually meet the health needs of the people where they are uh and um in the large
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.960]   part we've not successfully done that in this country for decades uh otherwise we wouldn't have
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.200]   this major major chronic disease crisis we're currently facing um and so that's you know it's a complicated
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.240]   question it's not like you know it's not just solved by funding one grant or making the specific decisions
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.720]   it's about the incentive the system at large to focus on on on it uh and in uh on on uh on to create
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.480]   incentives to for the so that scientists turn their ingenuity toward those health needs rather than
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:21.840]   rather than just advancing their careers incrementally
