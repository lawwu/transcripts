[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   In the ninth chapter of the Gospel of John, we read a remarkable story of a man born blind,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.480]   made to see by the miraculous healing power of Christ.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.000]   It was the kind of miracle, like so many of them, that could not be kept a secret.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.040]   Word spread far and wide of what Jesus had done to this young man, but the power players
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.840]   of the day rejected the news.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.640]   And so we read that "the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.960]   sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.720]   'Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.200]   How then does he see?'
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.280]   His parents answered, 'We know that this is our son and that he was born blind, but how
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.480]   Ask him, he is of age.'"
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600]   That is, he's at least 13 years old.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.960]   "He will speak for himself.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.920]   His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.360]   agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   synagogue."
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.760]   So, there's a power move here, an intimidation factor at play.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.120]   John continues, "Therefore his parents said, 'He is of age, ask him.'
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.600]   So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, 'Give
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   glory to God.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.240]   We know that this man is a sinner.'
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.080]   He the healed man answered, 'Whether he is a sinner I do not know.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.'"
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.320]   John 9, 18-25.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   Was blind, but now I see.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.920]   That famous line worked into John Newton's famous hymn, Amazing Grace.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920]   It's such a great statement.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.880]   John 9, this whole chapter is a key in explaining God's plan for physical disability, but it's
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.280]   also a key chapter for understanding how we as Christians, changed by the grace of God,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.240]   can testify of Christ before the world's most powerful and educated people.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.640]   Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.520]   Conversation number four, verses 24-34.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.000]   This is the longest one.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   And here we see the full-blown courage of a beggar, a mere beggar, standing up to the
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   most religious, most educated people of the land.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.680]   And we see here full-blown blasphemy in response to that kind of courage.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.080]   So verse 24, "Give glory to God.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.600]   We know this man is a sinner, so join us in blasphemy, or we'll excommunicate you out
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.880]   of the synagogue."
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   That's not like being excommunicated out of Bethlehem.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   Do you know what happens if we do discipline on an unrepentant person?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.360]   They go join another church, in spite of any letter we might send.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.520]   There are churches of all kinds, just move on.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.840]   That can't happen here.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.000]   When you get kicked out of a synagogue, you get kicked out of Judaism.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   This is life.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.960]   It's like you, you're a Muslim, everybody's a Muslim.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.120]   You can't be here as a Christian.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.640]   It won't work.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   This is huge.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   Don't, don't here, we'll kick you out.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   We will get rid of you from the synagogue.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.840]   That means you're out of the community.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.880]   This is huge.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.000]   What this man was standing up against.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.160]   He says, and this is his most famous sentence.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   People all over the world know this sentence, even if they don't know the Bible.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.240]   Verse 20, it's still 24.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.520]   Whether he's a sinner or I don't know.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.720]   One thing I know, though I was blind.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.040]   Now I see.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.440]   I hope you feel something here.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.720]   You don't think of yourself as a theologian.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.680]   You don't think of yourself as a scientist.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.760]   When you got people coming against your faith with every manner of argument, historically,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.440]   scientifically, experientially is coming against you.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.040]   If you try to be a bold, regular witness, and I want you to feel the power of this,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   a personal testimony, Trump's arguments when they're bad arguments and they're all bad
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.600]   arguments when they're against Jesus.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   Don't be intimidated.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.640]   This man was way less educated than everybody in all these rooms.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   And he'd been blind all of his life.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.840]   And he just simply said, with all boldness, look, you may know some things I don't know,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   but I can see.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   And one of the reasons I teach and preach on the doctrines of grace is because there's
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.920]   so many Christians who don't know how they got saved so that they don't know they have
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.160]   a stunning testimony that they sheer believe.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.240]   Your belief is a miracle.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.720]   You didn't choose it.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:31.760]   Of course, if you have a theology that says I did it, you've got no testimony to the power
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.800]   of God in your life.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:43.080]   But if you believe that at age six or 16 or 36, when you saw Jesus as needed and beautiful
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.440]   and sufficient, and you confessed, I'm a sinner, I need you, I receive you, a miracle happened.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.560]   A miracle happened.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.780]   That's why these theological things matter.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.860]   You can stand up in the front of the Senate and say, I don't know much about what you
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860]   guys deal with here.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.600]   I just know one thing, I was blind once and now I see the glory of Christ as self-evidencing
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.120]   and compelling and I will die for him.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.280]   I'll stake my life on the truth of what I've seen in Jesus.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.840]   That's what you can say.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   That's very powerful.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.080]   It is here.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.360]   It will come to a point where they can't handle him anymore.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.160]   So that's what he said.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.520]   I hope you're willing to say it.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.600]   I hope you have enough understanding to say it.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.920]   And if you don't, I hope you study about how you got saved so that you will know if you're
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.400]   saved, you can say it.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.980]   His courage becomes scorn.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.200]   Verse 27.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Why do you want to hear my story again?
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.280]   You want to become his disciples?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.800]   Whoa.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.000]   What are you doing, man?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.500]   Get yourself killed.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.580]   They're very hostile.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.520]   Of course, verse 28, they reviled him saying you are his disciple, but we are disciples
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.320]   of Moses.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.120]   We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we don't know where he comes
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.720]   from.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.400]   Now the controversy has revealed another deceit.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.660]   They're not disciples of Moses.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.840]   They think they are.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.200]   They're not.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   Because Jesus said in John 5 46, if you believed Moses, you would believe me for he wrote of
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.920]   me.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   You don't know Moses and you don't know God.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.600]   You talk about Moses.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.880]   You read Moses.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.400]   You talk about God.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   You read God's word and you don't know God because if you knew God and you knew Moses,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.680]   you know me.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.720]   So again, the controversy is revealing what's really going on in here.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.200]   And now we are seeing who's really blind here.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:26.520]   They take the first five books of their Bible and they do this and they don't see anything.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.120]   They're blind.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.640]   So we're watching a man whose sight is becoming clearer and clearer and clearer and courage
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.760]   is becoming stronger and stronger and we're watching these Pharisees reveal more and more
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.300]   blindness.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.360]   You don't want to be a part of that.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   Verses number five, verses 35 to 38 between Jesus and the beggar after they cast him out.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:02.440]   And what makes this conversation so amazingly significant or one of the things that does
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.680]   is that Jesus sought him out and found him.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:17.480]   This man, verse 34, you were born in utter sin and would you teach us and they cast him
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   out.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.200]   Now that's, as I said, really serious.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.600]   To whom will he turn when he's just been cast out of the community?
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.900]   To whom will he turn?
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.940]   He doesn't have to turn anywhere.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.160]   Jesus turns to him.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.720]   We've seen this before, haven't we?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.440]   Jesus found him.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.160]   Jesus seeks him.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.960]   And here's what they say, verse 35, Jesus heard that they had cast him out and having
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.720]   found him, so I'm going to put in a little princess here.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.880]   It is no accident that the next chapter is about the good shepherd who gathers his sheep.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.800]   It's no accident.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.280]   Everyone knows what he's doing.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.880]   He found him.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.320]   That's one of mine.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.720]   Nobody else wants him right now.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.400]   I want him.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.360]   And that's what I'm praying he'll do to you in the next five minutes of this sermon.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   He's after you.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.920]   He's going to find you.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's why you're here.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.220]   It's why you're there.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.240]   Jesus heard that they cast him out and he found him.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.280]   He found him, he said, do you believe in the son of man?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.440]   He answered, and who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:47.640]   And Jesus said to him, you have seen him and it is he who is speaking to you.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.320]   And he said, Lord, I believe.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.200]   And he worshipped.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.840]   So the last thing we see him doing, he's gone out of this story.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.960]   He never says another word.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   We never see him again.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.800]   The last thing he does is worship Jesus.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.200]   I pray that's the last thing I do.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.840]   Jesus does the works of God.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.400]   Jesus is the glory of God.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.760]   Jesus is to be worshipped.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.880]   That's the point of the story.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.680]   He's blind.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.040]   He calls Jesus a man.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.120]   Then he calls Jesus a prophet.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.680]   Then he defends him at huge risk to his life.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.560]   And then he worships him after he is found by Jesus.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.000]   Jesus came into the world to seek worshippers.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.400]   That's why he's here.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:49.720]   Do you confess him openly and defend him with your simple testimony?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.160]   No big apologetic reasoning.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.720]   Some of you are called to that, but most of you aren't.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.960]   You're just called to be witnesses.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.760]   You see a car, hit a person, you can be a witness.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.240]   You don't need any education at all.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   I saw.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   95% of Christians are saved that way.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   No big argument.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   Just I saw.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.080]   Finally, I saw.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.920]   I was reading my gospels and I couldn't resist this man anymore.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.560]   He was real.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   He's real.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   He's true.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   He's exactly what I need.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   He's what the world needs.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   He's real.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.600]   He's not made up.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.560]   You saw.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:34.800]   And so I simply ask, do you confess him openly and defend him with your simple testimony?
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.120]   I was blind and now I see.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   Powerful.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.600]   This is from the sermon titled The Works of God and the Worship of Jesus preached on John
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.480]   9 verses 1 to 39, preached on June 4th, 2011.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.600]   You can find the whole thing at DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   Francis sent the clip into us.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.080]   Dear Pastor John, I've been listening to your sermons on the gospel of John and have
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.960]   been deeply blessed by them, he writes us.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.980]   I am so thankful for the way you, through the power of the Holy Spirit, have made the
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.360]   glory of God in these texts so clear and powerful and drawing.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.160]   Of all your sermons on John, this clip is at the top, and through it I have found strength
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.680]   and courage to be bold and sure about my faith in Jesus.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.680]   Amen.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.600]   Francis, thanks for sending it in.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   And thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.800]   All our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life and we share that clip with the
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   ABJ audience.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.360]   If you got one, email me.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.800]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.600]   the audio and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.840]   Put the word "clip" in a subject line of an email and send it to us at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   That's our email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.880]   Hashtag blessed.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.720]   It's a social media tag for when someone feels blessed and who has or is getting everything
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   they dreamed of.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.520]   It can range from getting a new girlfriend, a new job, a pay raise, finding a $10 bill
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.960]   on the sidewalk, or getting surprisingly good news.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.920]   But what does it mean to be truly blessed according to Scripture?
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.960]   Now, that's a very different discussion, one initiated by a discerning listener to
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   the podcast.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   That's up next time.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.480]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.040]   We'll see you then.
