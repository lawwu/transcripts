[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   Old Banzar, grim warrior of another day,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   stood guard at the passageway leading to the top of the ancient walls of Babylon.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   Up above, valiant defenders were battling to hold the walls.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.800]   Upon them depended the future existence of this great city with its hundreds of thousands of citizens.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.200]   Over the walls came the roar of the attacking armies,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.800]   the yelling of many men, the trampling of thousands of horses,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   the deafening boom of the battering rams pounding the bronzed gates.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.600]   In the street behind the gate lounged the spearmen,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.000]   waiting to defend the entrance should the gates give way.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.400]   They were but few for the task.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000]   The main armies of Babylon were with their king,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.800]   far away in the east on the great expedition against the Elamites.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.200]   No attack upon the city having been anticipated during their absence,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.000]   the defending forces were small.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.400]   Unexpectedly, from the north bore down the mighty armies of the Assyrians.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.800]   And now the walls must hold, or Babylon was doomed.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.000]   About Banzar were great crowds of citizens,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   white-faced and terrified, eagerly seeking news of the battle.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400]   With hushed awe they viewed the stream of wounded and dead
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   being carried or led out of the passageway.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   Here was the crucial point of the attack.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.200]   After three days of circling about the city, the enemy had suddenly thrown
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.800]   his great strength against this section and this gate.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   The defenders from the top of the wall fought off the climbing platforms
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.600]   and the scaling ladders of the attackers with arrows,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.400]   burning oil and, if any reached the top, spears.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.200]   Against the defenders, thousands of the enemy's archers poured a deadly barrage of arrows.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000]   Old Banzar had the vantage point for news.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   He was closest to the conflict and first to hear of each fresh repulse
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   of the frenzied attackers.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.000]   An elderly merchant crowded close to him, his palsied hands quivering.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   "Tell me, tell me," he pleaded.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   "They cannot get in. My sons are with the good king.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.400]   There is no one to protect my old wife. My goods, they will steal all.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.600]   My food, they will leave nothing. We are old, too old to defend ourselves,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.800]   too old for slaves. We shall starve. We shall die. Tell me they cannot get in."
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.600]   "Calm thyself, good merchant," the guard responded.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.800]   "The walls of Babylon are strong. Go back to the bazaar and tell your wife
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.200]   that the walls will protect you and all of your possessions
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   as safely as they protect the rich treasures of the king.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.800]   Keep close to the walls lest the arrows flying over strike you."
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.600]   A woman with a babe in arms took the old man's place as he withdrew.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.800]   "Sergeant, what news from the top? Tell me truly that I may reassure my poor husband.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   He lies with fever from his terrible wounds, yet insists upon his armor and his spear
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600]   to protect me, who am with child.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.200]   Terrible, he says, will be the vengeful lust of our enemies should they break in."
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   "Be thou of good heart, thou mother that is, and is again to be.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.600]   The walls of Babylon will protect you and your babes.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.000]   They are high and strong. Hear ye not the yells of our valiant defenders
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.600]   as they empty the cauldrons of burning oil upon the ladder scalers?"
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   "Yes, that do I hear, and also the roar of the battering rams that do hammer at our gates."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.600]   "Back to thy husband. Tell him the gates are strong and withstand the rams.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.400]   Also, that the scalers climb the walls but to receive the waiting spear thrust.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.000]   Watch thy way, and hasten behind yon buildings."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   Banzar stepped aside to clear the passage for heavily armed reinforcements.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   As with clanking bronze shields and heavy tread they tramped by,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.200]   a small girl plucked at his girdle.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.600]   "Tell me, please, soldier, are we safe?" she pleaded.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   "I hear the awful noises. I see the men all bleeding.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.800]   I am so frightened. What will become of our family?
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Of my mother, little brother, and the baby?"
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.400]   The grim old campaigner blinked his eyes and thrust forward his chin as he beheld the child.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   "Be not afraid, little one," he reassured her.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   "The walls of Babylon will protect you and mother and little brother and the baby.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.000]   It was for the safety of such as you that the good queen Semiramis built them over a hundred years ago.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.400]   Never have they been broken through.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.000]   Go back and tell your mother and little brother and the baby that the walls of Babylon will protect them,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.400]   and they need have no fear."
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   Day after day old Banzar stood at his post and watched the reinforcements file up the passageway.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.800]   There to stay and fight until wounded or dead they came down once more.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.400]   Around him unceasingly crowded the throngs of frightened citizens eagerly seeking to learn if the walls would hold.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   To all he gave his answer with the fine dignity of an old soldier,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   "The walls of Babylon will protect you."
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.000]   For three weeks and five days the attack waged with scarcely ceasing violence.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.200]   Harder and grimmer set the jaw of Banzar as the passage behind,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.400]   wet with the blood of the many wounded, was churned into mud
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.200]   by the never ceasing streams of men passing up and staggering down.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.000]   Each day the slaughtered attackers piled up in heaps before the wall.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   Each night they were carried back and buried by their comrades.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   Upon the fifth night of the fourth week the clamor without diminished.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   The first streaks of daylight illuminating the plains disclosed great clouds of dust raised by the retreating armies.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   A mighty shout went up from the defenders.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   There was no mistaking its meaning.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.000]   It was repeated by the waiting troops behind the wall.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.200]   It was echoed by the citizens upon the streets.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.400]   It swept over the city with the violence of a storm.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   People rushed from the houses.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.800]   The streets were jammed with a throbbing mob.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.400]   The pent-up fear of weeks found an outlet in the wild chorus of joy.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.200]   From the top of the high tower of the Temple of Bell burst forth the flames of victory.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.600]   Skyward floated the column of blue smoke to carry the message far and wide.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   The walls of Babylon had once again repulsed a mighty and vicious foe determined to loot her rich treasures and to ravish and enslave her citizens.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Babylon endured century after century because it was fully protected.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.000]   It could not afford to be otherwise.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.800]   The walls of Babylon were an outstanding example of man's need and desire for protection.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.600]   This desire is inherent in the human race.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   It is just as strong today as it ever was, but we have developed broader and better plans to accomplish the same purpose.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   In this day, behind the impregnable walls of insurance, savings accounts, and dependable investments,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   we can guard ourselves against the unexpected tragedies that may enter any door and seat themselves before any fireside.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   We cannot afford to be without adequate protection.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions old and new.
