[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, let's move on to some questions about deep work.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.100]   Our first question comes from Jamie.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.900]   Jamie says, "If you work a 9-to-5 job
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.500]   and would like to study part-time for postgraduate studies,
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300]   what time management strategies would you suggest
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.400]   or type of planning would you do,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.200]   as well as what techniques would you use
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.100]   to learn the information faster?"
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.400]   Well, Jamie, if you're going to do academic work
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.800]   and you have time constraints, like you have here,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300]   you have a 9-to-5 job and you have to fit this around,
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800]   deploying a strategy that I call the student workday
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.600]   is probably going to be particularly important.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.800]   Now, this is an idea that I used to expound
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.000]   back in the early days of my blog
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   when I was talking primarily to students
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.800]   who had busy schedules.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000]   And the idea behind the student workday
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   was to look at the classes you were taking
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.100]   and then identify,
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.000]   what is the work that I know has to happen
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   on a repeated basis?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.700]   Is it a reading assignments
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.000]   that have to get done every week,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.700]   a lab report that has to get written up every two weeks,
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400]   a problem set that has to be solved weekly,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.200]   or whatever it is?
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.300]   Figure out the work that you know happens repeatedly
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.100]   and answer the question of,
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.400]   when am I going to do that work?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   Same time, same days, every week.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500]   You actually put that on your calendar,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.900]   just like you have your dentist appointment
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.400]   or meeting a friend for drinks.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.500]   You have to figure this out.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.200]   You work a 9-to-5 job,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.600]   so you might not have a lot of options,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.700]   but the work has to get done.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200]   So identify where that work is going to happen.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.400]   Maybe you have an 8am to 9am block
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800]   on a day that you work from home
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900]   and that's when you do the first draft of your problem set
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.300]   and you do that on Mondays.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.700]   And then after dinner,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.000]   you do a 6-to-7.30 block to finish off that problem set.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.100]   Maybe you take 90 minutes out of the middle of the days
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.900]   on Wednesday to do your reading assignments,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.000]   because again, maybe you have some flexibility
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   and you can find that time
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.000]   and there's a conference room in your office
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.300]   that you can go to that's quiet
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.600]   and a good place to do that work.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   But you figure out,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   this is all the work that has to get done on a regular basis.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.200]   This is when I do it, this time, this day.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.300]   I don't have to think about it.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's routine.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.800]   Advanced tip here,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.500]   throw in where that work happens.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.300]   Okay, as long as I'm fixing when it happens,
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.400]   why don't I also throw in where?
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.700]   So that I can find locations
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.600]   I associate just with that work
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800]   and it leads to me shifting into a deep work mode quicker.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.600]   So I go to this library to do this work.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.500]   I have a home office in my basement for that work.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.200]   You want that ritual and routine surrounding this work.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.600]   What I'm trying to do for you here, Jamie,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.200]   is get rid of any on-the-fly decision-making
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.100]   about what should I do today?
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.900]   What's due soon?
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.100]   That's what's going to get you in trouble.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.700]   If you just fly by the seat of your pants
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.500]   and say, "Oh man, I got something due tomorrow
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.400]   and I was at work and I went to dinner
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.700]   and I went to the gym and it's eight
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.200]   and it's going to take four hours."
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.900]   That's where you get into trouble.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.900]   So find when and where that work is going to happen,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.100]   fix on your calendar, stop thinking about scheduling.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.900]   Now, what happens if you can't fit it?
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300]   It's just not reasonable.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.600]   You're taking up every evening
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.800]   and it's taking up all your hours
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100]   and you have no give, you have no time for exercise,
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.200]   you have no time for dinner.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.100]   Well, now you are facing that productivity dragon.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.900]   This is the reality.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.600]   I don't have time.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.100]   If you don't have time, you have to see you don't have time.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   This happens more than you would think.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   There's a semi-famous to me,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.300]   I'll say important to me blog post I wrote years ago.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.400]   It must have been like 2008, maybe even 2007
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.100]   and it was about a student I was advising at MIT.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.800]   She didn't work a nine-to-five job,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.300]   but the number of activities that she was involved with
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.100]   might as well been a nine-to-five job.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.300]   We went through this exercise.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.900]   What's everything you need to do on a regular basis?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.800]   Let's find time for it on the calendar
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.300]   and we couldn't fit it.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900]   We ran out of room.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.800]   And I said to her, her name was Lena,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.900]   "Lena, you obviously are doing too much.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.200]   I'm looking at this calendar.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   We cannot actually fit the work.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   The work is the work.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   We can't fit it in.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   We made it as efficient as possible.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.500]   We can't fit it in."
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.100]   But she couldn't bear say no,
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100]   she couldn't sit and bear say no to things.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.500]   She couldn't take things off of her plate.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.300]   The next semester she had to go on leave for mental health.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.200]   It just completely overwhelmed her.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.000]   So I always say you got to face the productivity dragon here.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.900]   When am I going to do it?
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.800]   If you have time, good.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.600]   And if you don't, you might want to rethink this plan.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.300]   Only then, once you know when this work is going to happen
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.200]   and where it's going to happen
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.800]   and it all fits nicely into your schedule
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   and you're not thinking about scheduling
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.500]   and you're not making decisions on the fly,
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.800]   you're not staying up late all night
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.200]   because you forgot about your problem set
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.500]   until late the night before.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.900]   Once you've done all that,
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.600]   then care about your study habits themselves.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.700]   You want to make these blocks as small as possible
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.800]   while still getting the work done well.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.500]   That comes down to how you study.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.300]   I would recommend my book,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.300]   How to Become a Straight-A Student,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.400]   for a deep dive on how the most efficient students
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.900]   get their work done.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.700]   I will just give you two very brief hints
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.200]   about what you're going to find in there.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.900]   Hint number one,
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.100]   your work accomplished as a student
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.500]   is the product of the time you spend
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.800]   and the intensity of your focus.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   So if you are trying to do your schoolwork
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.700]   with a low intensity of focus,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.200]   i.e. you're looking at your phone,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.100]   you're looking at email,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.900]   you're looking at Slack,
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.600]   you have the TV in the background,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.200]   it's going to take a lot more time in that equation
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.700]   to get the same amount of work done
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.500]   versus if when you work,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.400]   you're 100% focused,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.300]   that intensity of focus is maxed out,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.200]   the time required to get the work done
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.000]   is going to go down.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500]   You need to hack that equation
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.800]   if you're going to get this work done
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   with a nine to five job.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   Two,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.700]   banish the word study from your vocabulary.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.200]   That's way too vague.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.600]   That's way too emotional.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.700]   You got to be instead incredibly specific
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.300]   for this type of work.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.900]   How am I going to do it?
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   And what evidence do I have
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.200]   that this is the right way to do it?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.300]   How to become a straight-A student
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.500]   will get you all those details.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.600]   It'll walk you down that path,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.800]   but those are the big picture summaries
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.600]   of what you might find.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.500]   All right, so summary,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.900]   schedule all your work in advance.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.200]   You know when it's going to happen
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.100]   and then two,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.200]   get very serious about your work habits
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.500]   once that time set aside.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.900]   That's your best bet to succeed
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.600]   with studies,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.300]   with a full-time job,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.000]   without making your life
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   into a joyless grind.
