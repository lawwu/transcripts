[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   What's up everybody, I appreciate you guys tuning in to season one of Curious Mike.
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.900]   Right now we're doing a bonus episode where you guys get to be curious and ask me questions.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.840]   So let's get it going.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.860]   So for this bonus episode, we had you guys comment on an Instagram post, questions you
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.220]   wanted to ask me.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.220]   And so that's what we're going to do right now.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220]   I'm going to answer y'all's questions.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580]   I'm going to have my sister ask them to me.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.480]   I haven't seen any of them, so let's get it going.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   Let's get it going.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   Okay.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480]   So it's 204.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.400]   We're not going to get through all of them, but we will start with something easy.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.560]   Okay.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.100]   How has Denver helped you develop and grow not only as a Hooper, but as an individual?
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.180]   Yeah, I mean, I think when I first got drafted to Denver, I had never even visited Denver
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.220]   and I didn't really know what to expect.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.900]   But then going out there, it was like, I fell in love with the city instantly.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.140]   The people are so down to earth.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900]   You know, it's a very healthy culture.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.600]   I've met tons of great people.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.140]   So off the court, it's been really just relaxing for me.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.340]   It's a chill city, but you can still have fun.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.140]   And then on the court, I mean, we got one of the best young teams in the league.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380]   I'm surrounded by a group of great dudes.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.780]   I think one thing that makes our team unique is just how selfless we are as a team.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.700]   Like everyone wants to see each other succeed.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.960]   And that's really refreshing to be on a team like that, because you hear stories of guys
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.740]   that used to play on other teams coming to Denver, and it didn't used to be like that.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.100]   So it's definitely a blessing to be on a team like that.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.540]   For sure.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.580]   Okay.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.540]   What are your season superstitions or pregame rituals?
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.380]   Yeah, I don't really have too many superstitions.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.900]   I think a lot of players ask me about what separates NBA players from other players.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.020]   And I think one thing is just the routine.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.340]   So I don't have any superstitions, but I do have a routine that I stick to very closely
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.700]   before games.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420]   That just includes all my pregame lifts, my pregame stretching.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.460]   I try to eat similar things every game day.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.820]   And then before I go out on the court, I always say like a prayer, and I try to read some
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.420]   scripture of the Bible just to calm my nerves and help me realize what's really important
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.580]   before I go out to play a game.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.380]   Because you can get in the thought process of how important the game is, but there's
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.840]   way more important things going on.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.140]   So when I can refocus my thinking, it just lets me go out there and play free and not
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.100]   worry too much about the outcome, just be in the moment.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   That's good.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.620]   I feel like you can tell the games where you're really playing free and just...
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620]   I mean, I think it's...
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580]   Some players, when they are really, really just locked in, thinking a lot, play their
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580]   best.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.220]   But for me, when I'm playing free, just letting instinct take over, and just being myself,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.700]   then that's when I have my by-far the best game.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.380]   When I'm in my head or whatever, it's definitely not as free-flowing.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.380]   Okay.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.780]   This is actually a really good question.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.540]   What was it like having to sit out basically your whole college season, and what type of
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.060]   toll did it take on your mental health?
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.100]   This is something that a lot of people, they do know, but they don't really know the extent
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.860]   of it.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.500]   That was definitely a trying time in my life, because my whole basketball career was just
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.740]   easy, easy, easy.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.140]   I remember being ranked for the first time in the eighth grade, I think I was 25th.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.660]   And then after that, it was just, I was rising to the top super quick, until all of a sudden
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.500]   I was the number one player in the country.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.140]   And then I committed to Mizzou, going back home, everybody was super excited and everything,
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.320]   and people were just treating me like I was like a god or something, walking around campus.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   It was crazy.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.100]   Everywhere I went, people, it was just, it was crazy.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.580]   So then that first game, when I, I told my dad, I remember telling dad, I was like, "Dad,
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.580]   I can't play.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.380]   I'm going through warm-up lines, and I can't really jump.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.420]   I don't know what's going on."
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.540]   And so, but the TV had already had the starters ready to announce, so coach was just like,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660]   "Mike, you got to start the game, but we'll pull you out right away."
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.820]   So I was like, "Dang."
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.220]   So I go in, knowing I'm coming out, and then I end up going to the locker room, and I get
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.020]   on the phone with the doctor, and he's like asking me if I can do certain things, and
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.260]   I'm trying it, you know, trying all these different exercises, whatever, I'm like, "I
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.260]   can't do these right now.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.260]   I don't know what's going on."
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.140]   And he's like, "Man, like, yeah, you're going to, you're probably going to have to get surgery."
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.460]   Like, I remember he told me that.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   I was like, "Oh."
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.860]   Like, I had no idea, like, because I had never had any injuries.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.660]   I didn't know that that's how you found out you were going to have to have surgery.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.020]   Yeah, like, he just told me, because I couldn't do something that he had asked if I could
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.860]   do through the phone.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.060]   And so then I remember, I remember just when that announcement came out, the next couple
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.060]   of days, it was like, it was a serious injury, and I was probably going to have to have surgery.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.700]   Man, it felt like the whole Mizzou fan base, everybody who, everybody just, you know, it
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   turned.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.540]   Like, all that love turned into hate.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.740]   Not necessarily hate, but it was like that love wasn't really there, but I heard people
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.100]   telling me, you know, "You're just sitting at a college game so that you can, like, skip
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.580]   college and go to the NBA."
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.460]   I had people saying, like, it was all types of stuff.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.440]   People were sending me crazy DMs, all this crazy stuff, like, and I was a young kid,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.660]   so it was just, that definitely took a toll on my mental.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.660]   How old were you?
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.660]   Were you 18?
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.660]   I was probably 17 or 18.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.740]   I was, uh, 18, 18, 19, probably 18.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.180]   But I was so used to everything being so easy for me, basketball-wise, that when that happened,
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.440]   it was just, like, it was, it was kind of devastating to me, I'm not going to lie.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.900]   But then I remember, you know, going through that process of the year rehab, and really
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.900]   deciding early on in that rehab process, "No, I'm going to use this for my benefit."
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.300]   My whole life, people have been praising me, whatever, but this is a time where I can really
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.340]   focus on my mental strength, find an identity outside of basketball, and so that's what
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.820]   I took it as.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.900]   And you know, I had doctors telling me I might not play again.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.900]   All this crazy stuff.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900]   I mean, you were in the hospital.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.940]   You heard me some of those nights, when that pain was crazy, and I was just like, "See,
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.940]   come on."
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.940]   Let me tell that story real quick.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.260]   Okay, so we were, he was in Chicago training for the draft, and it was after you got through
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.540]   all the rehab of your first surgery, and everything was going pretty smooth, like, your workouts
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.660]   were good, you were looking really healthy, and then one night, I know your back was bothering
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.500]   you that day a little bit, and then one night, it was late, it was probably like one or two
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.540]   in the morning, I was knocked, I was knocked out, and all of a sudden I hear, "Boom, boom,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.540]   boom," on the wall.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.940]   And I woke up so fast, I thought there was a robber.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.940]   I thought there was someone.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.940]   I text you from my room.
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.100]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, Michael, did you hear that?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   Somebody's breaking in."
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.420]   And you were like, you text me back, you're like, "That was me.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.420]   Can you get me some ice?"
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.420]   I was like, "It's not funny.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.420]   It's really not funny."
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Nah.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.480]   But I was like, "That's crazy," because I've never, you never handle pain like that.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.900]   You never, people thought you were just being soft, and I'm like, "That was the realest
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900]   thing I've ever seen."
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.900]   Yeah, no.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.660]   So, yeah, what she's talking about, I remember that so vividly, but I had, so basically I
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.660]   had used that whole year of Mizzou for rehab, and then I was getting healthy again, getting
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.540]   ready for the pre-draft, feeling decent, and then what ended up happening was I don't think
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.540]   I re-injured it.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.060]   I think it was a different level in my back or whatever that flared up.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.180]   So I ended up having to get another surgery, and realizing how much effort and time took
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.580]   into that first rehab, and realizing I was going to have to do that again, even though
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.420]   I was thinking that first rehab period, I'm going to use this for my benefit, really try
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.100]   to get mentally strong.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.120]   Once I heard the news that I was going to have to have a second surgery, it was like,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.620]   that definitely put me into a depression mode for a little bit, because I was like, "Dang,
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.980]   all this time spent, and I'm going to have to do it all over again, and now people are
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.100]   really going to be scared.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.340]   These teams that are drafting me are really going to be scared."
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.620]   So that's really what happened draft-wise.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.660]   People are like, "Why did he draft a 14?"
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.660]   It was because of that reason.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.420]   A lot of teams got scared once they realized I was going to have to have a second surgery.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.420]   I mean, rightfully so.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:15.400]   The doctor who wrote my report said that he didn't think I was going to play again.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.780]   So all these teams got really scared.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.140]   I was kind of scared myself, but I just knew in my head, "No, this is my purpose.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.780]   I'm supposed to walk out my purpose through basketball."
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.220]   That's why, back to the earlier question, Denver.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.140]   When Denver drafted me, and they showed that they believed in me, that just made me, like
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   I said at draft night, and I still say it today, I want to be the best draft pick that
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.540]   Denver has ever had, because just of the fact that they believed in me, they trusted my
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.380]   work ethic, all these things, it just makes me want to help give back to the program,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:59.280]   and also, because of God, I'm healing, I feel good, better than ever, and it's just dope.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.460]   Back to that question, I think through all of this, now, looking back at that, I think
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:11.560]   those two plus years of rehab, and just time away from basketball, and getting to focus
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.580]   on my mental, not really being in the spotlight, all these things, it helped create the person
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   that I am today.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.460]   I don't think that I would be who I am today without that period of time.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.420]   If I had just got drafted, been the number one pick, whatever, who knows where I would
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   be without the adversity, so I really viewed, like I used to think that it was the devil
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.340]   attacking me, like all this stuff happening because of the devil, but now I view it like,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.500]   no, God realized there's way more important things than basketball, I want you to become
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.220]   this certain type of person, so I'm going to put you through this really hard thing,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.380]   and looking back, it's like the biggest blessing I could have ever had.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.300]   And I think, too, like you said, you had to go through that adversity, I think that it
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.900]   teaches you that the God that's in the valley with you, that God that's in the pit with
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.100]   you, is the same God that's there with you on the peaks, so you're going to have these
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.420]   successes now, you're pretty well known now, and I don't think you would have handled that
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.180]   as well unless you learned that the God that's with you in the valley doesn't leave you,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.100]   and he's with you in the peaks, and it's still for him, he's still the reason.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.980]   I don't think I would have handled the success as well, and I just think that there's no
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:24.580]   telling who I would even be, I mean, who knows if all these things, if the NBA, whatever,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   would have changed me.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.700]   I've seen a lot of people changed by all these things, changed by money, changed by fame,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.500]   and when I got to become my own person, aside from basketball, basketball, you know, since
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.900]   I was three years old, it was all I did.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.540]   When I got that break from basketball and got to focus on me, I got to really take time
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.380]   to develop me, and I think that that is going to take me farther in life than basketball
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.260]   ever could, and God will always, like, when you give your life to God, he's always going
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.340]   to prune you, so I just view it as a pruning process.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.380]   I never would have become or fulfilled my purpose for him if I wouldn't have went through
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.860]   that adversity, so I view it as a blessing.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860]   Next question.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.840]   This one's, I like this one because it references one of the episodes.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.520]   So in the podcast with Aunt Nancy, you mentioned that you accepted God and Christ, but it was
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.380]   more recent that you started to actually live for him.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.780]   What are some ways that you embody Christ-like behavior when it's hard to?
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:24.500]   Yeah, well, I think that, like, I gave my life to God early on when I was little, but
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.540]   I never really, like, really tried to live it out for myself until I got to college and
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.500]   I realized I could do anything, whatever, and then I realized that's not what I want
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.820]   to be doing.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.860]   So now it's definitely a continual process, and every single year I'm trying to, like,
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.200]   grow in different characteristics or whatever.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.720]   I saw a good quote on Instagram.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.800]   Someone had posted on their story, it was like, "The scariest thing in the world is
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.280]   to be in the same place that you were last year," and then it was like, "Grow."
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.920]   And I think that that's all I've tried to do.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.560]   I mean, it's hard for anybody when they're not feeling like it to embody Christ, but
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.320]   I think that the way you do it is spending more time with Him and more time of things
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.960]   that are going to fill you up with good stuff instead of the bad things.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.800]   So, like, for me it's just being consistent in my Bible reading every morning, you know,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.120]   being consistent in some of the good music I listen to as well, or some of the good inputs,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.080]   because I really feel like you've got a good wolf and a bad wolf inside of you, and it's
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.960]   whatever one you feed more is going to be winning.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.480]   And I think that that's an overall theme for your life, but it's also a daily theme.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.160]   Like if you have more bad input that day than good input, you might act out a little bit
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.220]   more that day, but if you're filling yourself up that day with good things, then you're
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.240]   probably going to have more fruit that day.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.440]   So that's what I try to do.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   >> That's really good.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   I think this is a good question too, and it's, "How do you balance discouragement when you're
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.000]   not seeing results but you're working hard?"
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.120]   I think that you can kind of tie that into the whole bad wolf, good wolf thing.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.080]   >> Say that question one more time?
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.800]   >> How do you balance discouragement when not seeing results but you're working hard?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.220]   Like I'm sure you've gone through periods of time where you're working really hard and
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.240]   you, I mean, everyone goes through stuff when they're working hard and they plateau, or
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   they aren't seeing the results.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.600]   Like you can be working really hard in practice and it's not translating to on the court.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   I mean, even your first year healthy, you probably didn't get the minutes that you felt
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   like you wanted to get.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.680]   So how do you balance that?
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:29.240]   >> I think it's keeping your overall goals and your overall vision for your life in mind
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.920]   and realizing everything that God's gotten you through, he's gotten you through those
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.840]   plateaus before, but the plateaus are going to happen again.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.960]   So when you're in a plateau, like staying consistent.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.400]   If you don't fall off the rail and get into all your old bad habits and all these things
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.800]   and you stay consistent, stay consistent, then you're going to see a growth spurt.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.760]   And then it might plateau a little bit again, but if you stay consistent, you're going to
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   see another growth spurt.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.560]   Like life is never just an uphill the whole time.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.320]   So realizing that and realizing there's going to be plateaus and times when you're not really
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.760]   seeing the results of your hard work, those are the times you have to make sure that you're
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.280]   mentally strong and staying consistent in your grind.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.480]   >> For sure.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.620]   Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.240]   Do NBA players play for 10 years or is that like a way?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   >> Yeah, no, they play for 10 years.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.880]   >> Okay, let's just change it to where like, yeah, he's been playing forever.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.520]   Let's change it to like post-basketball because.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   >> Post-basketball.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.240]   Well, for me, I think I only want to play about 10 more years.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.760]   I want to play like two or three big contracts and then call it a day because I want to be
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.360]   done when I still feel great.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   But I think 10 years from now, I'm definitely going to be married.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.540]   I'm definitely going to have a few babies.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:50.080]   I think once I'm done with basketball, I want to take some time and get off of all social
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.840]   media and just disappear for like a year or two and go travel the world with my wife and
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   my family and just disconnect from the entire world.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.640]   And, you know, as basketball players, we're very used to being in the spotlight.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.080]   I want to know what it feels like to just live life without, you know, people judging
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.960]   all your moves and everything and just find some peace that way.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.360]   So that's something I've always wanted to do.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.840]   >> I bet that would be harder than you think because when you're used to getting like affirmation
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.040]   from thousands of people just going off the radar and just living it.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.720]   >> It definitely would be hard, but it's something that I feel like I've always wanted to do.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   You've talked about that before.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   >> Okay.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.680]   We're going to do one last one.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.720]   Let me find a really good one.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.560]   So you live such a busy lifestyle.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.080]   How do you keep authentic, genuine relationships with friends and family?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.880]   >> Yeah, I think it's impossible to be intentional and be super close with 100 different people.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.720]   So for me, it's my family and then a few few people outside of my family and really trying
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.120]   to nurture those relationships and be intentional about hitting them up.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.000]   You know, if they call me, I'm intentional about trying to pick up their calls like I
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.880]   can't do that for tons of different people.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.920]   But there's definitely a few people that I've decided that I want in my life.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.260]   And those are the ones I have to nurture.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.800]   So I think it's just one thing I've learned is it really is intentionality because it's
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   something that I lack.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.480]   I tend to just want to go through days and, you know, free flowing, whatever happens happens.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.200]   But to really grow relationships and to really it takes a lot of intentionality because everyone's
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   busy.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.080]   Everyone's so busy doing their thing, even like the family, like everyone's here right
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.200]   now on vacation together.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.000]   And I'm like, dang, I don't even hit up Isaac that much.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.320]   I don't talk to Javon as much as I should.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.280]   Sometimes we're all doing our own things, but it's just intentionality.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.320]   >> But, OK, I want to dig a little deeper on that.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.640]   Do you think it's hard for you when most people, not people in your life, but most people in
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.320]   the world have you on a pedestal, but then to like in your genuine relationships and
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.720]   friendships, like level that playing field?
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.840]   >> That's super important, I think.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.300]   And that's one of the reasons that I don't think that I will ever change with any success
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.160]   and money or anything, because I have people in my life that know me for me.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.760]   And if I got injured and never played again, they'd be the same towards me.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.840]   If I become the best player in the world, they'd be the same towards me.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   That's my family.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.040]   And then like my friends outside of my family that I'm close to.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.840]   So it definitely is harder, but like I have a good intuition.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:31.580]   I can tell right off the bat people's intentions, like girls and dudes, just like if they want
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.200]   something from me.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.360]   And then that just makes you, it definitely makes you put yourself in a shell a little
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   bit.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.720]   Like you want to branch out to meet more people.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.120]   But I'm also just like, I got seven siblings, two parents that love me, great friends.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.920]   Like I don't need that much more than, I don't need that much more.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   All I need is a shorty.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.920]   >> Cool.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   Just a shorty.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.520]   There was a lot of questions about that on here, but I didn't ask a shorty question.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   >> Okay.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.000]   There was a lot of like, what are you looking for in a woman?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.120]   >> Oh, you got to be bad for sure.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:11.000]   I mean, before bad, you definitely have to have a relationship with God because I'm not
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.400]   trying to pull someone along with me as I'm trying to, you know, run after my purpose
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   for God.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.960]   So you have to be on your own already pursuing God.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.280]   And a lot of girls will trick you.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.480]   They'll act way more spiritual or religious, even though I don't consider myself religious.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.880]   But way more spiritual, way more into that stuff just so that you are interested.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.160]   So you got to be able to see through that, but definitely that, number one.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.120]   But before that, I definitely got to be attracted to you.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.200]   And then besides that, I think being independent, like a lot of, but it's a balance between
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   being independent and being like servant-hearted.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   Because my mom is so servant-hearted, and I know the lifestyle I live, traveling, whatever,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.520]   I need a girl who's like going to hold it down and, you know, be down for that.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   Because there's a lot of girls who just want to chase after their dreams as well.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.560]   And you can do that, but it has to be a balance of being there for me and also, and then you
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.040]   got to be funny too, because I like to play around a lot, joke around a lot.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.240]   And then one thing that I value very, very much is like genuineness, down-to-earthness,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.680]   someone who can just go be spontaneous with me, and isn't bougie.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.760]   I can't stand bougie girls.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.080]   I feel that.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.920]   It's tough out there for you, but...
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   It is, but...
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   I'll be on the lookout.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   I set up Dante.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   I can set you up too.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   Yeah, you can set me up.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   But you gave me some good advice yesterday.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.040]   You were like, a couple of days ago, you were just like, don't entertain girls that you
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.840]   don't see yourself with, just wait, figure out how to be content with yourself, become
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.480]   that person that you want to attract, and then it'll, like God will bring it in due
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   time, so.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.260]   And it's easy for me to say now, because I've gone through three years of being single,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.800]   and there was times where it was really hard, and I really just wanted attention, and would
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.720]   talk to whoever, and then there's, I'm like, first off, time is our most precious commodity.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.640]   Why would I waste my time talking to someone that I know, they're not who I want to end
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.800]   up with, I know it's not going to be a forever thing, like, my time is so precious, and two,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.280]   like, that's other people's feelings, and other people's hearts, so you just got to
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.640]   be like, cool by yourself, and then you'll find someone, someone will come along that
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.080]   adds to that, instead of, like, depending on you, you know what I mean?
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.660]   Someone's already there, too, and it's cool with them, so.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660]   How tall are you?
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.660]   6'3"?
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.660]   Any 6'3" plus dudes out there watching this, you definitely got to, I got to interview
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.820]   you first to make sure that you're worthy, but she's single, and she's a great young
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.820]   gal, so.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.820]   I'm cutting this out.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   What's your Instagram?

[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.820]   I'm cutting this out.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.820]   Hit her up.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.740]   Well, no, hit me up, and then I'll see if you're worthy, and then we'll go from there.
