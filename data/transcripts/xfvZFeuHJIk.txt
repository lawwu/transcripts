[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   What's up everybody, I appreciate you guys tuning in to season one of Curious Mike.
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.900]   Right now we're doing a bonus episode where you guys get to be curious and ask me questions.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.840]   So let's get it going.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.860]   So for this bonus episode, we had you guys comment on an Instagram post, questions you
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.220]   wanted to ask me.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.220]   And so that's what we're going to do right now.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220]   I'm going to answer y'all's questions.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580]   I'm going to have my sister ask them to me.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.480]   I haven't seen any of them, so let's get it going.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   Let's get it going.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   Okay.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480]   So it's 204.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.400]   We're not going to get through all of them, but we will start with something easy.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.560]   Okay.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.100]   How has Denver helped you develop and grow not only as a Hooper, but as an individual?
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.180]   Yeah, I mean, I think when I first got drafted to Denver, I had never even visited Denver
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.220]   and I didn't really know what to expect.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.880]   But then going out there, it was like I fell in love with the city instantly.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.380]   The people are so down to earth, you know, it's a very healthy culture.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.600]   I've met tons of great people.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.180]   So off the court, it's been really just relaxing for me.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.340]   It's a chill city, but you can still have fun.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.140]   And then on the court, I mean, we got one of the best young teams in the league.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380]   I'm surrounded by a group of great dudes.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.780]   I think one thing that makes our team unique is just how selfless we are as a team.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.700]   Like everyone wants to see each other succeed.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.960]   And that's really refreshing to be on a team like that, because you hear stories of guys
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   that used to play on other teams coming to Denver, and it didn't used to be like that.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.100]   So it's definitely a blessing to be on a team like that.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.420]   For sure.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.580]   Okay.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.700]   What are your season superstitions or pregame rituals?
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.380]   Yeah, I don't really have too many superstitions.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.860]   I think a lot of players ask me about what separates NBA players from other players.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.020]   And I think one thing is just the routine.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.340]   So I don't have any superstitions, but I do have a routine that I stick to very closely
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.720]   before games.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.420]   That just includes all my pregame lifts, my pregame stretching.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.460]   I try to eat similar things every game day.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.820]   And then before I go out on the court, I always say like a prayer, and I try to read some
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.420]   scripture of the Bible just to calm my nerves and help me realize what's really important
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.540]   before I go out to play a game, because you can get in the thought process of how important
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.840]   the game is, but there's way more important things going on.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.140]   So when I could refocus my thinking, it just lets me go out there and play free and not
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140]   worry too much about the outcome, just be in the moment.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.140]   That's good.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.540]   I feel like you can tell the games where you're really playing free and just...
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.540]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.580]   I mean, I think it's...
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.540]   Some players, when they are really, really just locked in, thinking a lot, play their
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.540]   best.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.180]   But for me, when I'm playing free, just letting instinct take over and just being myself,
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.660]   then that's when I have by far the best game.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.380]   When I'm in my head or whatever, it's definitely not as free-flowing.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.380]   Okay.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.740]   This is actually a really good question.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.540]   What was it like having to sit out basically your whole college season, and what type of
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.060]   toll did it take on your mental health?
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.100]   This is something that a lot of people, they do know, but they don't really know the extent
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.100]   of it.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.300]   So that was definitely a trying time of my life because my whole basketball career was
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.220]   just easy, easy, easy.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.140]   I remember being ranked for the first time in the eighth grade, I think I was 25th.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.660]   And then after that, it was just, I was rising to the top super quick until all of a sudden
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.500]   I was the number one player in the country.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.140]   And then I committed to Mizzou, going back home, everybody was super excited and everything.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.340]   And people were just treating me like I was like a god or something, walking around campus.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.340]   It was crazy.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.100]   Everywhere I went, people, it was just, it was crazy.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.180]   So then that first game, when I, I told my dad, I remember telling dad, I'm like, "Dad,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.180]   I can't play.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.340]   I'm going through warm-up lines and I can't really jump.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.420]   I don't know what's going on."
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.100]   And so, but the TV had already had the starters ready to announce.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.180]   So coach was just like, "Mike, you've got to start the game, but we'll pull you out
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.180]   right away."
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.180]   And I was like, "Dang."
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.220]   So I go in, knowing I'm coming out.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.380]   And then I end up going to the locker room and I get on the phone with the doctor and
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.700]   he's like asking me if I can do certain things and I'm trying it, you know, trying all these
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   different exercises, whatever.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.020]   I'm like, "I can't do these right now.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.020]   I don't know what's going on."
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.220]   And he's like, "Man, like, yeah, you're going to, you're probably going to have to get surgery."
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.460]   Like, I remember he told me that.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   I was like, "Oh."
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.820]   Like, I had no idea, like, because I had never had any injuries.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.740]   I didn't know that that's how you found out you were going to have to have surgery.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.020]   Yeah, like, he just told me because I couldn't do something that he had asked if I could
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.860]   do through the phone.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.940]   And so then I remember, I remember just when that announcement came out, the next couple
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.180]   days it was like, it was a serious injury and I was probably going to have to have surgery.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.700]   Man, it felt like the whole Mizzou fan base, everybody who, everybody just, you know, it
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.540]   turned, like all that love turned into hate.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.100]   Not necessarily hate, but it was like that love wasn't really there.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.060]   I heard people telling me, you know, "You're just sitting out a college game so that you
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.580]   can, like, skip college and go to the NBA."
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.460]   I had people saying, like, it was all types of stuff.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.460]   People were sending me crazy DMs, all this crazy stuff, like, and I was a young kid,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.820]   so it was just, that definitely took a toll on my mental.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.820]   How old were you?
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.820]   Were you 18?
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.820]   I was probably 17 or 18.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.720]   I was 18, 18, 19, probably 18.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.180]   But I was so used to everything being so easy for me basketball-wise that when that happened,
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.440]   it was just, like, it was kind of devastating to me, I'm not going to lie.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.900]   But then I remember, you know, going through that process of the year rehab and really
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.900]   deciding early on in that rehab process, "No, I'm going to use this for my benefit."
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.300]   My whole life, people have been praising me, whatever, but this is a time where I can really
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.340]   focus on my mental strength, find an identity outside of basketball, and so that's what
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.820]   I took it as.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.900]   And you know, I had doctors telling me I might not play again.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.900]   All this crazy stuff.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900]   I mean, you were in the hospital.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.020]   You heard me some of those nights when that pain was crazy, and I was just like, "See,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.020]   come on."
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   Let me tell that story real quick.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.260]   Okay, so we were, he was in Chicago training for the draft, and it was after you got through
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.540]   all the rehab of your first surgery, and everything was going pretty smooth, like, your workouts
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.660]   were good, you were looking really healthy.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.260]   And then one night, I know your back was bothering you that day a little bit, and then one night,
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.460]   it was late, it was probably like 1 or 2 in the morning, I was knocked, I was knocked
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.460]   out.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.340]   And then all of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom on the wall.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.820]   I woke up so fast.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.940]   I thought there was a robber.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.940]   I thought there was someone.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.940]   I text you from my room.
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.540]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, Michael, did you hear that?
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540]   Somebody's breaking in."
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.460]   And you were like, you text me back, you're like, "That was me.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.460]   Can you get me some ice?"
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   I was like, "It's not funny.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.460]   It's really not funny."
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.540]   But I was like, "That's crazy."
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.460]   Because I've never, you never handle pain like that.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.020]   You never, people thought you were just being soft, I'm like, "That is the realest thing
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.020]   I've ever seen."
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020]   Yeah, no.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.580]   So, yeah, what she's talking about, I remember that so vividly, but I had, so basically I
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.340]   had used that whole year of Mizzou for rehab, and then I was getting healthy again, you
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.220]   know, getting ready for the pre-draft, feeling decent.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.940]   And then what ended up happening was, I don't think I re-injured it, I think it was a different
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.040]   level of my back or whatever that flared up.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.820]   So I ended up having to get another surgery.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.540]   And realizing how much effort and time took into that first rehab, and realizing I was
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.420]   going to have to do that again, even though I was thinking that first rehab period, I'm
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.140]   going to use this for my benefit, you know, really try to get mentally strong.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.140]   Once I heard the news that I was going to have to have a second surgery, it was like,
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.620]   that definitely put me into a depression mode for a little bit, because I was like, "Dang,
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.980]   all this time spent, and I'm going to have to do it all over again, and now people are
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.100]   really going to be scared.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.340]   These teams that are drafting me are really going to be scared."
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.380]   So that's really what happened draft-wise, you know, people are like, "Why did he draft
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.660]   a 14?"
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.860]   It was because of that reason, like a lot of teams got scared once they realized I was
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.380]   going to have to have the second surgery.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.380]   I mean, rightfully so.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   The doctor who wrote my report said that he didn't think I was going to play again.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.740]   So all these teams got really scared.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.140]   And I was kind of scared myself, but I just knew in my head, like, "No, like, this is
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   my purpose.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.540]   I'm supposed to walk out my purpose through basketball."
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.220]   And so that's why, back to the earlier question, Denver.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.140]   When Denver drafted me, and they showed that they believed in me, that just made me, like
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.020]   I said at draft night, and I still say it today, like I want to be the best draft pick
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.460]   that Denver's ever had, because just of the fact that they believed in me, they trusted
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.820]   my work ethic, you know, all these things, it just makes me want to help give back to
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.820]   the program.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.500]   And also, you know, I'm, because of God, like I'm healing, like I feel good, better than
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.140]   ever, and it's just dope.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:05.260]   But back to that question, I think through all of this, now, looking back at that, I
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:11.140]   think those two years, two-plus years of rehab, and just time away from basketball and getting
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.380]   to focus on my mental, not really being in the spotlight, all these things, it helped
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.340]   create the person that I am today.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.380]   And I don't think that I would be who I am today without that period of time.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.380]   If I had just got drafted, been the number one pick, whatever, who knows where I would
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.880]   be without the adversity.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.300]   So I really viewed, like I used to think that it was the devil attacking me, like all this
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.060]   stuff happening because of the devil, but now I view it like, no, God realized there's
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.740]   way more important things than basketball.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.400]   I want you to become this certain type of person.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.100]   So I'm going to put you through this really hard thing, and like looking back, it's like
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.380]   the biggest blessing I could have ever had.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.740]   And I think, too, like you said, you had to go through that adversity.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.380]   I think that it teaches you that the God that's in the valley with you, the God that's in
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.340]   the pit with you, is the same God that's there with you on the peaks.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.020]   So you're going to have these successes now.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.940]   You're pretty well-known now, and I don't think you would have handled that as well
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.260]   unless you learned that the God that's with you in the valley doesn't leave you, and he's
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.180]   with you in the peaks, and it's still for him.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.180]   He's still the reason.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.940]   I don't think I would have handled the success as well, and I just think that there's no
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.820]   telling like who I would even be.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.420]   I mean, who knows if all these things, if the NBA, whatever, would have changed me.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.700]   I've seen a lot of people changed by all these things, changed by money, changed by fame,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.500]   and when I got to become my own person, aside from basketball, basketball, you know, since
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.900]   I was three years old, it was all I did.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.540]   When I got that break from basketball and got to focus on me, I got to really take time
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.420]   to develop me, and I think that that is going to take me farther in life than basketball
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.560]   ever could.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.220]   And God will always, like when you give your life to God, he's always going to prune you,
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.340]   so I just view it as like a pruning process.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.620]   I never would have become or fulfill my purpose for him if I wouldn't have went through that
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.860]   adversity, so I view it as a blessing.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860]   Next question.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   This one's, I like this one because it references one of the episodes.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.540]   So in the podcast with Aunt Nancy, you mentioned that you accepted God and Christ, but it was
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.420]   more recent that you started to actually live for him.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.020]   What are some ways that you embody Christ-like behavior when it's hard to?
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:24.800]   Yeah, well, I think that, like I gave my life to God early on when I was little, but I never
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.020]   really like really tried to live it out for myself until I got to college and I realized
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:35.860]   I could do anything, whatever, and then I realized that's not what I want to be doing.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.820]   So now it's definitely a continual process, and every single year I'm trying to like grow
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.220]   in different characteristics or whatever.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.180]   I saw a good quote on Instagram, someone had posted on their story, it was like, "The scariest
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.820]   thing in the world is to be in the same place that you were last year," and then it was
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.940]   like, "Grow," and I think that that's all I've tried to do.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.580]   I mean, it's hard for anybody when they're not feeling like it to embody Christ, but
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:06.340]   I think that the way you do it is spending more time with him and more time of things
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.980]   that are going to fill you up with good stuff instead of the bad things.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.580]   So for me, it's just being consistent in my Bible reading every morning, being consistent
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.500]   in some of the good music I listen to as well, or some of the good inputs, because I really
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.740]   feel like you've got a good wolf and a bad wolf inside of you, and it's whatever one
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.940]   you feed more is going to be winning.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.580]   And I think that that's an overall theme for your life, but it's also a daily theme.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.340]   If you have more bad input that day than good input, you might act out a little bit more
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.500]   that day, but if you're filling yourself up that day with good things, then you're probably
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.260]   going to have more fruit that day.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.660]   So that's what I try to do.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660]   >> That's really good.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.220]   I think this is a good question too, and it's, "How do you balance discouragement when you're
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.020]   not seeing results but you're working hard?"
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.340]   I think that you can kind of tie that into the whole bad wolf, good wolf thing.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.100]   >> Say that question one more time.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.900]   How do you balance discouragement when not seeing results but you're working hard?
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.220]   I'm sure you've gone through periods of time where you're working really hard, and everyone
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.020]   goes through stuff when they're working hard and they plateau, or they aren't seeing the
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.020]   results.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.140]   You can be working really hard in practice and it's not translating to on the court.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.220]   Even your first year healthy, you probably didn't get the minutes that you felt like
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.220]   you wanted to get.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.700]   How do you balance that?
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:29.500]   >> I think it's keeping your overall goals and your overall vision for your life in mind,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.260]   and realizing everything that God's gotten you through.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.020]   He's gotten you through those plateaus before, but the plateaus are going to happen again.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.980]   When you're in a plateau, staying consistent.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.540]   If you don't fall off the rail and get into all your old bad habits and all these things,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.780]   and you stay consistent, stay consistent, then you're going to see a growth spurt.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.100]   It might plateau a little bit again, but if you stay consistent, you're going to see another
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   growth spurt.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.460]   Life is never just an uphill the whole time.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.700]   In that, realizing there's going to be plateaus and times when you're not really seeing the
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.140]   results of your hard work, those are the times you have to make sure that you're mentally
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.260]   strong and staying consistent in your grind.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.460]   >> For sure.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.620]   Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.180]   Do NBA players play for 10 years, or is that like a way-
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.180]   >> Yeah, no, they play for 10 years.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.180]   LeBron's like-
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.860]   >> Okay, let's just change it to where like, yeah, he's been playing forever.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.460]   Let's change it to like post-basketball, because-
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.200]   >> Post-basketball, well, for me, I think I only want to play about 10 more years.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.660]   I want to play like two or three big contracts, and then call it a day, because I want to
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.340]   be done when I still feel great.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.420]   But I think 10 years from now, I'm definitely going to be married.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.540]   I'm definitely going to have a few babies.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:50.740]   I think once I'm done with basketball, I want to take some time, get off of all social media,
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.940]   and just disappear for like a year or two, and go travel the world with my wife and my
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:00.700]   family, and just disconnect from the entire world.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.660]   As basketball players, we're very used to being in the spotlight.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.580]   I want to know what it feels like to just live life without people judging all your
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.980]   moves and everything, and just find some peace that way.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.420]   So that's something I've always wanted to do.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.860]   >> I bet that would be harder than you think, because when you're used to getting affirmation
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.020]   from thousands of people, just going off the radar, and just living it.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.700]   >> It definitely would be hard, but it's something that I feel like I've always wanted to do.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   You've talked about that before.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.700]   >> Okay.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   We're going to do one last one.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.740]   Let me find a really good one.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.600]   So you live such a busy lifestyle.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.140]   How do you keep authentic, genuine relationships with friends and family?
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:49.900]   >> Yeah, I think it's impossible to be intentional and be super close with 100 different people.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.740]   So for me, it's my family, and then a few people outside of my family, and really trying
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.980]   to nurture those relationships, and be intentional about hitting them up.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.020]   If they call me, I'm intentional about trying to pick up their calls.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.580]   I can't do that for tons of different people, but there's definitely a few people that I've
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.260]   decided that I want in my life, and those are the ones I have to nurture.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.940]   So I think it's just, but one thing I've learned is it really is intentionality, because it's
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940]   something that I lack.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.460]   I tend to just want to go through days, and free flowing, whatever happens, happens.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:28.140]   But to really grow relationships, and to really, it takes a lot of intentionality, because
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.220]   everyone's busy.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.460]   Everyone's so busy doing their thing.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.460]   Even the family, everyone's here right now on vacation together, and I'm like, "Dang,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.980]   I don't even hit up Isaac that much.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.020]   I don't talk to Javon as much as I should."
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.340]   I mean, it's because we're all doing our own things, but it's just intentionality.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.300]   >> But, okay, I want to dig a little deeper on that.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.620]   Do you think it's hard for you when most people, not people in your life, but most people in
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:56.820]   the world have you on a pedestal, but then to, in your genuine relationships and friendships,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.660]   level that playing field?
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.460]   >> That's super important, I think, and that's one of the reasons that I don't think that
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.940]   I will ever change with any success, or money, or anything, because I have people in my life
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.060]   that know me for me, and if I got injured and never played again, they'd be the same
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.060]   towards me.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.780]   If I become the best player in the world, they'd be the same towards me.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.860]   That's my family, and then my friends outside of my family that I'm close to, so it definitely
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.780]   is harder, but I have a good intuition.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.820]   I can tell right off the bat people's intentions, girls and dudes, just if they want something
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.980]   from me, and then that just makes you, it definitely makes you put yourself in a shell
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.060]   a little bit, like you don't really want to branch out to meet more people, but I'm also
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.780]   just like I got seven siblings, two parents that love me, great friends, like I don't
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.780]   need that much more.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.780]   >> Twenty more, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.780]   >> Yeah, I don't need that much more.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.780]   All I need is a shorty.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.780]   >> Cool.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.780]   Just a shorty.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.780]   There was a lot of questions about that on here, but I didn't ask them.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.780]   >> Ask a shorty a question.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.780]   >> Okay, there was a lot of, like, what are you looking for in a woman?
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:09.580]   >> Oh, you got to be bad for sure, but besides, I mean, before bad, you definitely have to
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.060]   have a relationship with God, because I'm not trying to pull someone along with me as
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.200]   I'm trying to, you know, run after my purpose for God, so you have to be on your own already
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.260]   pursuing God, and a lot of girls will trick you.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.420]   They'll act way more spiritual or religious, even though I don't consider myself religious,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.860]   but way more spiritual, way more into that stuff, just so that you are interested.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.700]   So you got to be able to see through that, but definitely that, number one, but before
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.780]   that, I definitely got to be attracted to you, and then besides that, I think being
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.820]   independent, like a lot of, but it's a balance between being independent and being, like,
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.700]   servant-hearted, because my mom is so servant-hearted, and I know the lifestyle I live, traveling,
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.340]   whatever, I need a girl who's, like, going to hold it down and, you know, be down for
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.540]   that, because there's a lot of girls who just want to chase after their dreams as well,
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.540]   and you can do that, but it has to be a balance of being there for me, and also, and then
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.100]   you got to be funny, too, because I like to play around a lot, joke around a lot, and
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:13.260]   then one thing that I value very, very much is, like, genuineness, down-to-earthness,
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:19.860]   someone who can just go be spontaneous with me, and isn't bougie, I can't stand bougie
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860]   girls.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.100]   - Yeah, I feel that.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.660]   It's tough out there for you, but...
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.660]   - It is, but...
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.660]   - I'll be on the lookout.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.660]   - Yeah.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   - I set up Dante.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.660]   I can set you up, too.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.340]   - Yeah, you can set me up, but you gave me some good advice yesterday.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:39.060]   You were, like, a couple days ago, you were just, like, don't entertain girls that you
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:44.900]   don't see yourself with, just wait, figure out how to be content with yourself, become
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:51.140]   that person that you want to attract, and then it'll, like, God'll bring it in due time,
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.140]   so.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.300]   - And it's easy for me to say now, because I've gone through three years of being single,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.840]   and there was times where it was really hard, and I really just wanted attention, and would
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.740]   talk to whoever, and then there's, I'm like, first off, time is our most precious commodity.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.700]   Why would I waste my time talking to someone that I know, they're not who I want to end
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.900]   up with, I know it's not going to be a forever thing, like, my time is so precious, and two,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.660]   that's other people's feelings, and other people's hearts, so you just got to be, like,
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.660]   cool by yourself, and then you'll find someone, someone will come along that adds to that,
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.140]   instead of, like, depending on you, you know what I mean?
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.700]   Someone's already there, too, and is cool with themselves.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.060]   - How tall are you, 6'3"?
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   - Yeah.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.580]   - Any 6'3" plus dudes out there watching this, you definitely got to, I got to interview
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.900]   you first to make sure that you're worthy, but she's single, and she's a great young
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.900]   gal, so.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.900]   - I'm cutting this out.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   - Instagram?
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.900]   - I'm cutting this out.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   - See you there, boy.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.900]   - I'm cutting this out.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   - Hit her up.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.860]   Well, no, hit me up, and then I'll see if you're worthy, and then we'll go from there.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.020]   - Anyways, great job answering questions.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.020]   We'll wrap this up.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.020]   - Sounds good.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   Appreciate you guys for tuning in.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:06.700]   We out.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.440]   (dramatic music)
