[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hello everyone, this is Tony. We have quite an episode for you today, but before we
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.480]   start I have a favor. We love serving you on this podcast and we want to serve you
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.040]   even better in 2020 and beyond. And to serve you better means we need to know
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   you better. And to that end we put together a brief little survey that
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840]   takes just a few minutes to fill out. You can go to DesiringGod.org/survey
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.800]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey and that survey will be up until the end of
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.480]   January. Here now is today's episode.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.720]   Well seven years ago this week we launched this podcast. 1,400 episodes
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   later here we are finally addressing the topic of sexualized dreams. Yes,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.920]   sexualized dreams. Easily one of the most asked about topics in the inbox and
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.840]   certainly the most asked about topic we've brushed off to date. No longer.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680]   Here's an email from an anonymous man. "Hello Pastor John and thank you for this
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.360]   podcast. I am 31, a believer, married for 12 years to a wonderful Christian woman.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.520]   I'm familiar with the commands of God about sexual sin and its eternal
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.560]   dangers. I have for almost a year now successfully battled sin with
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.940]   pornography thanks to prayer, God's Word, help from my wife, my pastor, and an
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.040]   outside organization that tracks internet activity for accountability
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.880]   purposes. I know and agree that sex outside of marriage is sinful and wrong.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.260]   Even that desire itself is sinful as Jesus said. My question though is as
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.280]   follows. Why do I have lucid sexual dreams with people other than my wife,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.960]   even people I've never met before? These dreams bother me intensely even after I
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.560]   wake up because I can't help but feel that I have sinned. And even worse, I feel
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.800]   as if I had no control over it as with most of my dreams. I have a pretty
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.520]   unhealthy sleep pattern partly because I would rather not dream at all. I am
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   quite troubled by it and any help would be appreciated. Pastor John, what would
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.560]   you say to him? The first thing I would say is that I don't know why this is
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   happening, so I don't want to pose as having a psychological or a spiritual or
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:17.040]   a physical hormonal surefire answer to what's going on. I think it's good to be
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.600]   bothered by it like he is and like others are, but not good to be undone by
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.280]   it. Let me make that distinction. Let me give four passages of Scripture that
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.520]   might shed light on the way dreams work, what they mean, what they're
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.200]   about, and then end with five very brief practical suggestions. And what I'm
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.320]   praying is that these texts just might be used by the Holy Spirit for some
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.760]   fresh power of deliverance from dreams that we can't control, but God can. So
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.800]   here's number one. Zechariah 10 verse 2. "The household gods utter nonsense, and
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.560]   the diviners see lies. They tell false dreams and give empty consolation.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.480]   Therefore the people wander like sheep. They are afflicted for lack of a
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.120]   shepherd." Now this simple point follows. There is such a thing as false dreams.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.800]   That doesn't mean claiming to dream when you don't dream. It's not like these
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.240]   folks were saying they had a dream and they didn't have a dream. That's
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.920]   not what it means. It means they're claiming that their dreams had a
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.800]   particular meaning, which they didn't. There are false meanings. Dreams
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.320]   come and they deliver false messages to us. So my first exhortation is, "Say to the
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.160]   Lord and to the dream and to the devil, 'That was a false dream.'" It does not
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.840]   mean I am unfaithful. I mean to be faithful to my wife. I am not unfaithful
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.000]   to her. Those dreams are a lie. So say that on the basis of the reality of the
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.240]   Bible that there is such a thing as a false dream. Here's number two. Deuteronomy
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.920]   13 1 to 3. "If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.120]   sign or a wonder, and that sign or wonder comes to pass, and he says, 'Let us go
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.760]   after other gods which you have not known and let us serve them,' you shall
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.880]   not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.400]   your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:07.800]   heart with all your soul." Wow! God uses false prophets and lying dreams, even
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.160]   accompanied by supernatural signs and wonders, to test his people. So it's not
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.320]   wrong, while these dreams are tormenting you, to say, "Dreams, Satan, brain, hormones,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.520]   whatever you are, I won't be sucked in by this. I see how my faith is being tested
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.280]   here. Do I love my wife? Do I love purity? Do I love holiness? Do I love Christ who
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.160]   died to make me pure? Yes, I do. I will not be undone by this test. I will pass
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.800]   it by faith in the blood of Jesus to cover all my sins, to empower me to walk
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   in the truth." So I think it's not wrong to say, "I don't know why, but I'm being
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.680]   tested by these dreams and I'm gonna pass this test." Here's number three, Isaiah 29
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.480]   7 and 8. This comes as close as anything, as far as I can see in the Bible, to a
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.240]   Freudian view of dreams, namely that they signal deep needs or desires, even sexual
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.960]   ones. Here's what it says, "The nations that fight against Israel shall be like a
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   dream, a vision of the night, as when a hungry man dreams, and behold he's eating,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.920]   and awakens with his hunger not satisfied, or as when a thirsty man dreams,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   and behold he's drinking, and he awakens faint with his thirst not quenched. So
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.120]   shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion." So the
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.080]   point of this text most immediately is the nations who think they're going to
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.280]   win against Israel will no more win than the dreamer got his thirst quenched in
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.040]   dreaming. That's the point. Now here's my reason for pointing out this text. It's
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.400]   not that. It was common knowledge, evidently. Thirst might make a person
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.360]   dream of drinking only to be frustrated. Hunger might make a person dream about
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.560]   eating only to wake up hungry. And I would say in the same way sexual
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:39.520]   hormones, desires, impulses, born of nature, might make a person dream he's having
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:47.760]   sex, and he wakes up and he didn't have sex. Now that does not explain why you
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.920]   would dream about women who are not your wife. That may be traced to old patterns
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:03.320]   of fantasies that go back 30 years, 20 years, 15 years, and need to be broken. But
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:10.600]   the point here is there is nothing remarkable when a physical craving like
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.840]   hunger or thirst or sexuality cause a dream that the craving is being
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.040]   satisfied when it isn't. And the question is what will you do with it in the
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.640]   waking life? That's the question. Not just that it's happening. Here's the last one.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   Job 33 14 following. God speaks in one way and in two, though man does not
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:43.520]   perceive it. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:50.600]   while they slumber on their beds, then God opens the ears of men and terrifies
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   them with warnings that he may turn aside man from his deed and conceal
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.520]   pride from man. He keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.560]   the sword. That's amazing. That text teaches that God really does use dreams
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:17.880]   to terrify us with warnings in order to humble our pride and keep us back from
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:25.080]   sin. But if that's true, one way to look at sexually illicit dreams, that is
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.120]   dreams when you're doing illicit things in the dream, one way to look at them is
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:38.600]   that God is terrifying us in our dreams of the horror of this prospect in real
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.560]   life so that we won't do it. So we're back at the idea of being tested, like it
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.960]   said earlier. Will the dream have its God-appointed effect of humbling us,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:01.000]   frightening us about our own bent to sinning, and will we lay hold on him for
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.500]   purity in waking life? So here are my five quick bullet suggestions flowing
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.240]   from those few biblical observations. Number one, pray earnestly for deliverance
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.920]   from the dreams and gather some brothers around you to join in earnest prayer.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.280]   Number two, read the scriptures for five or ten minutes just before you go to
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.800]   sleep. Some portion about God's work and his value, like Philippians 3 8 or
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.880]   Colossians 1 15 to 18 or Hebrews 1 1 to 3, soak your mind in the Word just before
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.580]   you go to sleep. Number three, purge your movie and TV habits of all sexually
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.320]   stimulating content. Not just porn, but worldly sexuality. Now that's just about
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.600]   all TV shows and all movies. Sorry about that. You don't need it. Christians for
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   2,000 years did not feed their minds on movies every night. It won't help you to
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.280]   be stirred up by so-called PG-13 movies that have sexually titillating scenes in
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.440]   them. Number four, perhaps get a sleep study done. I've had these, my wife has
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.480]   had this, to see whether or not there are any physical irregularities. And number
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   five, the last one, when all is said and done, trust the promises of Psalm 25 and
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.160]   say with confidence, "My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will pluck my
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.280]   feet out of the net." That's verse 15. Profound insights here, Pastor John, to
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.560]   one of the most perplexing questions we get in the inbox. Thank you for
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   addressing it. Well, what does your marriage most need from you? That's a
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.440]   great question. It's a searching question. And it's up next time when we return on
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.840]   Wednesday. Until then, if you're willing to help us out, fill out our online
