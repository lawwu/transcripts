[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.920]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6 and verse 16, the 16th verse in the 6th
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.000]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.040]   "Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.600]   of the wicked."
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:44.160]   Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.240]   of the wicked.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.400]   We proceed, in other words, to consider yet another piece and portion of this whole armour
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.560]   of God, which the apostle reminds these Ephesians is so essential to a successful warfare against
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.400]   the devil and against the principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   of this world, against the spiritual wickedness in high places which are set against us.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.280]   There is nothing more important in the Christian life than that we should realise that we are
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.000]   engaged in this perpetual warfare against these forces that are set against us.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.200]   And it is such a test, a trial, that the apostle assures us that nothing will avail us except
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.480]   that we be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and that we put on, in addition,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.400]   the whole armour of God.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.680]   And now we are considering the various parts and portions of this armour as they are put
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   before us here by the great apostle.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.960]   Now as we come to look at a new piece, a fresh piece of this armour, I would again emphasise
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.240]   the fact that it is quite clear that we should be paying great detailed attention to this.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.160]   The apostle would not have troubled to mention the various parts unless that had a real significance.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.800]   He does not just say put on the whole armour of God and leave it at that.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   He reminds us in detail of what it is, by which of course he instructs us that we are
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.320]   to take these things one by one and to work them out in detail.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.240]   And that is what we have been attempting to do.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.200]   Now we have already considered three pieces of this armour of God.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.560]   We have seen that we must have our loins girt about with truth.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.800]   That is the foundation of everything.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.040]   Then we have had to put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   And we have also seen that we have to have our feet shod with the preparation of the
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.200]   gospel of peace.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.880]   And now we come to the fourth piece.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   But you notice that he introduces this in a very interesting manner.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.720]   So far it has been an addition, one to another, but now there is a kind of break.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800]   Obviously we have come to a point of transition.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.360]   Above all, he says, taking the shield of faith.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.840]   Now this is something which must attract our notice and our attention.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.880]   It is indeed a point of transition.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.280]   The pieces of this armour, as we indicated at the beginning in introducing the whole
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.360]   armour of God, can be divided into two main groups.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   And we have already dealt with the first group, but now here we come to this second group.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.960]   And we shall see that the parts of the second group differ in certain respects from the
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.160]   members or the portions of the first group.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.440]   You notice again how important these details are.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.520]   The apostle calls attention to these things.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.080]   So he says, above allâ€”now let us be clear about the interpretation of that statement.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   The tendency is to take it, as it is translated here in the authorised version, as meaning
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.880]   above everything else in importance, above all, above everything.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.580]   But it does not mean that.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.200]   It does not mean that at all.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   It really means in addition to all, in addition to what I have already been saying, or with
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.680]   all, with these three parts that I have already mentioned, you must also.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.200]   That is what it really means.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.520]   And this introductory phrase, above all, really introduces everything that is to follow, not
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.360]   only the shield of faith, but also the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit as
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   well.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.160]   It is a general introduction to these additional portions which he now is going to put before
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400]   us.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.880]   Now notice again another way in which he calls our attention to the difference.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   You see, he is making a break, and the above all indicates the break.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.880]   But there is another thing that indicates the break.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   So far he has been using the word having.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.640]   "Stand therefore," he says, "having your lines got about with truth, and having on
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.400]   the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   of peace."
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.160]   Now he changes his word.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.240]   Above all he says, not having the shield of faith, but taking the shield of faith.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.360]   "Wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.680]   helmet," not have the helmet, but take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.600]   and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.280]   Now there again he is just saying to us, "Now I want you to notice that there is a difference
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.800]   between the three portions that are to come and the three portions that I have already
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.280]   mentioned to you.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.280]   And the difference is the difference between having and taking."
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.320]   What does that suggest to us?
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   Well I think there are two main things here.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.400]   The first three portions of the armour are parts that are fixed to the body by a special
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.760]   fastening.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.600]   We noticed that in the case of the girder.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.720]   It is something that you fix on, you clamp on, as it were, and you put it firmly in position.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.680]   And in exactly the same way with the breastplate of righteousness, you fix it on to you, you
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.800]   gird it on to you, you tie it on to you.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.600]   It has got to be fixed in such a manner that as you move about it will not be loosely sliding
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.640]   hither and thither, but it is firmly fixed, laced up in a tight manner so that it cannot
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   move.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.240]   And the same obviously must be true about the sandals, because if the sandals are not
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   firmly fixed, well, we shall not be able to stand firmly and we certainly will not be
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.280]   able to have that mobility and agility to which we have been calling attention.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.840]   Now then, the first three are parts of armour, therefore, that are firmly fixed to the body
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:40.240]   by this special fastening, so that they are immovable, as it were, and parts and portions
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   of us.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   But with the next three, the position is quite different.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   You do not fix a shield on to yourself and on to your body.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.680]   No, no, a shield is something apart from you.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.600]   You take it up and use it, but it is not attached to you, it is not fixed to you.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.160]   The same applies to the helmet.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.680]   The helmets as they used them then were not something firmly fixed to the body, it was
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.000]   more like a kind of cap that was put upon the head and taken off quite easily.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.360]   And of course the sword is clearly again something that is not a part of us, as it were, but
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.240]   something that we take up and use as the need arises.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.360]   So there is an interesting difference at once, and it shows why the Apostle drops his term
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.040]   'having' and says 'taking'.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.600]   You see, you have this armour on you always, but you take up the shield and the sword and
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   take up your helmet and put it on.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.840]   Well, there is the first point of distinction between the two.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.480]   But I think this comes out also in a kind of secondary manner, which really is an outcome
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.040]   of the first.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:58.960]   And it is this, that the first three portions are more or less passive and preparatory.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.760]   The man, the soldier, puts them on and keeps them on.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.000]   But now when you come to these others, there is a suggestion immediately of activity.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.080]   The soldier may be sitting down in his room in the barracks and taking a period of rest,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.480]   but he still has on his girdle of truth and his breastplate and his sandals.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   Then suddenly an alarm is given that the enemy is already attacking and on the way, and he
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.960]   immediately takes hold of his shield and his sword, puts on his helmet and rushes out.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:36.480]   There is that whole suggestion of an activity, of an actual fight and battle.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.240]   It is a picture of energy.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.480]   So you take it up and rush out.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.560]   You do not always have the shield in your hand when you are resting.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.080]   You put your shield down and likewise your sword.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.560]   But the moment the enemy becomes active again and there is an engagement, well, these are
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.320]   things that you have to take up at once in order that you may be ready for the battle
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   and the conflict.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.960]   Well, now then, I am saying all this in order that we may see why the apostle goes out of
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.880]   his way in this manner to call attention to the fact that there is something different
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.520]   now, above all, in addition to all.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.640]   Take, take up, instead of having.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.040]   Very well, there is the first point and an important one.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:33.800]   Now we must just say a word also about the shield, because the apostle is conveying spiritual
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.040]   truth by means of these pictures and analogies, and he means us to take them seriously and
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   to take them in detail.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.920]   Well, now, what kind of shield was this, which was used by the Roman soldier whom he is taking
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.560]   as his example at that time?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.880]   And the answer is that it was a very large shield.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.960]   We become accustomed to think of shields as something smaller, but the shields that were
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.280]   then used, and you can still see some of this type in certain museums, they were very large
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   shields.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.160]   It was about four feet in length and two and a half feet wide.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.440]   The original idea was a sort of door which you had in front of you or behind which you
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.080]   were hiding, but then it became something that was shaped into an oblong shape, and
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.020]   it was meant, as you can see, to cover most of the body.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.600]   It was a very large one, so that virtually most of the body could be covered by itâ€”four
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.840]   feet by two and a half in breadth.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:45.680]   But still more important in this connection is the fact that this shield had a fireproof
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.960]   metal lining placed upon it, and the significance of that, of course, emerges immediately.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:59.560]   Well, there it was, made of wood, but it has this fireproof metal lining of this placed
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.120]   upon its surface, so that as you hold it up to face the enemy who is throwing his fiery
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.880]   darts, these darts are faced by this fireproof metal lining.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.040]   Now the idea is obviously that in addition to the breastplate, which we have already
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.580]   got on, and the girdle of truth about the lines and the feet, you still protect yourself
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:29.320]   in a more general manner, so that these darts don't strike upon the breastplate, but you
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.080]   have your shield to protect you against these things that come in a kind of preliminary
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   way before the enemy comes himself, sword in hand, in order to attack you still more
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   directly.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.200]   That's clearly the picture which is meant to be conveyed.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.840]   But now let's take this further description which the apostle gives us.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:58.480]   This he says is necessary in order that we may be able to quench all the fiery darts
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.440]   of the wicked.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.800]   And here again it's interesting to notice the picture which he implies.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.160]   These fiery darts really explain themselves.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   They made these darts either of wood or of metal.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.080]   The point was, of course, that they had a point, a sharp point, a kind of arrow or a
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   kind of dart.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.160]   But this is what they did.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.720]   They used to take material and soak this material in some inflammable matter, and then they'd
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   wind this material, impregnated in this way with this inflammable matter, round the point
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120]   of the dart.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.720]   They'd wind it tightly so that it was firmly in position.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.160]   And then when they were ready to attack the enemy, they used to ignite this inflammable
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:54.440]   material and it would burst into flame and they'd hurl the darts in the direction of
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   the enemy.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   The idea being, of course, that if one of these should happen to penetrate it, it would
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:06.840]   burst still more into flame and burn some portion of the enemy's body and render him
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.360]   inactive and so prepare the way for the mass attack of the troops upon those who were opposed
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   to them.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.800]   Well, now then, they used to make these darts, therefore, and when the time came, they'd
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.160]   light them and they'd throw them in great profusion, throw them in large numbers from
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.480]   all conceivable directions so as to cause confusion in the ranks of the enemy.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   And then, having prepared the way in that manner, the troops would then advance.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.720]   Therefore this, of course, was just that ancient way of doing what's been done in modern warfare
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:46.040]   in this present century, the preliminary barrage of the guns to prepare for the advance of
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   the infantry.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.480]   That's the idea, or any bombing that takes place.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   That's how it's done at the present time.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.600]   But this is how they did it in those days.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.720]   And this, of course, is a very much more perfect picture of what the apostle is dealing with
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.960]   spiritually than is the modern method of warfare.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.080]   Now then, who is it that throws these darts?
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.280]   Well, the authorised translation here says, "the fiery darts of the wicked."
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.120]   But that's an unfortunate translation.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.520]   It really means the wicked one, or the evil one.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   Now, why do I trouble to emphasise that?
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   Well, there's a very good reason for doing that.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:35.200]   The apostle himself has reminded us that we don't fight evil regarding it as something
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.740]   abstract or impersonal.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:43.840]   He himself has gone out of his way to say that we are confronted by the wiles of the
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.160]   devil.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.880]   And not only the devil, but these principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   of this world and spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:02.440]   His whole object is to say that we are fighting spiritual persons, forces, beings.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   And if ever it was necessary to emphasise that, it is at the present time.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.480]   As we've often pointed out in dealing with this great passage, the world no longer believes
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.840]   in the devil, still less in spiritual beings and entities.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.800]   The world doesn't believe in angels nor in devils.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.120]   That's a great part of its trouble.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.760]   It's because it's ignorant of all this that it is as it is.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.920]   So it's particularly important that we should translate this correctly.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.400]   The wicked.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   What is the wicked?
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.820]   Well, the wicked is the wicked one.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:40.640]   It's the devil again, and all the forces and the powers and the agents that he commends
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   and controls.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.560]   Never, I say, was it more important that we should realise this, that we are involved
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   in a tremendous spiritual warfare.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:59.840]   There is the triune God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, three persons.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.200]   God is person.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.840]   God is not a force, God is not a power, but neither are the forces against us, just a
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:15.560]   force or a power, but persons again, these agencies, these intelligences.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.640]   And as I have again, often, so often pointed out, we don't begin to understand the problem
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.560]   of life in this world, even this morning, unless we understand something about this
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.740]   teaching.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:36.180]   We don't understand our own personal experience, still less do we understand the whole state
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.960]   and condition of the world as it is.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.560]   My dear friends, we wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:54.280]   Our striving, our problem is not merely man and his sin and his evil behind him.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:02.920]   There are these infernal powers, these devilish agencies, these spiritual entities.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.640]   That is the whole teaching of the Bible.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:13.560]   Mr. Todd was announcing the title of the present contribution in the Westminster Record, "The
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.440]   Origin of Evil," and I have tried in that to trace the origin of all this.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.480]   We mustn't think in terms of evil as something abstract, or wickedness as something abstract.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.800]   The whole teaching of the Bible is that this is something that is manipulated and carried
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.000]   on by these beings, these entities, these persons.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.120]   Our Lord had to meet the devil, a person, in the temptation in the wilderness.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.640]   He wasn't tempted by evil, he was tempted by the devil.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.160]   So it is, I say, of extreme importance that we should translate this as "able to quench
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   all the fiery darts of the wicked one."
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:19:00.120]   Now you'll find a similar statement in the first epistle of John, in the fifth chapter.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.640]   It's a wrong translation again in the authorised version in the nineteenth verse.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.960]   He says, "And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.000]   Well, of course it's true, but what the apostle actually wrote was, "The whole world lieth
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.520]   in the wicked one, in the embrace of Satan, the one whom the Lord Jesus Christ described
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.960]   as the strong man armed."
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.880]   Let's get rid of the notion then of abstract evil.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.520]   There's no such thing.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.040]   There's no such thing as evil apart from persons.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.800]   There'd be no evil in the world if there were not evil persons, and there'd be no
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:47.120]   evil human beings unless they were evil spiritual beings who entered into God's creation and
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.600]   tempted men and brought him down in the calamity of the fall.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.880]   There, in other words, is the whole explanation of the state of the world this morning.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.000]   Very well, there's our description.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But now let's come to the spiritual application in a more personal sense.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.720]   What's the apostle saying here?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:13.680]   Well, what he's telling us is this, that we must be prepared for what we may describe
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:23.520]   as satanic attacks and assaults, which at times can be unusually fierce and fiery.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.360]   That's what he's saying.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.760]   In addition to all his other activities, all the implements of the instruments that he
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.320]   implies these fiery darts.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   And they are fiery.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.640]   They burst into flame, and they're very destructive.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.400]   That's why they use them.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:50.920]   Now this is something which is of vital importance for us in our spiritual warfare.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.480]   There have been many masters of the spiritual life who've described this kind of thing
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   in detail.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.840]   The best-known examples, of course, are Martin Luther and John Bunyan.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.800]   No two writers have ever dealt more specifically or clearly with this particular aspect of
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   the Christian's warfare than those two particular men.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.480]   Luther, you remember the famous occasion of his inkpot throwing at the devil, conscious
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.920]   of his presence in his room, couldn't get away from him.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.760]   Whatever he was trying to do, the devil was there hurling things at him.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.960]   That's the notion.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:29.080]   And John Bunyan testifies in his way to exactly the same thing.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.160]   But what of our own experiences?
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.800]   How important it is for us to realize this.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.320]   Don't we all know something about this?
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.720]   Don't we all know something of what it is perhaps to wake up in the morning, and before
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.400]   you've had time to do any thinking at all, thoughts come to you.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.040]   Evil thoughts, blasphemous thoughts.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   You were not thinking.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   You were doing nothing.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   You'd just awakened.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.120]   Suddenly, they come.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.320]   That's the sort of thing which the apostle means by the fiery darts of the wicked one.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:10.800]   Now, it's important for us to realize this for this good reason, that it is a part of
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:16.440]   the enemy's strategy to prevent our understanding that he is the cause of all this.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.720]   He would have us believe, of course, that all these things arise within us.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.800]   And then the logic is quite simple.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   Because all these things arise in you, you must be a very evil person.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.720]   Otherwise they'd never arise in you, and therefore you're not a Christian at all.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:37.600]   And so he gets you down into the depths of despair and utter hopelessness about yourself.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.360]   So there is nothing so vital for us as to realize that it is he who is responsible for
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   all this.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.400]   Well, there, I'm giving you some illustrations of it.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.440]   There you are, waking up in the morning, and immediately they come.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.720]   But not only that, haven't you often found this?
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.920]   When you've been engaged in prayer and trying to pray, they come from all directions at
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   you.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.160]   Now, your one desire at the moment is to be concentrating on God and on worship and prayer
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.200]   and adoration, but you're filled with all these thoughts and notions and ideas.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Where do they come from?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   Here's the answer.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.460]   Haven't you found it when you're reading the Bible?
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.140]   You can read a newspaper and concentrate on it, but when you start reading the Bible,
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:29.180]   the thoughts and ideas come from all directions and you find it almost impossible to concentrate.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.180]   Where do they come from?
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.320]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.840]   These are the fiery dots of the wicked one.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   The point that's so important for us to grasp is this, that they're obviously something
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.600]   that come from the outside.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.680]   They're not generated in us.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.200]   They came to us.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   They strike us.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.080]   We even use these expressions, "suddenly struck me," or "the thought came to me,"
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   and so on.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.240]   Well, not only that, but we can add to it in this way.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.080]   There's a curious kind of periodicity about all this.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.000]   This isn't a permanent state.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.760]   It can happen at any moment.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.960]   But it does seem to be the case that there are times and seasons when the enemy is unusually
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.040]   active in this respect.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.760]   You see, this whole analogy of warfare is such a perfect one.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.200]   Take what you had in the First World War in particular with trench warfare.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.760]   There may or might have been days when there was a kind of lull.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.160]   The enemy was still there, and you couldn't afford to take any risks.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.320]   If you exposed yourself, you'd be shot at.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.360]   But on the whole, there was a lull, nothing very much happening.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.240]   Then suddenly, a barrage would suddenly come down upon the enemy.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.000]   That's the sort of thing that happens in this spiritual realm.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.440]   And there's nothing so important for us as to realize this.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.040]   You never know what a day is going to bring forth.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.720]   The fact that you may have had a wonderful day of blessing doesn't guarantee you'll
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.680]   be all right tomorrow.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.960]   That may be the very occasion when the enemy will suddenly hurl his darts upon you, of
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   all types and kinds and shapes and from all conceivable directions.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.000]   And he may go on doing it the whole day.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.880]   He may go on doing it for a number of days.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.440]   There is no question at all.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.360]   But there are such things as satanic attacks.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   There are times when the enemy concentrates on Christian individuals or upon Christian
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.720]   churches or sections of the Christian church, almost upon countries.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:38.160]   And in this malign and infernal manner, does his utmost to destroy everything by hurling
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.720]   these fiery darts at us.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   What are they?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:48.160]   Well, again, they can take almost any form.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.480]   The commonest of all, of course, is with regard to thoughts.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.360]   He hurls doubts at us.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   Some of the greatest saints have been plagued from time to time by horrible doubts.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.080]   They were hurled at them.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.660]   Thoughts came into their minds, suggestions, queries, questionings.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.660]   They didn't want this.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.560]   They did their utmost to drive them up, but still they came and kept crowding in upon
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.080]   them.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.520]   Many of the greatest saints have testified to that.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.880]   "Oh, the devil hurled these fiery darts in this way," but there are even worse things
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.360]   than that.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:35.800]   He has often plagued some of the noblest saints with blasphemous thoughts, blasphemous thoughts
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.880]   about God, blasphemous thoughts about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.680]   Horrible, horrifying.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.200]   Some of the greatest saints.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.760]   And as I was explaining just now, it's here, you see, the thing can be so tragic.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.080]   What the devil hopes and trusts is that this unfortunate saint will assume that they are
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   his own thoughts.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.600]   And, as I say, the logic is inevitable.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.360]   How can a man as a Christian possibly harbor such thoughts about God?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.800]   No, no, they're not the Christian's thoughts at all.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.400]   They're the fiery darts of the wicked one.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.080]   And then he will hurl words and phrases, oaths.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.640]   The most horrible language will be hurled at him.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   His mind will be as it were filled with these.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.800]   And none of them arise in the believer himself.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.300]   It's the devil trying to shake him.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.400]   It's the devil trying to get him down, trying to confuse him, trying to persuade him that
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.000]   he's not a Christian, that he's never been a Christian.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.120]   These are some of the ways in which they come.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.160]   And chiefly, as I'm saying, in the realm of thoughts.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   Oh, it is indeed instructive to read of this in the lives of saints.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.600]   Thank God for it, I say.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.680]   Thank God that they've ever been recorded.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.480]   Because it's a great help to a poor Christian when this kind of thing happens to him, and
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.080]   when he imagines that it's never happened to anybody else.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.120]   And therefore it must be the case that he is not a Christian, because the thing is inconceivable.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.280]   Very well then, remember not only what the apostle says here, but see its confirmation
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.960]   in the life and in the experience of some of the greatest and most wonderful saints
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.080]   that have ever adorned the life of the Christian church.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.360]   But in addition to thoughts, imaginations.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.840]   There is nothing that he cannot do in that respect.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.280]   My friends, we are confronted by the wiles of the devil.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.360]   And his ingenuity is almost endless.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:49.000]   He can conjure up scenes, he can depict events, he can make things so vivid he can make them
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   real.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.480]   Thus he hurls his fiery darts at us in the realm of the imagination.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.080]   Then obviously he does so in the realm of the desires and the passions and the lusts.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.880]   Fiery darts, inflaming, inciting, rousing up with this tremendous heat.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   That's what he's conveying to us.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.320]   This is the Christian life, my friends.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   Don't you know it as such?
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Don't you realize how true it all is?
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.000]   If you don't, I don't think you're a Christian at all.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.760]   You're so much in the grip and in the arms of the devil that you're not even aware of
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.520]   the fact that it's happening.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.680]   This is the lot of every Christian, and it happens to all at some time or another, in
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.240]   some shape or another.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.660]   We must be ready for this.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.600]   We must always have that shield in a convenient position so that we can take it up.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   It's our only hope.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.940]   That's what he's telling us.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:51.400]   And I would add one other thing to this list of the ways in which he may do this.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.440]   Persecutions.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   As the hymn, "If through fiery trials your pathway should lie, fiery trials."
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   And again, the history of the Church is full of this kind of thing.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.360]   Indeed, there are many Christian people who are passing through fiery trials while we
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.920]   are meeting in the peace and the safety of this house of God.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.560]   They're in a furnace.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.960]   As the young men were in Daniel's time, it's a fiery trial.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:32.680]   Oh, the apostle Peter, you remember, in the fourth chapter of that first epistle of his,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:40.400]   which I read just now, he uses that very expression, "Beloved," he says in the twelfth verse,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.440]   "think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.760]   strange thing happened to you."
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.400]   It isn't strange.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.080]   It's the lot of God's people.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.000]   It always has been.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.560]   It always will be.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:03.120]   "Yea, and all which are godly in Christ Jesus," says Paul to Timothy, "shall suffer persecution."
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.580]   And it can be very fiery.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.940]   It can be very trial.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.040]   He can bring all these things suddenly to bear upon us.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   And what's he trying to do?
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   Well, he's trying to alarm us.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.720]   He's trying to fill us with fears.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   Are they going to kill us?
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.320]   Are they going to take everything from us?
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.400]   Am I going to lose my position because I'm a Christian?
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.320]   He'll bring his fiery trials in those ways.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.400]   Or you'll be troubled about your wife and family.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.760]   You'll be troubled about your church, about the whole cause of Christ.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.360]   Terrible periods of persecution come to the Christian church.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.680]   Again, there may be long intervals when there's no persecution at all, except in some minor
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.960]   manner, just an occasional shot here and there.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:44.720]   But sometimes he, as it were, has been preparing this great mess of fiery dots, and he hurls
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:51.520]   them all together at the same time, and on it goes for a great period.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.760]   Many good Christian people endured all that during the Hitler regime in Germany.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.760]   There are Christian people enduring this kind of fiery trial at the present time.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.720]   These fiery dots are the wicked one.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.240]   And we may get it individually.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.000]   It comes in periods.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.200]   There are people who may even belong to us and be dear to us who are not Christians.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.920]   They leave us alone for a long time.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.720]   And suddenly, as if the devil were let loose on them, they suddenly attack and they go
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   on for a period.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.520]   Then they stop again and back again and so on.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.040]   Fiery dots of the wicked one.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.760]   Well, that's the kind of thing that the apostle is putting before us.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.600]   And what he tells us is this.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.400]   There's only one way to deal with this.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Have the shield ready.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   What is the shield?
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.080]   Well, he says it is the shield of faith.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   Shield of faith.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.640]   What does he mean by this?
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.480]   It's the only thing that can quench all the fiery dots of the wicked one.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   You see the idea.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   As these things are coming, you don't hold forward your breast and let them strike this
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.340]   breastplate of righteousness.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.280]   What you do is to take your shield, hold it up, and they hit against that portion of the
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.680]   shield where there is this lining which is put there specifically to deal with this problem.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.160]   And they burst against that and they can do you no harm.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.120]   You just hold it in and you must be ready.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.640]   That's why your feet, you see, must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.720]   You've got to be mobile and agile.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.440]   And you hold your shield in all directions and you quench one here, one there, and in
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.520]   all directions, and so you save yourself a lot of trouble.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.960]   You don't have to extricate them from the joints of the armour and things like that.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.160]   And so you save yourself, as I say, great trouble.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   The shield of faith.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   That's the shield.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   What does it mean?
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.720]   Well, now, the scripture itself answers the question.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.640]   Take what we read again at the beginning in that first epistle of Peter.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.320]   You see, they're all teaching the same thing.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.040]   That's the wonderful thing about the Bible.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.880]   It's only got one message.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.120]   They all preach the same message.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.160]   You can call in Peter to interpret Paul and Paul to interpret Peter and John to interpret
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.760]   both and both interpret John.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.040]   One great message.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.920]   That's the proof that it's the word of God.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.740]   It's not human philosophising and theorising.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.200]   This is God's word to men.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.600]   Listen to Peter putting it.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.920]   He puts it like this, you see.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.600]   Be sober, he says.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   Be sober.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   Be vigilant, feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   Why?
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.240]   Well, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   he may devour.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.560]   How do you resist him?
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.640]   Whom resists steadfast in the faith.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   That's it.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.280]   Faith is the only way in which you meet these particular attacks.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.600]   John says exactly the same thing.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:42.280]   This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   That's it.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.800]   Faith is always the shield that you hold up to quench all these fiery darts of the wicked
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   one.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   But what's it mean?
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.840]   What's he mean here by faith?
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.960]   Now this is the practical point, isn't it?
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:04.080]   Faith means here the ability to apply quickly what we believe as an answer to everything
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.760]   the devil does or attempts to do to us.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.940]   That is what faith is.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.880]   Now this is most important.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.200]   Faith is not merely an intellectual belief or theory.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.340]   Of course, faith includes what you do believe, but faith never stops at mere intellectual
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.080]   assent and belief.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.040]   Faith always acts.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.920]   Faith is always practical.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.680]   Faith always applies the truth.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.280]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.840]   There is always this element of activity in faith.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.880]   Let's never forget that.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.000]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It's a practical thing.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.440]   There's an assurance always as an element in faith.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.720]   In other words, what the apostle is saying here is this, that when these fiery darts
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.840]   are hurled at you, there's only one thing you've got to do.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.680]   Take hold of your shield of faith.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:03.480]   Hold up faith, as it were, in this way against them, and they'll all be quenched.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:11.600]   So I define it as meaning this, the quick application of what we believe as an answer
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.040]   to everything that the devil does.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.600]   Now then, how does faith act as our shield?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:24.480]   Here's the question, and the answer is this.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.980]   And I know of nothing that is more important for the individual Christian in his battle
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.760]   than just this.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:40.400]   Faith never points to itself, but always points to its object.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.440]   Now that is absolutely crucial.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.680]   The cults today are trying to produce people who have got faith in faith.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.820]   If you put your faith in faith, you're done for.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.400]   Faith never points to itself.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.360]   It always points to an object.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.840]   There are people who are trying to work up faith, the quality of faith in themselves.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   They might as well stop.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   They'll never do it.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   That's coercion.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   That's purely psychological.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.640]   You're not told to work up faith.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.920]   You're not told to put your faith in faith.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.400]   It's absolutely fatal.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.440]   That is the whole teaching of the cults.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.040]   No, no, faith never points to itself.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.480]   Faith never protects a man in and of itself.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   What does it do then?
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.880]   Oh, faith always points to its object.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.720]   And that is how faith makes us strong.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.040]   This is a term that is used in the scripture with respect to faith, or if you like, with
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   respect to hope.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.440]   They both come to the same thing.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.440]   Listen to Paul putting it to the Romans in chapter 4.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.920]   He's talking about Abraham.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.600]   I begin to read at verse 18.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.080]   "Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.000]   according to that which was spoken, so shall they seed me."
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Now listen.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.440]   "And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead when he was about
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.000]   a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.360]   He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith."
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.760]   Now that's a bad translation.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.880]   It means was made strong by faith.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   How?
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.560]   Giving glory to God.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.000]   "And being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform, and
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.280]   therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.640]   Now you see how faith saved Abraham?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.800]   Faith saved Abraham by giving glory to God, by pointing to God.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   And that's what faith does.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.680]   It never points to itself.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.240]   Faith points to God.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:38.800]   The secret of Abraham was that his faith led him to God and God's character and promises.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.160]   He relied upon them and all was well.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.000]   Now that is how it always does it.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.240]   So we are told about the great heroes of the faith in Hebrews 11, 34, that out of weakness
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.400]   they were made strong.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   What did it?
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.400]   Faith.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.480]   But not faith in itself, faith in God.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.680]   That's the whole story of that eleventh of Hebrews.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.160]   These were men who believed God.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.020]   They accounted him able to do that which he had promised.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.020]   That was their secret.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.020]   Faith?
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.720]   Oh, let me get this clear.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.880]   Faith never turns in upon itself, so you shouldn't be looking at yourself and trying to cultivate
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.080]   faith in yourself as some quality.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.360]   No, no.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:24.540]   Faith points out from self to the object, to the great and the glorious object of itself.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.540]   And what is that?
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.580]   Well, I've already answered my question.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:34.520]   Faith always points to God, to the character of God.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   He's one on whom we can rely.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.600]   It points to his promises.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.200]   And oh, the Bible is full of them.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   Get to know them, my friends.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.360]   Then you'll be able to hold up the shield of faith.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.640]   The moment the enemy comes and the darts are flying, you'll be able to hold up a statement
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.680]   of the Scripture, a promise of God, and you know that he's true and faithful to his promise.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.560]   He's unchangeable.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.220]   He's the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.680]   So that when the devil comes to you and says, "All right, I believe, I'll grant you that
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.400]   God did bless you and he seemed to be your father, but you know he's no longer interested
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.560]   in you."
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.800]   And so you begin to despair.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.720]   But not if you've got the shield of faith.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.920]   You pull it up at once and you say, "But that's impossible.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.400]   God is the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.120]   He can't change what God said he will do.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.960]   His promises are ever sure.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.040]   He's taken an oath and he'll never break it."
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.720]   That's how you hold up the shield of faith.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.440]   And then you remember also the power of God.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.180]   And this is a very wonderful thing.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:45.280]   Because when the enemy sends about this barrage of fiery darts, or you feel so weak and frail,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.680]   you feel they're bound to hit you.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.240]   You're bound to be defeated.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   But then faith, the shield of faith, you hold it up and it points you straight to God and
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.880]   the power of God.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   And what do you remember?
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.880]   Well, you remember this.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.640]   "Abram, at a moment of weakness, he was tired out and exhausted after a great stand.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.920]   And the enemy began to attack him.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.880]   He said, 'Look here, what's the point of God blessing you like this?
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   You haven't got an heir.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.560]   You've got nobody to carry on the line.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.720]   What's the use of all these great promises of God and you haven't got a son?
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.280]   That Ishmael is not a son of yours.'
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.600]   And Abram was on the point of shaking.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.120]   God gave him the shield of faith and this was it.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.800]   'Fear not, Abraham.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.600]   I am thy shield and thine exceeding great reward.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.840]   I am thy shield.'"
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   That's it.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.120]   God's the shield and his power is endless and eternal.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:39.160]   "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time of trouble," says the 46th Psalm.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.000]   And the book of Proverbs adds, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.160]   The righteous runneth into it and is safe."
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.360]   That's the shield, the name of the Lord, the power of God.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:57.560]   "Yes," says David in Psalm 84, "the Lord God is a sun and shield."
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.680]   You see, you're hiding behind the power of God.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.120]   That's what faith makes you do.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.960]   Faith, the shield of faith, as it were, points you to the power of God and the moment you're
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.840]   behind that, all the fiery darts of the wicked one are quenched and come to nothing.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.040]   They can't touch them.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.360]   And remember, his power is eternal, illimitable.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.920]   Everlasting is the omnipotent God.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   Yet all the forces of hell come together.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.800]   They can't touch him.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.640]   Whom resist steadfast in the faith.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:34.360]   But not only God the Father, our blessed Lord and Saviour brings it to us still more definitely.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   His love for us in the past proves his interest in us.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.400]   Who can condemn us, says Paul to the Romans, it is Christ that died for us, yea, rather
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.800]   that he's risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   for us.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.320]   So when the devil hurls these darts and doubts at you, hurl that up.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.680]   Christ has proved his love to me by dying for me and rising again.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.560]   Then take this one.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.640]   He's been here in this world himself as a man.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.720]   The word was made flesh.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.500]   He came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.560]   He was tempted by the devil.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.860]   The devil hurled all his fiery darts.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.880]   He brought out all his reserves against him.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.240]   But he defeated him completely and routed him finally.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:31.080]   Remember that and remember that he is now seated at the right hand of God in power and
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.620]   that he's there as your representative and mine.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.380]   That he's there as it were to fight all our battles for us, waiting until his enemies
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.880]   are all finally made his footstool.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.220]   But remember this above everything.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.440]   In the heat of the battle and when the fiery darts come from every direction, remember
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:55.240]   that because he came into this world, because the incarnation is true, because he suffered
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.760]   fighting against sin even unto blood, remember that because he's been tempted like as we
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.360]   are, that he's able to sympathize with us when we are tempted.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.820]   We have not an high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:16.560]   but one who is tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.920]   Well remember this my dear friend.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.280]   You're not left to yourself.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.520]   He is with you.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.320]   You're in him and he is watching over you and caring for you.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.820]   He's given proof of his love by what he's done.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.720]   He's continuing it by what he's still doing.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   Shield of faith.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.160]   What does holding up the shield of faith mean?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:40.120]   It means reminding yourself of all this, looking to God the Father, God the Son, and God the
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.880]   Holy Spirit.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.520]   It means depending upon God and his grace in Christ.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:52.000]   It means that you link yourself in your mind and thought to him who has all power and who
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.620]   will enable us to be more than conquerors.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.720]   Holding up the shield of faith, what does it mean?
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:06.560]   Well, you know there are times when we are so hard pressed that we can do nothing but
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.040]   just manage to hold it up.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   You've felt that, haven't you?
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   You've known that.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.800]   Well, you're almost incapable of holding up the shield of faith but you can still do
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.600]   it and this is how you do it.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.640]   You say, "I need thee every hour.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.880]   Stay thou nearby.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.920]   Temptations lose their power when thou art nigh."
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.240]   That's all you can say.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.040]   You just desperately cry unto him, "Stay near.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   Stand by me."
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   And he will.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:38.360]   "I need thy presence every passing hour.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.040]   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?"
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   But it can.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   His can.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.860]   His grace is sufficient.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.960]   So we can say, "I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.040]   Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:01.120]   Where is death's sting, where grave thy victory?
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   I triumph still if thou abide with me."
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:15.760]   That's what it means to take up the shield of faith wherewith you are able to quench
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.280]   all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   Not just try to work up some kind of feeling called faith.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.680]   No, no.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:31.760]   Faith leads straight to the Almighty God who is our Saviour and who is a very present
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.200]   help in time of trouble.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:39.040]   Let us therefore go with boldness to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.120]   grace to help in time of need.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.000]   None of these darts need ever fix you or burn you or damage you or get you down.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.320]   Build up the shield of faith, whom resist steadfast in the faith.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:04.040]   May God enable us to understand this teaching and to implement it whenever the enemy comes
