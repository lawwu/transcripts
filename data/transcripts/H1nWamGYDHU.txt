[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.840]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the eighth chapter, and I'm going to read from
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.320]   verse four to verse twelve. Now we are looking at this because it is a very wonderful account
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.640]   and a very historical account of how the Christian faith, the Christian message, and the Christian
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.200]   church first spread. We are living in days when we are witnessing the opposite, so it's
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   good for us to be reminded of how it was that the Christian church from a very small beginning,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.160]   almost infinitesimally small, began to spread and to develop until it is now something that
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.680]   which is known in every country throughout the world. I'm calling attention to it in
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.640]   order that we may acquaint ourselves with these historical facts and events. I'm doing
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.000]   so particularly because there is such confusion today as to what Christianity is. And that's
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.440]   why, of course, so many are outside the Christian church and Christian people have become a
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.200]   remnant in this country and in many other countries. It is because of this confusion,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.400]   which alas, is not only existent outside the church, but unfortunately inside the church
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.600]   also. So I'm calling attention to this because here we have authentic Christianity. If you
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.920]   really want to know what Christianity is, well you've got to come back to this book.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.040]   I mean the whole of the New Testament, this book of the Acts, perhaps in particular just
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.520]   at the present time. It doesn't matter what people think about Christianity. We can all
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.680]   think and people have their opinions, they say, "Oh, I say it's this and that," but there's
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.600]   no value in that, there's no sanction. This is how it happened. This is the real thing.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.680]   This is how the Christian church began. You see, all our troubles today are due to the
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.360]   fact that instead of going back to the beginning, we start from where we are. We start with
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.920]   an institution. Instead of going back and discovering what the church is, what the gospel
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.520]   is, what the real message is. Well now, here we are told it very simply and very plainly.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.000]   You see, this world of ours is the scene of a great spiritual conflict. It's described
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   here. Saul was consenting unto his death, the death of Stephen, and at that time there
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.280]   was a great persecution against the church which was that Jerusalem. And they were all
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.000]   scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles. Saul
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.160]   made havoc of the church, entering into every house and hailing men and women, committed
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.720]   them to prison. What's that due to? That's due to the devil, to the power and the forces
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.080]   of evil. And that's what I mean when I say that this world of ours is the scene of a
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.000]   mighty spiritual conflict. The power of God and the forces of God, the power of the devil
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.720]   and of evil and of hell. And there's no adequate explanation of the state of this world tonight
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   but just that. And then we've looked at it as it's seen in the life of these people living
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.920]   in Samaria, almost worshipping a sorcerer. That's the world. It'll take any man at his
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.240]   own valuation. If he says he's a god, they'll accept him as one. We've lived in an age,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.800]   remember, let us never forget this, in a century when almost worship was accorded to a man
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.760]   like Hitler and to others. And it's being done still. That's the kind of world in which
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480]   we are living. The world doesn't change. It was like that in the first century, it's like
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:55.520]   that now. Devil, possession and illness and sickness and pain and sorrow, that's our world.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.440]   And here it is. And the great question is now, can anything be done for this? Well,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:09.400]   the world as we've seen turns to its false remedies, its false prophets, these sorcerers.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.680]   But they can't help us. They can delude us for a while, but they can't help us, they
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.200]   can't deliver us. There's only one thing that can. And what we're told here is what that
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.320]   one thing is and how it does it. You see, we were looking last Sunday night, you remember.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.120]   "Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word." This
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.800]   is the Christian message. And we have seen it's a very definite word. It's a distinct
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.960]   word. It's a word that can be defined. It can be stated. You can know exactly what it
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   is. A Christian is not a man who's seeking after truth. He's a man who's founded. He
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.080]   knows it. And he can tell you what it is. He can give you a reason for the hope that
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.160]   is in him. Here were ordinary people, not the apostles even, scattered abroad, yet they
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.040]   went everywhere preaching the word. They knew exactly what they'd got to say. They'd got
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   a message and they felt that they had to deliver it. Philip, we're told, goes down to Samaria
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.840]   and he proclaims it. He's a deacon in the church, an official man, so he proclaims it
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:23.800]   boldly and openly. Well now, we've seen that this is good news, the gospel. And if this
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.960]   doesn't come to us as good news, my dear friend, it isn't Christianity. This is the best good
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.560]   news that has ever come into the world. What is it? Well, we ended last Sunday night by
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.840]   putting it like this. It is about the kingdom of God. What does that mean? It means this,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.320]   that God has not abandoned this world. It looks at times as if he has, but he hasn't.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.080]   His word tells us that. He permits things to happen in it, and he even does that for
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.800]   our good. Because, you see, when men refuse the offer of this gospel, and when they think
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   they're too clever to believe it any longer, and when they're confident that they can manage
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.480]   themselves and their world without God, well, when men reject God's gospel, well, God just
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.080]   hands them over to themselves for a while. He's often done this before. And whenever
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.920]   he does that, what you always get is chaos. The chaos we've got today. The lawlessness,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:27.080]   the godlessness, the violence, the drug-taking, all the rest of it. That's men left to himself.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.640]   But you see, this doesn't mean that God has finally abandoned this world. He hasn't.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   This whole message of the kingdom of God that Philip preached, and as I showed you, that
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.080]   the Lord himself had preached, that all these disciples and apostles preached, the kingdom
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   of God, what is it? Well, it's a great message, and this is why it's such wonderful good news,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.760]   that we are not left to ourselves. If we were to be left to ourselves, finally, this world
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.360]   would become hell. It's approximating to it now, but it would become hell. But God is
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.600]   concerned. It's still his world. And he is setting up his own kingdom in this world.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   He's been doing it throughout the centuries. The church is an expression of it. It gathers
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.600]   people out individually, takes hold of them in the darkness, and translates them into
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.240]   the kingdom of light and of his dear son, the kingdom of God. And he's going on with
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.040]   this until the kingdoms of this world shall have become the kingdom of God and of his
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.680]   Christ. That's our great message. So whatever the news may be, whatever the historians and
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.640]   the philosophers may say, we know that ultimately there shall be a new heavens and a new earth
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.920]   wherein dwelleth righteousness. The kingdom of God shall cover the whole earth as the
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:00.000]   waters cover the sea. Well now, the question before us is this, how does God do this? And
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.560]   that's the thing to which I want to call your attention in particular this evening.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:12.720]   How does he do this? How is this great plan and purpose of God carried out? What was the
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.240]   specific message that the ordinary Christians preached by gossiping, whenever they were,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.000]   and that Philip preached in some area? Well the answer is here quite simply. Philip went
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.680]   down into the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them. Or as it was put in the
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.600]   twelfth verse, you notice, "When they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.480]   kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ." Now this is the thing that he preached. And
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:54.080]   this is of course the specific and the special message of the Christian faith. He preached
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   Christ to them. He preached the name of Jesus Christ. Now what does this mean? Let's try
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.440]   to put ourselves back in this position. Let's try to imagine what it was exactly that Philip
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.920]   said to these people in this city of Samaria. Because then we shall know exactly what the
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.080]   Christian message is. This is what we are told, he preached Christ to them. He preached
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:30.780]   the name of Jesus Christ. Now let me put it negatively like this. He didn't merely preach
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:38.060]   to them about God, he did preach about God. But he didn't leave it at that. Why not? Well,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:45.120]   you see these Samaritans already believed in God. The Jews believed in God. The Samaritans
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.920]   believed in God. To believe in God alone doesn't make us Christian. Now many people seem to
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.480]   think that it does. People tell me, "I've always believed in God." As if that means
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   they're Christians. But you can believe in God and not be a Christian. The Jew does,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.640]   the Mohammedan does, all sorts of people do. That doesn't make us Christian. No, no, we
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.240]   can't invest time over that. The one thing that makes us Christian is our relationship
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:21.720]   to this Christ. Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ. He's the beginning and the end, the
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:28.220]   center of the Christian message. Now you noticed how the Apostle Paul put that in his own way
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.440]   in reminding the Corinthians in that first letter of what it was he had first done when
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.240]   he went amongst them. He says, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:49.120]   Christ and him crucified." Let me say it again. Christianity is not just a bit of idealism,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.680]   it's not pacifism, it's not just a do-goodism, it's not a moral uplift, it's not thinking
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:04.640]   beautiful thoughts. It's Jesus Christ, the person. And if you're not clear about that,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.500]   you haven't started even considering what the Christian message is. It is all in this
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:17.720]   blessed person. "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ." We
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.000]   preach Christ crucified. That's the message. Well now then, the question before us is,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.080]   what does this mean? People use his name, but they use it just to cover the kind of
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.840]   thing I've been indicating, a moral uplift, an idealism, or an objection to certain things
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.600]   that are being done in the world. But that isn't it. What do you think Philip said?
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.320]   He went and preached Christ. He told them about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:58.360]   Christ. His name, the name stands for power, it stands for authority, it stands for everything
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.120]   that is done by this person. You remember how we are told in the third chapter about
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.080]   Peter and John going up into the temple to pray at the ninth hour, being the hour of
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:14.880]   prayer. And how they suddenly saw this poor fellow, born lame, over forty years of age,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   sitting on the pavement outside the beautiful gate of the temple. And he looked up at them
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.960]   expecting to receive alms of them. But they hadn't got any. And do you remember what happened?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.560]   They fixed their eyes on him and they looked at him and they said, "Peter said, 'Silver
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:35.520]   and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:43.080]   Nazareth, rise up and walk!'" And his feet and his ankle bones received strength. Peter
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.000]   held out his hand to him. He sprang up. And there he is going into the temple, walking
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.440]   and leaping and praising God. What had done it? Well, the people thought that Peter and
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.040]   John had done it. And they went crowding round them. They were ready to worship them. The
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.760]   world is always ready to worship men. The world is always religious. And when it ceases
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:06.680]   to worship God, it begins to worship men, as it worshipped Simon Magus in Samaria. The
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.600]   world was ready many times to worship these various apostles. We are given the account
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.200]   of it in this book. Peter said, "Don't worship us. Don't think that we ourselves, by any
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:23.560]   godliness or power in ourselves, have done this thing. His name, through faith in his
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:31.720]   name, hath given these men this perfect soundness in the presence of you all." Who is this?
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:38.600]   Well, he told them, "He is the Prince of Life, the Author of Life." Well, now, this is the
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.040]   message. You see, that's what Philip preached about. Have you ever heard the Christian Gospel?
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.600]   Do you really know what it is? I'm addressing those of you, especially, who have rejected
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.720]   it, as you think, and who say, "You're not a Christian," and perhaps are proud of the
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.880]   fact that you're not a Christian. Do you know what you're rejecting? Do you know what this
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.280]   message about Christ, about Jesus Christ, really is? Well, let's go back, I say. Let's
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.600]   imagine that we're listening to Philip. What did he say? Well, he began talking about a
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:17.400]   person, Jesus. He said, "Listen, I've got something to say to you. I want to tell you,"
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.200]   he said, "about someone whose name was Jesus." And he began to tell them about him. What
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.800]   did he tell them? Well, he gave them, undoubtedly, a resume of what you and I can read in the
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.040]   pages of the four Gospels. He said, "Now, I want to tell you about a man called Jesus
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.520]   of Nazareth." He said, "You may have heard about him already. Samaria wasn't so far away,
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.240]   and these things had become known." So he began to tell them about this extraordinary
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.760]   person, Jesus, who'd worked as a carpenter until the age of 30, and then began to go
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.360]   around preaching and teaching, and doing various other things. "I want to tell you about him,"
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.240]   says Philip. And what did he tell them about him? Well, he said, "I want to tell you about
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:15.040]   the way in which he was born." He said, "You know, we've got a record and an account of
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:26.400]   this. There are people who knew his mother, and she's told them of how, quite unexpectedly,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   she was suddenly visited by an archangel, who greeted her, and told her that she was
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:40.080]   highly favored amongst women, because she was going to bear a child, a holy child, a
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.520]   holy thing, who was to inherit the kingdom of his father David, and to reign in it without
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.840]   end, forever and forever." She couldn't understand. But the angel explained to her.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.720]   She said, "How can I? I've never known a man. How can I bear a child? I'm not married.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:04.400]   Impossible." And he said to her, "The Holy Ghost will come upon you, and you are going
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.960]   to conceive of the Holy Ghost." She didn't understand. She marveled. She was amazed.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:16.400]   But the archangel said, "With God, nothing shall be impossible. Don't talk of impossibilities.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.480]   God is doing this to you. This is a part of God's great plan of bringing in his kingdom,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.560]   and you are to have this great honor of bearing the Son of God in your womb, and giving birth
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   to him on his birthday." This is the part of the message. It's all here in the Gospel.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.640]   And then, you see, he went on to tell them of how this child grew. He was an amazing
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.720]   child. There was something always unusual about him. They went up when he was twelve
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.440]   years of age, up to Jerusalem on a feast occasion, and they'd finished their business and were
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.280]   going home, and they assumed that he was in the company. Now suddenly, having traveled
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   about two days, they looked for him and couldn't find him. So they were perturbed, and they
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.440]   went rushing back. And when they got back to Jerusalem, they found him in the temple
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:10.000]   talking and discussing with the doctors of the law, and able to refute them and confute
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   them and confound them with his learning and his knowledge. A boy of twelve. But then he
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.240]   went back and just went on with his work as a carpenter until he was thirty, and then
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:29.360]   he suddenly began to preach and to teach. He went to John the Baptist and asked him
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.040]   to baptize him, and John said, "You ought to be baptizing me." "No," he said, "you
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   baptize me. Thus it behoves us to fulfill all righteousness." And as he was coming
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.480]   up out of the water, the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove descended upon him, and there
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.720]   was a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   And he began to teach. And it was astonishing. He'd never had any training, but he spoke
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.440]   with authority. Everybody recognized him. The people listening to him said, "This
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.680]   man speaketh with authority, not as the Pharisees and scribes." "Here was one," said Philip,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.640]   "you know, he confounded the authorities, all these great and learned doctors of the
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.360]   law. He had an understanding which none of them possessed, and they couldn't—" "How
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.240]   was this man learning?" they said, "Never having learned." They could not understand
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.160]   it, and yet they couldn't answer him. And he expounded the law of God, and spoke about
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.280]   the coming kingdom of God. He uttered parables, he told stories, he said, "The kingdom of
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.080]   God, the kingdom of heaven is like this, and it's like that." And he spoke as one with
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:41.480]   authority, and everybody listened to him. In addition to that, he worked extraordinary
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:49.080]   miracles. The blind received their sight, the lame began to walk, the deaf were made
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.960]   to hear, the lepers were cleansed, and he could even raise the dead. Now these are historical
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.360]   events. They caused trouble, they caused annoyance. People were opposed to him because of this.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.400]   Nevertheless, he did all these things. "But," said Philip, "what I really want to tell
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.440]   you is this. Here is this amazing teacher. Here is this man with this extraordinary power,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   who can silence the wind and calm the raging sea. One who seems to have all power and all
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:28.640]   authority." Yet, he was arrested and he was tried. He didn't answer. He took it all without
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.080]   complaint. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. They condemned him, and they nailed him to
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:41.360]   a tree, and in apparent utter weakness, he just died. People watching him said, "Look
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.200]   here, you said you were the son of God. You said you could save others. Why don't you
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.000]   save yourself? If you're the son of God, come down from that tree. Give us proof that you're
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.400]   the son of God." He didn't. He died in a very short time. The soldiers looking on were amazed.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.800]   Crucifixion was a very slow form of death. The result was that generally, when they crucified
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.120]   men, they used to put them to death after a certain time to relieve them of their terrible
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   suffering. But when they went to look at this person who was crucified between two thieves,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:24.160]   they were amazed to find that he was already dead. They buried him in a grave. They thought
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.320]   that that was the end. The authorities were very pleased. "But you know," said Philip,
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.240]   "it wasn't the end. And that's why I'm here, and that's why I'm speaking to you. It wasn't
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:40.720]   the end." Some of our people went, those who'd been following, went to see the grave the morning
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:48.000]   of the third day, and the stone had been removed. And they looked in, and he wasn't there. He
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.800]   disappeared out of the grave. What was this? "Oh, he'd risen out of it," said Philip, "because
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.920]   afterwards he appeared and he showed himself to some of these men whom I'd been living
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.360]   with and working with. We called them apostles," said Philip. "He revealed themselves. They
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.560]   were astonished. They couldn't believe it. A man called Thomas amongst them said, 'I
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.000]   won't believe this unless I actually put my finger into the imprint of the nails and thrust
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.400]   my fist into his side. I won't believe it.' And then he had to see it, and he fell at
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.320]   his feet and said, 'My Lord and my God.'" "Now," said Philip, "I want to tell you about
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:31.560]   this one. I want to tell you about this Jesus of Nazareth, because can't you see," said
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.320]   Philip, "there's only one explanation of this person, and that is that he is the Son of
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:45.800]   God. No one before has risen from the dead. There have been cases of resuscitation. He
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.480]   did it himself. He did it to a friend of his called Lazarus. He did it to the son of a
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.720]   poor widow in a place called Nain. He'd got this power. That was resuscitation. Here is
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.880]   one who has risen from the dead. This is resurrection." "Now," said Philip, "I want to tell you about
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:11.000]   this person, because this proves that he is the Son of God." Now this was apostolic preaching.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.880]   They preached Jesus and the resurrection. Now it is perfectly clear from all the records.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.320]   They would never have preached at all were it not for the resurrection. They would have
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.960]   come to the conclusion that this Jesus, after all, was only a teacher like everybody else.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.600]   He had claimed that he was more than that. He had said, 'The Father and I are one,'
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.640]   and he'd given this great demonstration of power. But they would have said, 'Well, of
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.680]   course, we thought that he was going to be the deliverer, but he wasn't. He died and
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   was crucified in utter weakness, and that was the end. We were wrong. He was only a
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:52.560]   man after all. You know, the resurrection finally proved that he was the Son of God.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:23:00.360]   I want to tell you about him,' said Philip. Why? Why is he so important? Why did he preach
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:07.720]   Christ to them? Why did he preach Jesus Christ? Well, you see, the answer is this. If this
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.240]   is the Son of God, as Philip said he was, the question is, why did he come into this
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:21.960]   world? Why was he born of a virgin? Why did he rise from the dead? Why did the Son of
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.160]   God ever come into this world? Here is the crucial question. Well, of course, he's answered
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.720]   the question himself. He said, 'The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.040]   is lost.' He said, 'The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   to give his life a ransom for many.' He kept on saying this. But now here's the question.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.800]   What does it mean, 'to save'? You know, the word here says, 'He preached Christ to them.'
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.640]   And that is just the Greek word for the Hebrew word which was 'Messiah.' What's this? Well,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.880]   you see, if you read your Old Testament, this is something that you'll find running right
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.160]   through the whole of your Old Testament. God gave a promise way back right at the beginning
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:17.800]   that he was going to do something about the deliverance of this world. He gave a promise.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.840]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. The Old Testament is a book of promise.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.400]   God gave a promise to Abram. He repeated it to Isaac. He repeated it to Jacob. He repeated
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.200]   it to Moses. He repeated it to David. You get it being thundered forth by all that great
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.440]   succession of prophets. 'Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.' Why? 'While
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.120]   a deliverer, a Messiah, a Christ is going to come, God is going to send the deliverer.'
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   This is the message. The Christ, the deliverer, the Saviour. Now, the Jews were all looking
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:59.280]   forward to this, and so were the Samaritans. If you like to read when you go home tonight
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.320]   the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, you'll find the record of a conversation
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:11.640]   between the Lord Jesus Christ and the woman of Samaria. And there you'll find very clearly
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.560]   that she and all Samaritans were looking forward to a deliverer. 'The woman saith unto him,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.480]   I know that Messiah's cometh which is called Christ. When he is come, he will tell us all
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.680]   things.' These Samaritans, as I've explained on a previous Sunday evening, were very muddled,
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.800]   they were very confused, they were very ignorant. But there was one thing they'd held on to,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:40.720]   the promise of a coming deliverer. There was someone to come who was going to deliver the
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.760]   world from its terrible predicament, and they were waiting for him. Now that's the meaning
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:53.560]   of 'to save'. And this is the great theme of the Christian Gospel. 'So no man is come
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.040]   to seek and to save that which is lost.' Or take the way the author of the epistle to
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:07.840]   the Hebrews puts it. He says here, 'How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?'
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.940]   Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, this Jesus, he began to preach a message
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:20.280]   of salvation. At the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.960]   them that heard him. This is the message. It's all about this salvation. But what is
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.280]   salvation? What's it mean? Now this is the thing that Philip had to explain to these
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   people in Samaria. It's all very well to say that God's Son has come into this world, but
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.360]   why has he come? What has he come for? Well he says himself he's come to seek and to save,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.640]   but says somebody, 'What does it mean? Do I need to be saved? What is it to be saved?
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.520]   What is salvation? What's it all about?' Now here's the thing you see that the world isn't
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.360]   considering today. Here unfortunately is the thing even the church isn't considering. Christianity
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:02.920]   has just become, well I must say it again, a protest against war and bombs and apartheid.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.960]   And you'd think that that's the whole of it, something political, but it isn't. It's salvation!
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:17.800]   What is salvation? Great salvation! Well, Philip explained it to them. He said, 'Have
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:26.200]   you ever realized your need and your true state and condition? Do you realize,' said
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:34.400]   Philip, 'that you're all under the wrath of God because of your rebellion against him,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.800]   because you've broken his holy laws? Why are you as you are? Why is your world as it is?
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:48.280]   The answer is that you're at enmity with God, and God's wrath is upon you.' Now this was
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.680]   what they all preached. Paul says to the Romans, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.960]   for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.240]   and also to the Greek, for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:11.640]   faith as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.' For the wrath of God against all
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:20.400]   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men is already revealed from him.' The wrath of God
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.960]   is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.040]   My dear friends, you don't begin to understand this world in which we are living. You don't
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   begin to understand your own experience of misery and wretchedness until you realize
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.240]   that God, instead of loving you and smiling upon you and showering his blessings upon
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:50.480]   you, has put his wrath upon you. The world tonight is just a manifestation of the wrath
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.000]   of God. And as I said just now, a part of the manifestation of that wrath is that God
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.640]   just leaves us to ourselves. God hates sin. God is light and in him is no darkness at
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.560]   all. And he made us for himself. And when we rebel against him he will punish us. He
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.280]   said so. He came down and said so to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. He said so
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.360]   ever since. He has given us a law which brings this home to us and he tells us exactly how
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.880]   he hates it. We are all, every one of us, under the wrath of God. Now you may not like
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.680]   that but that's not the question. That is the position. God is displeased with you.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:43.240]   And did you know this, my friend? If you die like that, you'll go on to eternal misery.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:50.600]   That's the punishment of sin. The wages of sin is death. Spiritual death, separation
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:30:00.800]   from God, physical death, and beyond it misery, without interlude, without any relief. I'm
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:08.480]   not saying this. The Son of God said it. It's he who spoke about divies in hell. It is he
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.360]   who spoke of a place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. What do
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   you know about these things? You say you don't believe in hell. On what grounds don't you
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:25.720]   believe in hell? What do we know about life after death? We know nothing except what we
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:32.640]   are told here. And this is what he taught. And this is what Philip taught. So you see,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.320]   we are as we are and there is that terrible prospect. Because we are living a life without
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.920]   God. We've defied him. We've stood up to him. We've deliberately floated his laws.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.360]   We've spat upon all that he regards as sacred and holy. And the wrath of God is upon us
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:56.640]   and we need to be delivered from it. And not only that, by our rebellion and the breaking
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:03.920]   of God's law, we've put ourselves under the dominion of the devil, of sin and of evil.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.640]   I needn't keep you. I've expounded that before. Look at these wretched people in some area.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.600]   I can imagine and I can hear Philip saying to them, "Why do you believe in this sorcerer?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.440]   Why are some of your people devil-possessed? Why is there this misery, this unhappiness,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.600]   this wretchedness, this heartbreak? What's the cause of it?" He said, "It's because you're
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.400]   the slaves of sin. You're the slaves of the devil." "I know," said Philip. "You say, you
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.880]   know, men have always said, 'I can give that up whenever I like.' Well, then the answer
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.800]   is, 'Why don't you do it?' I've heard men saying, 'I can give up this, I can give up
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.480]   that.' Why don't they do it? When they're made wretched themselves, when they make others
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.920]   wretched, if you can, why don't you? If you can stop sinning, why don't you stop sinning?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:57.640]   You can't help it. Why? Because you're a slave of sin and a slave of the devil." That's the
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.160]   teaching of the whole of the Old Testament. It was the teaching that Philip gave to these
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.200]   people. He says, "This is what salvation means, that you need to be delivered out of all this,
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   delivered from being under the wrath of God, delivered from hell. How shall we escape if
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:25.400]   we neglect so great salvation? Eternal punishment, and everlastingly under the thralldom and
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:34.880]   the tyranny of evil and sin and lust and passion and foulness and all that is wrong." That's
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:42.120]   what he means. Very well. Listen, said Philip, "I want to tell you about this Jesus. He is
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:49.080]   the Christ. He is the Savior." "I've got good news to give you," says Philip. "You're helpless
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.600]   in the grip of sin. You can't shake it off. You can't deliver yourselves. You can't do
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.840]   anything about putting yourselves right with God. You've tried many of you, but you can't do it.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:06.040]   We all fail. I fail," says Philip, "We're all failures. I've come to tell you that God is saving
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.080]   us himself, and he's done so in the person of this Jesus Christ." Listen, "Jesus," he says,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:18.440]   "is the Christ, the deliverer, the promised Messiah." How does he say it? And then Philip
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:25.760]   went on to tell them. He said, "Listen, I've told you the facts about his life. I now want
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:33.840]   to explain to you," said Philip, "the meaning of those facts." How does he say this? Well,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:41.880]   the first thing is, his very coming into this world is a part of this great salvation. We are
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.960]   not saved by a word from heaven. A word from heaven was enough to create the universe. It
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:55.800]   isn't enough to save us. The Son of God had to come into the world before we could be saved.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:01.000]   That's the meaning of the incarnation. And you see, in coming into the world at all,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.680]   he's already starting the process of delivering us, because what does it mean? Well, the apostle
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.360]   Paul puts it later in these terms. He said, "He was made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:18.440]   to redeem them that are under the law." In other words, it's this. He came into the world in order
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:26.360]   to identify himself with us. He is the eternal Son of God, but we are men and women, we are flesh and
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:38.440]   blood. We are born of women. And in order to save us, he had to identify himself with us. As Son of
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:46.880]   God in his glory, he couldn't save us, because we are human, flesh and blood. So he came down.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:55.360]   He laid aside all the signs of his eternal glory. He emptied himself of all that. He humbled himself.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:02.440]   He made himself of no reputation. And he was born as that helpless babe. What was he doing? He was
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:08.240]   taking our nature upon himself. He was standing by our side, and he went on doing it. That's
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.440]   why, as I told you just now, he went and got baptized by John the Baptist. John said, "You
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.160]   don't need to be baptized. You've never broken any law. You've never done any wrong. You don't
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.880]   need to be baptized." He said, "I do. I must. I can't fulfill all righteousness without doing it."
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.600]   You see, he not only came down and became a man like us, he's identified himself with us in our
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:35.040]   sin and in our unworthiness. He's insisted upon being baptized, which was a confession of sin,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:43.840]   repentance, though he had never sinned at all. That's what he did, said Philip. But wait a
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:52.240]   minute. That doesn't save us either. He then went on to live a perfect life. He rendered a perfect
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:36:01.800]   obedience to God and to God's law. He never sinned. He never did any wrong. Oh, he was tempted. He was
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.840]   tempted in all points like as we are. He never sinned. The devil brought out all his reserves
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.240]   against him. He tempted him in the most devilish manner that even the devil could produce. He
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:22.600]   didn't fall. He resisted all temptation. He rendered a perfect obedience to God's holy law
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   in every jot and tittle and every detail. It was a perfect obedience. At the same time, he conquered
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:41.400]   the devil. He conquered all the forces of the devil and of hell and of evil. And on top of it
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:50.200]   all, he even conquered death in the grave. He couldn't be holden by death. He died. They took
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.240]   down the body. They buried it in the grave. They rolled a stone on the grave and sealed it and put
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.560]   soldiers to guard it. He burst asunder the banners of death, the last enemy that should be conquered,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:08.640]   his death, he's conquered him, the last enemy. He has defeated every power that is against us.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:19.680]   That is how he saves us. That is how he delivers us. But wait a minute. I can imagine certain
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.080]   people saying to Philip at this point, as there are probably many wanting to ask me the same
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:34.200]   question now. If you say that this Jesus is the Son of God, if he is this heavenly being who has
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   come down on earth to dwell in order to save us, why did he have to die? I can understand he's
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.000]   living a perfect life. I see value in that. But why did he die? Why was he allowed to die? Why
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.520]   didn't he exert his great power and escape to heaven? All right, you're not the first who's
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:57.920]   thought of that. Some of his own closest followers and disciples felt he ought to do that and were
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.000]   urging him to do that. And he replied saying, "If I wanted to, I could. I could commend twelve
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.680]   legions of angels and I could be washed into heaven. I could defeat these. Elijah went to
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.560]   heaven without dying, so could I. But you know," he says, "I couldn't do my work if I did that."
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:23.840]   Your question has already been anticipated. You know the very center of the message that
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   Philip preached was the death of Christ. Paul says, "I determine not to know anything among
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:38.080]   you save Jesus Christ and him crucified." Now he did that, though he knew that that message was a
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.760]   stumbling block to the Jews. To them, the idea that of the Messiah, the Deliverer, dies a death
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.840]   of weakness upon a cross was scandalous. It was ridiculous. And of course to the sophisticated
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.560]   philosophical Greeks, this was the height of folly. That just a carpenter in a little land
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.400]   like Palestine who'd never been to the schools and the academies, that he says, and especially
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:07.120]   by dying on a cross. It is utter foolishness, rubbish, ridiculous. Nevertheless, says Paul,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:15.600]   we preach Christ crucified. And to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:22.880]   But unto us which are saved, Christ the power of God and Christ the wisdom of God. It isn't even
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.280]   by his perfect life that he saves us. That's a part of it. But you know there was something
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:38.800]   still essential, the death. That is why he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. That is why
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:45.920]   he went deliberately to his death. That's why he said that he had come in order to go to that hour.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.960]   Why is the death of Christ essential to your salvation and mine? And here is the answer.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:40:03.080]   It is because of the holiness and the justice and the righteousness of God. There was no other way.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.880]   God had already said that the soul that sinneth it shall die. He said that sin must be punished.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:16.480]   You know, shall I say it with reverence, God has no choice in this matter. Because God is light
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:23.200]   and because God is justice and holiness and righteousness and truth, he must hate sin. He
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:32.720]   must punish sin. And he says he will. And he's done so and will continue to do so. God can't
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:41.680]   wink at sin. You and I with our loose, flabby, sentimental ideas of love, we think that love
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.880]   is unrighteous, that it just pretends it hasn't sinned. We don't believe in discipline, do we?
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:53.240]   And that's why you've got your lightning strikes and your disorder and your lack of faithfulness
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.760]   in your trades union and you've got no discipline in your schools or in your homes and the whole
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:07.960]   of life has become chaos. It's because we have no conception of a holy love and a righteous and a
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   just love. But God is holy and is righteous and God can't pretend that he hasn't seen sin and
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.520]   God can't just brush it under the carpet. It's impossible. God's nature demands punishment for
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:30.320]   sin. God must remain eternally consistent with himself. And God has taught us this throughout
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.720]   the centuries. He taught the Samaritans this. They've got the five books of Moses. He taught
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:43.320]   the Jews this. You read there about burnt offerings and sacrifices. You read there that God commended
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.280]   Moses to build a temple. And they were to offer a lamb morning and evening. There were other
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.040]   offerings. Beasts were to be taken. They were to put their hands on their heads and then to slay
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:59.160]   them, take the blood, offer it to God. What's the meaning of all this? Is this all nonsense? No,
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:05.520]   no. This is God's revelation. This is God saying there is no remission of sins without shedding
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:13.560]   of blood. Justice must be revealed and manifested. Sin must be punished. There is no forgiveness
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:22.920]   without righteousness. God would not be God if he didn't say that. This is all my feeble way of what
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:30.720]   the Apostle Paul puts in these magnificent words. Being justified freely by his grace through the
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:36.840]   redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:42.240]   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that have passed through the
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:50.240]   forbearance of God, to declare, I say at this time, his righteousness that he might be just and the
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:58.480]   justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. My dear friend, the greatest problem that has ever
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:07.960]   confronted God is the problem of forgiving a single sinner. God's law must be honored. God's
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:15.680]   nature must be vindicated. Sin must be punished. Well, very well, if sin must be punished and the
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.560]   punishment of sin is death, how can any one of us ever be forgiven? How can any one of us ever be
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:28.000]   saved? And now I see Philip applying his message. How are you to be saved? You're all mortal beings.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.760]   You're going to die. It's appointed unto all men once to die and after death the judgment, and you've
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.600]   got to stand before God. And you're sinners. How can you? The wrath of God is on you. The law of
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:43.640]   God condemns you. Is there any hope? God's law must be vindicated. How can it happen? God must
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:50.320]   punish sin. How can you be forgiven? Listen, said Philip, that's why I've come amongst you. I've got
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:44:00.920]   the most amazing good news to give you. God has already punished your sin, and because he's
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:11.680]   punished it, he's offering you free pardon and forgiveness. Do you know that this Jesus is God's
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:19.720]   Lamb? You've heard of John the Baptist, he said, that fiery prophet in the wilderness. Do you
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.960]   remember what he said one day as he was standing with two of his disciples by his side? They'd been
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.040]   hanging on the words of John, they were ready to worship him, and he'd had to rebuke them and said,
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.600]   "I'm not the Christ. Not fit to undo the lecher of Yeshua. I'm only a little bit of a forerunner."
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:42.800]   "No, no," he said, "behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world." Here he is.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.080]   He has the fulfillment of all the prophecies. Here is the fulfillment of all the types of the burnt
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.040]   offerings and the sacrifices, and all the lambs. These are but shadows, adumbrations, foretellings.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:01.200]   Here is God's own Lamb and he's God's own Son. He sent him into the world to take away your sins.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:08.000]   He's laid on him the iniquity of us all. God has vindicated his honor, his justice, his righteousness.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:17.040]   He's punished sin. That's why Christ died. The wrath of God came upon him and it literally broke
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.880]   his heart. And that's why he died so much sooner than they thought he would. It was the agony of
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:32.320]   bearing the punishment of your sins and mine. It killed him. He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:42.240]   He has borne our sins in his own body on the tree. The punishment has been meted out. God has
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:51.040]   vindicated his own justice and his own righteousness. He has dealt with sin as he said he would deal
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:59.920]   with sin. But because he has dealt with it in the person of his only begotten beloved Son,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:11.280]   he offers you free pardon and forgiveness. "You have but to believe this," said Philip,
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.720]   "to these Samaritans and you're immediately forgiven." This is what I want to tell you.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:23.160]   Give up trying to put yourselves right, you'll never do it. You can fast and sweat and pray.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:31.480]   You can go into a monastery like Martin Luther went and be a monk. You'll never get assurance
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:37.120]   of forgiveness of sins. You'll never be able to reconcile yourselves with God. "Listen," says
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.320]   Philip, "this is amazing good news. That's why I've come down from Jerusalem to tell you and I
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:48.040]   want you to listen. There is only one hope for you and that is that you believe that Jesus of
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.600]   Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God and that he came into the world to save sinners,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:00.880]   that he came into the world to save you. That you realize your loss, that you confess it to God,
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:07.120]   which means repentance, that you see your lost estate, your helplessness, you see the terrible
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:12.440]   plight you're in and you see the jaws of hell as it were waiting and open to receive you and
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:27.320]   you can do nothing. But I want you to know that God offers free pardon and forgiveness to anyone
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   who acknowledges this sin and helplessness and believes the message concerning his own
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:38.400]   bearer of son. See this is the thing that not only sent Philip to Samaria, this is the thing
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.240]   that thrilled the great heart of that Apostle Paul. "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." Why?
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.520]   Well it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.360]   also to the Greek. Therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:48:02.480]   written, "The just shall live by faith." It's the man who lives by faith who's justified,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.840]   it is the man who believes the message concerning Jesus Christ, Son of God, coming into the world
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:19.720]   to die for our sins and to reconcile us unto God. Listen, says Paul again, we are ambassadors for
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:33.440]   Christ as though Christ did beseech you by us. We beseech you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:46.160]   to God. For God was in and through Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:58.840]   their trespasses unto them. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:08.560]   be made the righteousness of God in him. Oh, believe in this Christ. The moment you do so,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:14.360]   your sins are forgiven. Not only that, this perfect obedience of his will be put to your
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:19.800]   credit, to your account. The scripture puts that and the hymn-writers are so fond of that in terms
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:25.640]   of being clothed with the robe of righteousness. And you are unable to say, "Jesus, thy blood and
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:32.680]   righteousness, my beauty are, my glorious dress, midst flaming worlds in this arrayed, with joy
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:41.000]   shall I lift up my head." Or with another, "The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:54.720]   to do. My Saviour's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from me." Philip, preach Christ,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:04.040]   preach Jesus Christ, the good news God bringing in his kingdom, rescuing us from the world and
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:13.880]   the flesh and the devil and hell, by punishing his own dearly beloved Son for our sins, and
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:22.600]   offering us free pardon and forgiveness, clothed with his righteousness divine, and makes us his
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   own children. Because we are children, we are heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:40.280]   The people listening in some area, they believed, and the result was, there was great joy in that
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:49.040]   city. Is there joy in your heart? Is there joy in your heart tonight? In this world as it is,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.520]   there was great joy in that city because they believed this message. Have you got that joy?
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:06.760]   Do you know that your sins are forgiven? Have you lost the fear of the terror of law and of God,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:19.240]   and of death and the grave and the judgment and of hell? Has it gone? Are you rejoicing in Christ
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:27.040]   Jesus? That is what it means to believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
