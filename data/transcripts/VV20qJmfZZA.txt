[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.640]   So I've got my list here.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.280]   And Jesse, I guess I'll get your take on these books.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.760]   So as long-time listeners know, my goal is typically to read five books per month.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.720]   This is possible, I find, if you just on a semi-regular basis
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520]   put aside non-trivial amount of time to reading,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.800]   and then as you get close to the end of a book, just get after it and say,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   "I'm just going to go and finish this book."
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.320]   So with a little bit of intention, it's often surprising how much you can read.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.520]   So I thought I would go through what I read this month,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.480]   and we will get the official reaction of producer extraordinaire Jesse
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.920]   on each of these books and my weird reading habits.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.280]   All right, so book number one I finished was a biography of Steven Spielberg
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.960]   called "Spielberg, A Life."
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.880]   This has been part of my kick of reading movie books.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.360]   So as listeners remember, from October, I read a bunch of books about movies.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.240]   This picked that up.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.960]   Quick technical note about how I do my reading list.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.240]   There's multiple ways you can do this.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.840]   The way I do it is I count the book in the month that it finishes.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.360]   You could do it the other way and count the book in the month that you start.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.280]   It's the same thing as long as you're consistent about it.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.960]   So Spielberg, I actually started on this book way earlier in October,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.880]   but it finished earlier in November.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.400]   Pretty good book.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.080]   So here's my question for you, Jesse.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.720]   Here's a quiz.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.560]   How much money would you guess?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.240]   We talked about this already, "Jurassic Park."
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.280]   How much money would you guess Steven Spielberg personally made from "Jurassic Park"?
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.880]   We have not talked about this.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   Let me guess.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.880]   I remember when I saw that movie.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.120]   Three million?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.440]   Two to four hundred million dollars.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.960]   Oh, all time?
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.880]   He made it himself, personally, two to four hundred million dollars.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.200]   There's a little bit of debate about what comes in there, but he had,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   at that point, his deal was 40%.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.720]   40% of gross, basically, and it was a billion dollar movie.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.040]   Two hundred million dollars for one movie.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.960]   It's good negotiating on his part.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   The other thing I learned is that it is a pain, no matter how many people you can hire,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.080]   no matter how much money you have, it is a pain to have many properties.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.520]   That's another little tidbit I picked up.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.640]   So Spielberg had a lot of houses and a lot of apartments, and his ex-wife hated it.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.280]   She felt like it fell on her.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.080]   And I don't know, this is like a rich person parable about context switching.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.960]   There's just overhead, right?
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.280]   I mean, even just the overhead of, I got to hire the right person to run this property.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   So it's a ton of overhead.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   Maybe that's why Elon sold all his houses.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.520]   That's true.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   So there we go.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.600]   This is our very approachable advice for our listeners this week.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360]   Be wary on the number of high-priced luxury properties you maintain because of the overhead
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.200]   involved.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.760]   This is good.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   We've been really approachable here.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.040]   Maybe just like two ocean properties.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.200]   I don't want to be controversial, Jesse, but maybe just limit yourself to two oceanfront
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.760]   properties.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.880]   More money, more problems.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.360]   Exactly.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.640]   All right.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600]   So book number two.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.800]   So this was every year for Halloween.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.040]   In the lead up to Halloween, my tradition is I always read some sort of book that is
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.720]   vaguely Halloween-y, so like a thriller that has to be sort of supernatural or Stephen King,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.440]   something like this.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.240]   Longtime tradition.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.840]   So I didn't finish my Halloween book till the second day of November.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.000]   So it counts under November.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   But I went back and reread Relic.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   Have you heard of this one?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.240]   No.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.120]   Fantastic.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.760]   It's fantastic.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.840]   This is Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.480]   Preston also writes for The New Yorker.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.920]   And it is a book that came out right after Jurassic Park.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.640]   So this was the big comparison.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.440]   The poll quote on the cover of the paperback version of this book is "better than Jurassic
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.000]   Park."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.360]   That's the poll quote they put on it.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.400]   But Preston, if I have this right, he has a background in archaeology or paleontology,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.040]   something like this.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.360]   He occasionally writes New Yorker pieces on dinosaur bones, so something like this.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   He used to work or had some connection with the National History Museum in New York, which
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.800]   is like this massive old building that's multiple city blocks long with all these sub-basements.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.840]   And so the idea of this book, which is just fantastic, is that there is essentially a
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.040]   monster loose in the Museum of Natural History.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600]   And it's like emerging and killing people in a brutal way.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   And they don't know what it is.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.160]   And in the end, it's not supernatural.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   No spoilers.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.840]   But there's actually a scientific explanation for what's going on.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.000]   It has to do with this expedition that's cursed.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.440]   And there's this monster.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.600]   And it's this great buildup.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.120]   So it's a great setting.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   The Natural History Museum is just a great setting.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.280]   And there's this buildup of the monster getting more and more bold until there's a giant gala
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.680]   event.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.880]   And it just all goes crazy.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.240]   And people are having their heads eaten.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.400]   And it's fantastic.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.920]   So I'm pro-Relic.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.800]   They made a movie on it.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   I didn't like the movie as much.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.240]   It was a great book.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.080]   Was the book better than Jurassic Park?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.400]   No.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   So I reread Jurassic Park recently, too, because my son wanted to read it.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   I thought, I don't know.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.040]   Is this appropriate?
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.600]   He's nine.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.040]   So I reread it.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.400]   And it's like, OK, I think this is appropriate.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Jurassic Park is cooler, right?
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.240]   I mean, I think Spielberg has these big ideas.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.080]   And it's like interesting plot.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   And the plotting is really interesting.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.000]   And the tech and the intersection is very interesting.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.520]   Relic is a better crafted thriller.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.320]   It's a beautifully crafted thriller.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.440]   It moves in just the right pace.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   But Jurassic Park is just cool.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   It's like dinosaurs.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.640]   And there's this-- for some reason, a chaos mathematician is there.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.000]   And people are trying to understand what's going on with the dinosaurs'
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   breeding and the fences are down and Muldoon has a rocket launcher.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   I mean, I think it's a cooler book.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.840]   Though I did-- because I was bored-- was talking to my discrete mathematics class at Georgetown
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.760]   last week.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.040]   And we were talking about chaos theory, right?
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.360]   Because we were talking about recurrences.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   And they were asking about-- let's not get technical.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   But are there closed form solutions to all recurrences?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.720]   And I was talking about when you get the second or third order, you get these nonlinear
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.120]   recurrences that are hard to predict.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.000]   And that's chaos theory.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.240]   And this is what Malcolm's character is in Jurassic Park, is a chaos theoretician.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.480]   Book recommendation, by the way.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.880]   Side note, Chaos by James Gleick.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.960]   It's a science book about the rise of chaos theory.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   Fantastic.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.640]   So anyways, my argument to the class was there is no world in which it makes sense
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.360]   if you are the insurance company insuring Isla Nublar, where they're building Jurassic Park.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.720]   There is no world in which it makes sense where you say, what we need
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.920]   is a chaos mathematician to come out here and take a look.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.240]   Have you thought about that?
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.040]   It makes no sense.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.840]   It's just a guy who--
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.400]   Vaguely speaking, yeah, chaos theory-- look, here's what chaos theory is about.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.560]   There's these certain recurrent equations.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   So it's an equation where you put in the value from the prior time step into calculating the
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.000]   value for the current time step.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.040]   And if they're nonlinear, so you raise things to powers bigger than 1,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.160]   they can become really unpredictable, right?
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.440]   So it's really if you change the input a little bit and then run it 1,000 times,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   your number ends up in a really weird place.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.360]   And chaos theoreticians study these and find that there's these deep, beautiful structures
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.760]   like Lorenz attractors if you look at the derivatives or the second derivative.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.200]   And it's really interesting math.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.920]   It has nothing to do with keeping large animals properly contained within electrical fences.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.960]   It has nothing to do with it.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.760]   I never even noticed that the chaos theory character was in there.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.680]   I was just kind of more concerned with the dinosaurs.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   Yeah, it's Jeff Goldblum.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   You know?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.080]   Oh, I guess, yeah, you're right, yeah.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.120]   He's a cool character.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   He's a cool character.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.360]   But all he does-- all he does is say, "I study mathematical equations that are unpredictable."
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.960]   Ergo, it might be unpredictable to have dinosaurs that you bred,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   and they might get loose because it's hard to predict.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   You don't got to fly him there.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.520]   What's he looking at?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.280]   What's he looking at?
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.080]   That's an email.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.280]   I think it's a problem.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.960]   But I'm sure-- we should go do this work-- but I'm sure that Michael Crichton came across
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.600]   chaos theory, maybe even read the James Gleick book-- I think that's from the 1980s--
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.360]   and just said, "This is cool.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.200]   I got to put this in the book somehow."
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.120]   And he just wanted to find a place for the character.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   So anyways, it's a bit of a problem.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.200]   Other thing I noticed is I reread Adronomous Strand.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.000]   I mentioned that on the show.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.320]   The science there is a lot tighter.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.600]   Because I think Crichton had more time.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   It was his first book under his own name.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.040]   And the science gets pretty loose.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.840]   It gets pretty loose in Jurassic Park.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.240]   But all right, so that's book two, Relic.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.800]   Book three is a digital ethics book.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.760]   It's not-- it's academic, but not super academic.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.960]   It was called Future Ethics.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.800]   Sort of a survey.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   And it was OK.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.440]   It was interesting.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   Someone's surveying a lot of different ethics.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.480]   The thing it did, a lot of which is fine,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.760]   it's just not my particular jam, is a lot of just,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.600]   you know, let me as the author just think through hypothetical scenarios.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.120]   And to me, that's not too interesting.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   But it was an impressive survey of a lot of existing theory.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.120]   And it took the book I had read the month before, Moralizing Technology,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.160]   which was more academic and had this really cool framework called Mediation Theory,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.680]   which I talked about on the podcast, which I think
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.600]   Peter Paul Van Beek, who wrote this book, is on this.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200]   Something that is a fantastic normative theory framework for digital ethics.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.080]   It should get more attention.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.880]   The book I read next, Future Ethics, gave a really good summary of that,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.720]   which actually helped me understand it better.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.440]   So for that alone, I think I enjoyed Future Ethics.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.560]   - Did you incorporate in that in your New Yorker article?
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.960]   - Which one are we talking about?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.760]   Which New Yorker article?
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.240]   - The ethics one where you're talking about the digital
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.040]   and then you interviewed those different, you know, people.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.680]   - Yeah, no, I haven't gone that far.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.760]   Not really.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.800]   I mean, I sort of obliquely mentioned some of these philosophical frameworks.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.120]   - Because in that article, you gave, I think, five different examples of people
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.880]   you talked to about their view on.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.040]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.680]   So this was the, I don't know if we talked about it on the podcast,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.920]   but I wrote an article about Instagram, basically.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.680]   Well, kids and social media.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.240]   And the title was something like the question we're not asking
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.720]   about teenagers and social media, because, I mean, again,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.240]   I've talked about this on the show before,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.760]   but it always strikes me to the degree that the coverage
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.720]   of anti-social media coverage, the sort of standard media response
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.800]   to social media from both sides of the political spectrum,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.400]   completely sidesteps the issue almost always of
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   what should our personal relationship be to these tools?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And so there was this leak, there's this whistleblower,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.520]   and she leaked some internal data from Facebook
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.080]   where they were interviewing teenage girls who were saying,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.720]   "This technology makes me unhappy, makes me anxious,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.400]   increases suicidal ideation, makes me feel bad about myself."
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.640]   And it was something like a third of the people they interviewed
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.760]   were reporting this, right?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.320]   And so that's bad.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   None of the coverage said, "Okay, so maybe teenagers shouldn't use it."
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.440]   All the coverage right now is so fixed on just,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.160]   "Facebook is our political enemy.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.200]   We need to control them and punish them and get them to do what we want to do,"
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   which is all fine, but also we need to have the other conversation of,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   "And should we maybe not use these?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.280]   Or maybe teenagers should not use these?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.800]   Or maybe we should rethink our relationship to these tools?"
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.600]   So yeah, I wrote a piece where I was investigating that question,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.800]   and I interviewed four experts.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.880]   None of those experts are really philosophers, I guess, is the issue.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.680]   They're more practical.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.080]   This is more in the weeds, this philosophy.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.760]   But I want to try to bring some of this out of the weeds
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.960]   with some of my future writing.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.720]   I think there's some really smart thinking going on
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   about understanding technology from an ethical perspective.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.720]   And I'm pretty convinced this mediation theory that Peter Paul Verbeek has pushed
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.640]   describes digital minimalism.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.360]   That digital minimalism, the philosophy in that book,
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   is actually a real-world instantiation of that philosophy, accidentally.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.680]   So I didn't know about that philosophy, but I think it is.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.880]   So I'm thinking about writing an academic piece where
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.360]   talk about this practical theoretical dyads,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.920]   where how do you take these philosophical frameworks,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.200]   which are kind of complicated.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   I mean, mediation theory uses late-stage Foucault,
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.080]   and it's not super general public-friendly.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.560]   But digital minimalism takes the core ideas
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.480]   and makes it very general public-friendly.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   Maybe we should be doing more of that and be thinking,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   how does that actually work as an academic process?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.160]   So I'm thinking about that.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   All right, so then I did another hard turn.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.200]   So after Future Ethics, I finished a book I had started over the summer called K,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.920]   the letter K.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.440]   It was subtitled as something like
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:18.160]   The History of Baseball in Five Pitches, maybe 10 pitches.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.200]   But it's one chapter per pitch, fastball, curveball.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.480]   And it's a history of that pitch in the sport
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   and kind of the influence it had on the sport.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.600]   - That's cool.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.920]   Can you identify all the pitches when you're watching on TV with their phone?
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.720]   - No. - Neither can I.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.640]   - No, I'm always impressed by the announcers.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   - A lot of them played for so long, I think that's part of it.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   Well, it's definitely part of it.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.960]   - Well, I learned from this book, it's pretty subtle, right?
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.000]   Because, I mean, curveballs are easy, fastball is easy,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.240]   but the off-speed stuff is all, you know, is it cut?
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.440]   Is it a slider? Is it a change-up?
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.800]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.480]   I got pretty good at Max Scherzer and Steven Strasberg's pitches
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.160]   because they had, you know, Strasberg's change-up was very demonstrable.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.480]   It would just, the floor would open.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.120]   It would just go offstage through a trap door,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   seemingly six inches in front of the bat.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.000]   And Scherzer had a slider that just would, like,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.720]   someone had a rope and just would pull this thing
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.520]   as it was coming towards the hitter.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   And Strasberg's curveball would, like,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.720]   basically be 20 feet above the player's head
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.320]   and then come back down again for a strike.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.040]   So I could kind of register those,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.400]   though we're not allowed to mention Max Scherzer's name on this podcast anymore.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.840]   I was just going to ask you about that.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.120]   We're not allowed to mention his name.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.880]   I think your next guest should be Steven Cohen
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.480]   and ask him how, you know, what his thought process were in signing him.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.240]   Look, man, for $43 million a year,
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   I'm not going to complain that Scherzer went to the Mets.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   And I found out, so I have more sympathy.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.720]   So for non-baseball people, the Mets are in our division.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.560]   We play them all the time.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.240]   But Scherzer's oldest kid, I think, is staying in school here in D.C.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.600]   So it's one of the reasons he wanted to stay in the Northeast Corridor.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.080]   So now he can see his kids more.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.760]   And he's getting $43 million a year.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.040]   So I'm not mad at Scherzer.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.320]   And I'm not mad at the Nationals.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.920]   They should not be paying $43 million a year this year for Scherzer.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.320]   But still, still, I mean, I still had a hard time this year
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.920]   seeing Bryce Harper play for the Phillies.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.240]   So it's going to take me some time.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:32.960]   All right.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.200]   All right.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.080]   But that's in, this is literally insider baseball.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.760]   All right.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.480]   So final book was, I have it here actually,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.600]   it's called Number by Tobias Danzig.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   This is a book written in the 1930s.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.880]   And it has a cover quote from Albert Einstein.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.240]   So like, as blurbs go, I think that's pretty impressive.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.600]   Here's what, it's a cool book, but here's why I'm embarrassed.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.200]   I'm going to explain to you why I'm embarrassed.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.240]   So I got this book, I got it from, I got it for free from a free library.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.160]   A 1954 edition of this book that first came out in 1930.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.360]   Albert Einstein quote, it's a book about a cultural history of numbers.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.160]   So it's a cool book.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.240]   It gets a little mathy towards the end, but it's a cool book.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.520]   But I get this book and I'm thinking, this is cool.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.160]   This is from the fifties, you know, and the version I have,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   and it's from a different time and it's really interesting.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.600]   And I'm thinking, you know, I should, I should collect like old editions of books.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.400]   Like this would be a good hobby for me is get early editions of books or first
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.760]   editions of books. It seems like it, like it makes a lot of sense.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.240]   And then this is what happened.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.400]   So the viewer at home doesn't see this.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.760]   I ripped the cover off.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   So maybe I should not be trusted.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.640]   Maybe I should not be trusted to collect rare books.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.160]   This beautiful 1950 copy.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.680]   I ripped the cover off by accident.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.280]   So I don't know, maybe I should stick with things that are less, less damaging, but good book.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.800]   All right.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.520]   So that's my report.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.480]   What do you think, Jesse?
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.200]   So when you go into the, when you bear down and get the
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.960]   reading done, when you're getting to the end of a book, what does that look like?
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.040]   Um, I mean, are you reading for like five hours nonstop?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:22.560]   Like no, I'll do, yeah, I'll do like hour sessions or like 90 minute sessions and I'll put aside
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.400]   time, you know, like specifically to do it.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.520]   Like I'll take an hour out of my day to just like go and read.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.320]   Like I start getting hungry for the time or I'll decide that what the family needs tonight is
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.920]   reading time, which my kids love, like we're all going to read.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:43.120]   So yeah, it's just like, I started doing a lot more of it, but I just, I'm just about to finish
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.600]   my first December book and I'm honing in on the second.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.040]   So I have a good, I have good head of steam.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.120]   This is the recording this on the 3rd of December.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.400]   So I'm getting my first book done in the first few days.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.760]   And so it feels good.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.720]   One other question.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.680]   Do you count sometimes audio books with these?
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.280]   Spielberg was an audio book.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.760]   Okay.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.000]   So every month, the five that you have one's an audio book or usually.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.440]   So during the little league season, I was making a lot more progress because there's a lot of just
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.960]   sitting at fields while my son was doing practice or baseball.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   And then I could really get a lot of audio book time.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.760]   So now it's a little harder because it's not little league season anymore, but I'm almost
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.120]   done with a George Lucas biography that I started right after the Spielberg biography.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.160]   And that's audio.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.400]   It's like, I'll probably finish that up in my ears at some point during this month.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.600]   So just for the audience, can you give like your thought process on the audio
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.280]   versus reading same thing or.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.920]   Yeah, it's for me, it has to be a very specific type of book.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.040]   If it's a business slash biography, like if it's about business for whatever reason,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:51.120]   or like a business type biography, like a director or a CEO and it's their life or Disney.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.920]   I did a lot of the Disney stuff and I went down that rabbit hole was audio.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.400]   That is very good for me to listen to.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.600]   I can't do novels.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.040]   I can't do more serious nonfiction.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.000]   There's like a very small number of things I can actually do in audio.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.960]   So I usually stick it for like bio businessy type stuff.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.000]   All right, so there you have it.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.480]   All that is the, that's the November reading list.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.640]   Hopefully everyone else has their own target, whatever it is they're going for.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:24.800]   And let's wrap this up and move on to some questions.
