[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:29.980]   Throughout the draft, I think it's very easy for him to be as confident as he is knowing his ability to walk into certain interviews and certain people and not hit it off immediately with GMs or coaches or whatever it may be. They definitely took a slight to that and it caused him to slide. Now he gets in a situation where they need a quarterback. They're looking for one. He has full open competition to be able to go get a one or two job. He looks confident.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.720]   He's playing well. He'll continue to get better. And I think in due time, everybody will see what he is, who he is and what he's meant to be.
