[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   We apologise for the distortion during the first few moments of this recording.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This was due to a fault on the original master tape.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The words to which I'd like to call your attention this evening are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   in the first chapter, and reading verses 14, 20, 21 and 22.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   By him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We are still continuing, in other words, this great statement of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   which is made by the great apostle in this section of scripture,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   starting at verse 12 and going on, at any rate, to the end of that 22nd verse.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Now, I'm putting it like this, that the ultimate test as to whether we are Christians or not is simply this,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   that we give praise unto the Father.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   That's the fundamental statement in verse 12,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light."
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now, that's what a Christian is.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   A Christian is one who realizes that he has been made fit and meet
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And he realizes that he's in that position, solely and entirely,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   because of what God the Father has done for him.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And we've been considering what was necessary to be done
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   before any of us could ever be brought into that position.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   We have seen that there are great difficulties on our side,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   for we are all by nature, as we are told here,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   under the dominion and the serfdom and the slavery of the power of darkness,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   who hath delivered us from the power of darkness.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You remember, we considered that, and saw ourselves as the slaves of Satan,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   quite incapable of setting ourselves at liberty.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We need to be set at liberty from that.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   But not only that, there is something terribly wrong within us,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   enemies and alienated in our minds by wicked works.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Something's got to be done about that before we can ever be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and enjoy God, and enjoy heaven.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   As we are by nature, heaven would be hell to every one of us.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You take the typical modern man who's spending his night in drinking, gambling,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and who's spent his morning in reading the newspapers.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Put him in heaven, in the presence of God and holiness,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   where they do nothing but praise God.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He'd go mad. It would be hell to him.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Obviously, he's got to be changed. He's got to be changed in his mind.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He needs a new nature. That is necessary.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We need to be made holy.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We need to be made holy, unblameable, and unreprovable.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Because nothing can dwell in the presence of God unless it is holy,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   unless it is blameless, unless it is unreprovable.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So all that's got to be done to us.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And what the apostle says is that it has been done to those who are Christians.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And that it's God who's done it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But then you see, last Sunday night we were considering the other side of the difficulty.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   There it is from our side, but look at it from God's side.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Because God is God.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   How can he have any dealings at all with us?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   How can he even look upon us?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Such as we are by nature as we've seen.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Well, in other words, as we were able to show last Sunday night,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   the problem of reconciling men, the problem of being kind to us and good and blessing us,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   and having us as his people,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I say with reverence posed for the almighty and everlasting God,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   the greatest problem of all.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   The problem of creation was nothing when you put it by the side of this.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   God simply had to speak, and it was done.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Let there be light, and there was light.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   He took the dust to the ground and he formed men,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and he breathed into them the breath of life.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I say that that was comparatively trivial.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   When you put it by the side of this problem of reconciling fallen men,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   who is the slave of the devil,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and twisted and perverted and alienated in his mind and heart by wicked works against God.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Well, we saw something last Sunday night of how it was that God overcame that problem.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Well, now, then, there is what the apostle tells us.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And it is because we realize that he's done all this,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that those who are Christian give thanks and praise unto him.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Who else could do it?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Who else could deal with the problem in us?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Still more, who else could deal with the problem in the being and the person and the character of God?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But it is God who's done it, giving thanks unto the Father,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Very well.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Now, all along, as we've been dealing with every one of those problems,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   we've had to say that God has done it in and through his Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's there everywhere.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   In whom? The Son.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "We have redemption through his blood," the Son.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   "Even the forgiveness of sins," and on it went.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   "Having made peace through the blood of his cross," that's the Son again.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "By him," the Son, "to reconcile all things unto himself," and so on.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Very well, we've had to say that, that always we see that God has done it in and through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He hasn't done it by just sending a word from heaven.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   He hasn't said it by just raising up servants on earth and giving them a message.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   No, he's done it in and through his only Son.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The description is here. I'm not calling attention to it tonight, but it is here.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   This Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "By him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible," etc.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's always in and through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   But now that brings us to what is in many ways the heart of the whole of this matter.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   The point at which we see most clearly why any man who is a Christian must of necessity give thanks unto the Father with the whole of his being.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But the question confronting us now is this.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   How has God done this for us?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   In and through his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now, that is precisely the question that is answered in these verses that I'm inviting you to look at with me this evening.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Here is the answer, I say.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   This is how God has done it, in and through his only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   What is it? Well, let me read these words to you again.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "In whom we have redemption."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Now, some of you have got newer translations.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   This is the old authorized version, and this says, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Some of you with your more modern translations, revised version and others, find that the term "through his blood" is not there.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Now, this is a matter of dispute.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It doesn't make any difference to the teaching, because he says it again elsewhere quite clearly.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's simply a question of the manuscripts.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And in some of the oldest manuscripts, the expression "through his blood" does not happen to be there.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But you see, though it may not be there, here it is in verse 20, "and having made peace through the blood of his cross."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Same thing.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   So that if it was an interpolation, in verse 14, we're not a bit surprised.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Here it is stated explicitly in verse 20, "having made peace through the blood of his cross."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And again in verse 22, "in the body of his flesh through death."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Very well.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   There are our statements.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   What does this mean?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   What does this mean?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   This table with a cloth over it, and underneath that cloth there is broken bread and there's poured out wine.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The communion service to which I've invited you to remain.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   What's it all mean?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Why do we do this?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Why do we do this twice every month?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Why do some people do it every Sunday?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Why do some do it three or four times a year?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   What's it all about?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   What's it mean?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Why do we do this in particular?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   That's the matter that is before us.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Now let me put it to you, let me put the apostle's statement to you, in the form of some three propositions,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   which will help us, I think, to remember it and perhaps to understand it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The first is that it is God the Father who was acting in Christ for our salvation.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Now I'm very concerned to emphasize this.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You see, our fundamental text is giving thanks unto the Father who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And did you notice in all these statements the emphasis is put there?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell, and he the Father having made peace through the blood of his cross, the Son.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   But it's the Father who's made the peace through the cross of his Son, by him, by the Son, to reconcile all things unto himself, the Father.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   By him, I say, by the Son, whether it be things in earth or things in heaven.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, that's the Father, remember?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   It isn't the Son, it is the Father who's done it, in the body of his flesh, that's the Son.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight, the sight of the Father.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Now then, why do I make a point of this?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Well, I make a point of it because it's the thing that the Bible states everywhere.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Let's take your favorite verse of all Scripture, John 3, 16.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   What's it tell us?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   What it tells us is this, that God so loved the world, God the Father, that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   God so loved the world, the Father.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Or take another glorious statement which we are always thinking of and having in our minds at this Advent season and this Christmas time.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Galatians 4, 4, "When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   God sent forth his Son.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Oh, and I could quote you many other passages.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Listen to it in that statement in 2 Corinthians 5.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   "God hath committed to us," says Paul, "the ministry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in and through and by Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   For he, God, hath made him the Son, to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Why am I emphasizing this?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Well, I'm doing so, of course, because there are so many people, Christian people in particular at this point, who very rarely speak of the Father at all.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And who give the impression that salvation is something that is done entirely by the Son.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Some of them even go so far as to say that the Son of the Lord, Jesus Christ, even has to persuade his Father to forgive us.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   That he has to plead with the Father to forgive us.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He pleads the merit of his blood and he says, "Look at me, look at my wounds, listen to me and my pleading."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   As if the Father were opposed to it all and antagonistic.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And the Son has to persuade him and intercede with him as it were to change his mind in order to forgive us and to receive us.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And there are many who only pray to the Lord Jesus Christ and never to the Father.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's why I'm emphasizing what I'm emphasizing.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   That's a terrible error and heresy.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It's a terrible thing to say that the Father has to be persuaded by the Son to forgive us.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   There isn't an iota of evidence in the scripture for that.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's in some of the hymns, but they're not divinely inspired, good as they are.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's the hymns who say that kind of thing.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And it's wrong, it is false, it is untrue.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   If that were true, you wouldn't give thanks to the Father, you'd give thanks to the Son.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But the apostle says, "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be the partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Very well, let's get this clear before we proceed.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   The way of salvation is God's, the Father's.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It is his plan, it is his purpose, it is his idea, it is his thought.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This, of course, is the marvelous and the wonderful thing.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   As the old teachers used to put it,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   that the three members of the blessed Holy Trinity had that great counsel and conference in eternity.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Over what? Over the redemption, over the salvation of men and women like ourselves.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And there the Father put this great plan.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And the Son, as it were, stepped forward and said, "Here I am, send me, I'll go and do it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   A body hast thou prepared me."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He gave himself to be the executive, as it were.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   "Send me," and the Father said, "I'll send you."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It is the plan of the Almighty Eternal Father who sends the Son to do the work that is essential
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   before we can be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And the Son having done it, the Holy Spirit comes, opens our eyes to it, and applies it to us.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And thus we are eventually going to be holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Very well then, I say, let's be clear about this.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   This is the plan of the Father.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It is the Almighty Father who sends the Almighty Son.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And it is the Almighty Father and the Almighty Son who send the Almighty Holy Spirit.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   We praise the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but primarily in this matter of redemption,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   we praise the Father who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Let us never forget this, that the Lord Jesus Christ came into this world and did all he did
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   not to bring us to himself, but to bring us to the Father.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Listen to the Apostle Peter saying that in 1 Peter 3, 18,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, that just for the unjust, that he might bring us unto God."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   That's why he did it. Don't forget that.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   You mustn't stop at the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   He brings you to the Father.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   It is through him we have access by one Spirit unto the Father, says the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 2.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It is the teaching of the Scripture everywhere.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Let's not forget it, my dear friends.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Let's not be wrong at this point.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Let's not imagine that the Son, I say, has to persuade the Father.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It is the Father who sent the Son.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   God so loved the world that he gave.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   When the fullness of the time was come, God sent his own Son.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It's God who is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   not imputing their trespasses unto the Father.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Very well. We leave that as our first proposition.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   It is God the Father who is acting in Christ for our redemption, for our salvation.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And that brings me to the second principle, which is this one.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The crucial point of this action of God in Christ was on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Now here's the thing that's emphasized.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   This is something that comes out everywhere. Did you notice these terms?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Having made peace through the blood of his cross, blood,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   in the body of his flesh, body, flesh, blood, cross.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   These are the terms that are emphasized in this great statement of the gospel.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And these are the things that should fill us with a sense of wonder and of amazement
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and make us give thanks to the Father tonight.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   What's it mean? Well, body, flesh, who's that? That's Jesus Christ.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   He's a man, but he's the eternal Son of God also.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   But in order that you and I might be made a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   he who is spirit eternally took unto him a body.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   He who was in the form of God and counted it not robbery to be equal with God
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   was made in the likeness of men.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   The word was made flesh, body, flesh. He was born a babe in Bethlehem.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   You know, there's something wrong with us, my friends, that we can listen to things like this
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and even my saying them without being filled with a praise to God
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   that would take us right out of ourselves.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Have we ever understood what God has done about us and about our salvation?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Body, flesh, blood.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   You see, we haven't got a philosophy here. This isn't just a teaching.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   This isn't a morality. It isn't an ethic. It isn't just an idealism.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   No, no, this is sure fact.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   God has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   by doing certain things, and this is the big event,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   the coming of the Son of God into this world in a body, in flesh.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Flesh and blood, bones, a man, bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Here it is, this astounding and staggering thing.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Ah, yes, but we don't stay with the incarnation tonight
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   because we are considering what's represented by the bread and the wine, the death.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Having made peace through the blood of his cross,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   in the body of his flesh through death, that's how he's done it, that's how he's reconciled us.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Now I do want you to notice this.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Let's ask a question tonight.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   There's only one Sunday between us and Christmas. Let's ask a question.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Why did the Son of God ever come into the world?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   What was the purpose and the object of the incarnation?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's the way to celebrate Christmas, to ask that question.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Why did the Son of God ever come?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Why did the Father ever send his Son into this world?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Why did he do it? Well, the answer that's given today, of course, is
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   he came in order to teach us.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   What the world needs is teaching.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And he is the greatest teacher of all, the greatest religious teacher,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   the greatest ethical, moral teacher, the greatest thinker, the greatest philosopher.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He's supreme. He came in order to give us this teaching, the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   If only that were put into practice, there'd never be another war.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   The world would be perfect and all would be well, we'd have no troubles at all.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It's the teaching of Jesus we need. All we need is to apply this teaching of Jesus.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   He came in order to teach us. That's what men say. That's what they say Christianity is.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And others put the emphasis not so much on his teaching as on his example.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   They say there's great power in an example.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   They say that an ounce of example or illustration is worth a ton of theory.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   They say it's all very well to put the teaching, but when you see it incorporated in a body,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   when you see it exemplified in a person, well then you say,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "I see what it is and I'm going to follow him. I'm going to imitate him and I can do him."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And that's the current notion as to what Christianity is, that we're imitators of Christ.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   We say, "He lived like that in this world. Let us rise up and live like him. Let's follow him."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   That's Christianity. I'm going to set out to imitate Christ.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   He came to give me an example and the encouragement of such an example.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And yet you see the extraordinary thing is when we come here to this great summary of the Christian gospel,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   we don't find either the teaching or the example mentioned at all.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I've been reminding you Sunday by Sunday that this is a perfect synopsis of the Christian gospel.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I've told you why the apostle gives it to these Colossians.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   He does it in order that they may not be misled by the false teachers and believe a false gospel.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   He says this is the true gospel.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You remember how he said that at the very beginning,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   "Which is come unto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit as it does since he heard it,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   and knew the grace of God in truth."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   That's the emphasis that he puts upon it.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,"
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   the word of the true gospel, over against the false gospels.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Now here then is a summary of the true gospel.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And the interesting thing is this, there's not a word about our Lord's teaching.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   There is not a word about his example.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   The apostle having described the glory of the person goes on to say this,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   "And having made peace through the blood of his cross,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   by him to reconcile all things unto himself,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and you that were sometime alienated by wicked works,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   were they reconciled in, by, through the body of his flesh through death."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Not a word about the life, not a word about the example, not a word about the teaching.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   He comes straight from the incarnation to the death upon the cross.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Now my dear friends, this is the heart of the Christian gospel, this.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And this is where there is all this confusion at the present time.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   God saves us in Christ by the death of Christ, not by his life and teaching.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Why? Well, there's very good reason for that.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   The teaching and the example of the Lord Jesus Christ were never intended to save us.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Why not? Well, because they couldn't.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   "What do you mean?" says somebody.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "Do you mean to say that the teaching and the example of Christ can't save us?"
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I say they not only can't save us, they damn us more than anything else that's ever come.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   "What do you mean?" says somebody. "Oh, I'll tell you what I mean."
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   God gave the children of Israel the Ten Commandments.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And when he gave them the Ten Commandments, he said to them,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "If you can keep these, they'll save you."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And not a single person kept them, not one.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   By the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in thy sight.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Not one. Nobody ever kept it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Well, my simple argument is this.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   The life of Christ, the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   is infinitely higher than the Ten Commandments.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   There you get it in its most spiritual form,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and you see it exemplified in his perfect life.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   What's the use of giving a yet higher teaching to people who can't keep the Ten Commandments?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   What's the point of giving an absolutely perfect example
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   to people who've already failed to keep a lower test and a lower standard?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You see, the thing is nonsense.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And yet, you see, this is regarded as Christianity tonight.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   That Christianity means the preaching of the teaching of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   That we should appeal to the nations to practice the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and to turn the other cheek, abolish armaments, and then you'll get perfect peace.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Oh, what a lot of that's going to be said the next fortnight.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   But it's a complete travesty of the Gospel.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's a denial of the Gospel.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It's a complete negation of the Gospel.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It's impossible.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Well, then you say, "Why did he teach?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Why did he live the life he did?"
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I'll tell you, it's not at all difficult.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   The whole point of our Lord's teaching was to show us that it was impossible.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   His teaching was just to show us that we couldn't do it.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   But you say, "That's monstrous." Is it?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   You go back and read your Gospels.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   You keep your eye on the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and the doctors of the law.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Why were they so annoyed with our Lord's teaching?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   He showed them plainly that they couldn't do it, and they hated him for it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You see, because all proud Pharisees felt they could do it.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   They said, "Ah, we know the law. We are the experts on the law.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And we are keeping the law and living the law, and therefore we are well pleasing in God's sight."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   "Wait a minute," said Christ, "let's examine you for a moment."
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You say, "I've never committed murder."
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   All right, but have you said to your brother in your heart, "Thou fool, if you have, you've already murdered him."
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   You say, "I've never committed adultery."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   "Wait a minute," says our Lord, "you don't understand the law."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   "Have you looked at a woman to lust?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   If you have, you're guilty of adultery."
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   He convicted every one of them.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   They thought they'd kept it.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   He proved to them they hadn't kept it.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   That's the purpose of Christ's teaching.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It is to condemn us all.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   It is to show us that we're all helpless, all hopeless, and none of us can do anything whatsoever.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   That's the whole point of his teaching.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Let's say this for the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   They at Enneret understood what he was saying, but the modern Pharisees don't.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   They talk about imitating Christ.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   They talk about putting his teaching into practice, as they are.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   They don't believe in his death and in a new birth.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   They say they can rise up and do it as they are.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   They're even duller than the Pharisees.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   That's the whole trouble with them.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   No, no, he didn't come simply for the teaching.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   There's no mention of the teaching here.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   There's no mention of his example and of his life, because I say they couldn't save us.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   They are simply to show us how hopeless and lost and damned and condemned we are.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   But what is emphasized, you see, is this.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Is his death, body, flesh, blood, cross, calvary, straight from the birth to the death?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Well, now, this I want to show you is something that's taught universally in the New Testament.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   There's no excuse for any mistake about this.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Look at John the Baptist.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Here's the immediate forerunner of Christ.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Here's the herald who goes before him announcing that he's coming.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   What does he say about him?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   This is what he says.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   That's it already.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Before he's even appeared in his public ministry, John announces him as the Lamb that is to be slain.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   The Lamb of God to be slain to take away the sin of the world.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Did you notice it in that 16th chapter of Matthew, out of which we read a portion at the beginning?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And did you notice where it came?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It was immediately after Caesarea Philippi and Peter's marvelous confession,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "Thou art the Christ, the Son of God."
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But did you notice how immediately after that, our Lord began to tell them that he was going to be arrested
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   and going to be treated badly by men, that he was going to be put to death?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And Peter, who just made his marvelous confession, "This shall be unto thee, Lord, forbid from thee, Lord."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   The same Peter.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Peter didn't want him to die. Peter didn't understand that.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "Get thee behind me, Satan," says our Lord, "for thou savest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   "You are thinking in human terms," he says.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "You think I'm just a great man and you're proud to be with me, and you like my teaching and you're going to follow me.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   You're going to be one of my disciples. And when I say I'm going to die, you don't like it. You're stumbling."
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Of course, because you don't understand that's why.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You don't understand God's way.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   You think I'm just a new religious teacher.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You just think I'm one who's got a teaching which is a bit better than anybody that's gone before,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   and that I'm giving a wonderful example, and that this is the way of salvation.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   It isn't. When I tell you I'm going to die, you're annoyed.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Why? Well, because you don't know that that's the only way to be saved.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   "Get thee behind me, thou savest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Then you remember we are told that on the Mount of Transfiguration,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   "There appeared unto him Moses and Elias," and what were they doing?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   They were talking with him about the exodus that he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They were talking to him about his death.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Do you remember his great statement which is recorded in Matthew 20, 28 and Mark 10, 45?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life for ransom for many."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   He says, "You know, what I'm doing is altogether different.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   In this world, the great man is the man who is served by somebody else,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   but in the kingdom of God, greatness means serving.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I'm not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, indeed to give my life a ransom for many."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Has it ever struck you to notice the amount of space which is given to the details of our Lord's death in the Gospels?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Has it ever struck you?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   The corresponding large amount of space which is given to the death.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   You can almost hear the nails being hammered in.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Why all the details about the death?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Why? Because it's the crucial thing, the vital thing.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It's everywhere, I say, in the New Testament.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   In Acts 20, 28, I read that the church is something that has been purchased by the blood of Christ.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   The Apostle Paul reminds the Corinthians, he says, "Listen,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   We preach, he says, Christ crucified.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   He says, "I know that it's a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I know that it's foolishness to the Greeks."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Nevertheless, I preach him.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   We preach Jesus Christ crucified.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Why? Well, because he's the power of God and the wisdom of God,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and he keeps on saying it, the crucifixion.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   He summarizes his gospel again to those Corinthians in chapter 15.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I would remind you, he says, of the things that I preached to you at the beginning.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   What were they?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   How that Christ died according to the Scriptures,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   and that he was buried and that he rose again according to the Scriptures.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   This is the theme of his preaching always everywhere.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   In writing to the Galatians, he reminds them at once that Christ gave himself for us,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   that he might deliver us from this present evil world.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   In Ephesians, he says, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins."
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   There you get it again in Ephesians 2.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Precisely this same message comes out everywhere.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   He says, "There was a time when you were without Christ,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and strangers from the covenants of promise,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   are made nigh," how? "by the blood of Christ."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And listen to him saying in Ephesians 5, he's talking about the church,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   with the washing of water by the word."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Here it is. I could keep you almost endlessly.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "He gave himself for us," says Paul in writing to Titus,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   "that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   He gave himself for us on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   But the most remarkable statement in many ways of this whole matter is this.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   It's in the epistle to the Hebrews, the second chapter and the ninth verse.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I ask my question again, why did the Son of God ever come into the world?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Why did God send his Son out of heaven into this evil, sinful world?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Why did he send him here? Do you know the answer?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   He did it in order that his Son might die.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Why was he born as a babe? Why did he have a body?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Why did he have flesh and blood and bones?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Why? There's only one answer. In order that he might die.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   for the suffering of death.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   That's why he was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It was for the suffering of death.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   "Crowned now with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   For every man, taste death.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   He was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He was born, he was sent as a man, he was given a body.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Why? In order that he might die.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   He came to die. He was born to die.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Not to teach, not to give an example, but to die.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's the meaning of the incarnation.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   You go straight from incarnation to death.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Why? Well, because it's the way whereby we are saved.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   How are we redeemed? Ask Peter the question.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   He says, "For as much as ye know that ye were redeemed from your vain conversation
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   inherited from your fathers, not with gold or silver or such things,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   but by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   The book of Revelation is the last book in the Bible.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Do you remember that extraordinary statement right at the beginning?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Listen to it. Here it is in verse 5.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Now, they never established my point.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   It's God who saves us in Christ, and the crucial point at which he saves us
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   is in the death on Calvary's hill, by his body, his flesh, his death, his blood.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   But now I come to my third principle and ask the most vital question of all.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   What then was God doing in and through his Son on that cross and on that death on Calvary's hill?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   You see the logic, don't you? It's the Father that does it in the Son.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   The crucial point at which he does it is on the cross.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Well, what was the Father doing in and through and to the Son upon the cross?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   What's the meaning of the death of Christ on Calvary's hill?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Well, I suppose that of everything about him that is misunderstood,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   this is the one that is misunderstood most of all.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   What's the meaning of Christ dying on the cross?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Well, the popular view today, many of you heard it no doubt recently on the television
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   in an interview, was that this is just the supreme example of pacifism.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   That there he's just saying this, "Do what you like to me, I won't hit back.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I'm not going to defend myself.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Do anything you like, it's all right, I'm not going to defend myself.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I've done away with all such thoughts as armaments and any self-defense.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I'm leaving myself, I abandon myself, I stand for truth.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   You don't agree with me very well, I simply stand, I'm not going to fight,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I'm not going to defend, that's all I'm doing."
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   What's the message of Christianity?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   The message of Christianity is this, that when all the nations and their leaders
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   believe that message and do away with all their armaments,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   there will be no more fighting or war and the kingdom of God will have come.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   That is what is taught by men in high positions in the Christian church.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   This is just sheer pacifism, nothing else.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   He just abandons arms and self-defense.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   If only the world would listen to him and put it into practice,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   have a great disarmament conference, the kingdom of God will have come.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   That is solemnly taught as being the meaning of his death upon the cross.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   There are others who tell us that it's this,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   that there he is dying on the cross and as he dies he looks at us and says,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "Though you do this to me, I still love you.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Though you've misunderstood me and though you've even done this to me,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   it's all right, I still go on loving you."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   You'd be surprised to know the number of people who are regarded as great evangelicals who say that.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   That's the position we've arrived at.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   We don't know our own case, our own position, our own truth.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   They say there, and when you see him saying that, he'll break your heart
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and you'll say, "Oh, I must believe in you," and so you're saved.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Others put it like this, that it's the Father who's saying that.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   That the Father says, "Though you're doing this to my only begotten beloved son,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I'll still forgive you."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   He'd already said that he was a God of love and that he does love us all,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   but we can't see it, we don't believe it.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Well, he says, "Look here, though you've done that to my only son,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   I still forgive you. Can't you see my love now and give in to me?"
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   They say it's just that.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And there are others who would have us believe that our Lord dying on the cross
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   was just offering some great act of repentance and of penitence on our behalf,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   that we haven't understood the nature of sin he has,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and there he's making a final confession of the utter sinfulness of human nature
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and mankind with whom he's aligned himself.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Oh, I mustn't keep you with these false theories.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Why are they wrong, every one of them? Well, for this reason.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   That every one of them regards what happens on the cross as a tragedy.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   They don't talk about the wondrous cross, they talk about the shameful cross.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Secondly, they think it was entirely the action of men.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   They put their emphasis entirely on that cruel man didn't understand him,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   and they crucified him in their jealousy and their rivalry and so on.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   The action of men, and they all in turn leave it unto us.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   I must understand his teaching, and I must down my arms, I must cease to defend myself,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I must let people hit me, knock me about, do anything they like, tramp instead, doesn't matter.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   As long as I do that, I'm imitating Christ, and so I'm saved.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   That's what they teach us, that we must imitate him, abandon ourselves completely,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and so, by imitating him at the supreme point, we please God,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   we are forgiven, and we become the children of God.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   That's why they're wrong, because they say that, because you see, the true teaching says this.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   What's happening on that cross on Calvary?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Well, whatever else is happening, I must start with this.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   It was God who was doing something there, not men.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Listen again.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   The whole emphasis, I reminded you at the beginning, was what God the Father has done.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, it's the Father,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   in whom we have redemption through his blood, then here it is,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and God having made peace through the blood of his cross, it's God acting.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamed?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   It's always the Father acting, so that anything that tells me that it's man's action is already wrong.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Not only that.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   This wonderful teaching tells me that not only was it God doing something there,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   but that God has done something there once and for all,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   and that it was by doing what he did there that God redeems me,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and makes me meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the saints in life.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   It's God who's done it all.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Not man, not something I've got to do.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   It's what God has done to me and for me in Christ.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   By it, you notice, is the term all along.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And having made peace through or by the blood of his cross,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   by him to reconcile in the body of his...
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Yet now, hath he reconciled in or by the body of his flesh through death?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   It's always put like that.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   It's the Father that does it through this medium, by this means.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   What does it mean?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Well, let me summarize it for you as I close.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   You know, the mistake people make is to read the New Testament only,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and they don't know their Old Testaments.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   The Old Testament is a book of prophecy pointing forward to the New,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   telling us what is going to happen.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   If only they knew that, what would they find?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Well, they'd find this.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   There in that Old Testament, God gave a message to his servant Moses,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   told him to build a tabernacle, later a temple.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And instructed him that certain animals were to be taken,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and that the high priest was to put his hands on the head of the animal,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   as a sign that the sins of the nation were being transferred to this animal.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And then that animal was to be killed, and his blood was to be collected,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   and the blood was to be taken into the presence of God in the holiest of all.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   It's there in great detail.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   What's it mean?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   "Ah, this is a prophecy," I say.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And then you get the explicit statements in the actual prophecies,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   such as that 53rd chapter of Isaiah that I read to you just now.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   There you get the key and the clue to the understanding
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   of the meaning of the cross on Calvary's hill,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   but we've got it in a word here, redemption, in whom we have redemption.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   What is the meaning of the word redemption?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Well, it's this.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   It means to set at liberty by the payment of a price.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   It was something that was very common in the ancient world.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   People who were captives could be bought,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   could be set at liberty if somebody paid a given price.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   It was a ransom price.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   A ransom price was paid and the captive was set free.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   That's the very term that the apostle uses.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It's the term that's used everywhere.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Redemption.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   We need to be set free.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   We've already seen from what?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   We need to be set free from the law of God that condemns us.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And what is its condemnation?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   It is death.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   "The soul that sinneth, it must die."
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It shall die.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And here it is.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   We are under the condemnation.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   The law has got us in prison and the sentence is death.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   And it must be carried out because it is God's holy and unchangeable law.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   How can I be redeemed?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   What's the price?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   The price is death.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And the answer is that God there was exacting and taking the price of my redemption.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   How?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Well, through the death and the bloodshedding of his only begotten son.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Now there's a great word used by the apostle Paul in Romans 3.25.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   "Whom God, he says, has set forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood."
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   That's it.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   What's it mean?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   It means this, my dear friend.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   That holy, eternal, just and righteous God, he can't play with sin, as I explained last Sunday night.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   What he says he must do, and sin must be punished, and the wages of sin is death.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   "And the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   There it is.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   And there's only one price that's enough.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   It is death.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   But who is there that can pay it?
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Where is the man that is innocent and pure and sinless that can pay the price
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and therefore not die himself eternally?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   There isn't one.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   All that sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Any man has to die for his own sins, and therefore he can't redeem another.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Is there no Redeemer?
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   There isn't, not one.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And that is why God sent forth his own Son, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   He came to redeem us.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Because he is God as well as men, he can be put to death but not eternally.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   He rises in the power of his Godhead.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   He can finish dying and go on living because he's God as well as men.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   That is why he is the Redeemer, and that is why he is the propitiation through faith in his blood.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Now, I mustn't keep you, my dear friends, but I do want you to go home and read Isaiah 53 for yourselves.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Did you notice these tremendous phrases?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   He was wounded for our transgression.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   He was wounded for our iniquities, bruised for our iniquities.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   It is God, remember, who is acting right through.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   It pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   He hath put him to grief.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Here it is everywhere.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And the Apostle Paul puts it in his own words in 2 Corinthians 5, 21.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   What's it mean?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Well, it means this, that God has taken your sins and mine and the guilt attached to them, and has put them on his own dear sinless son.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And God smote him in order that you and I might be forgiven.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   That's what it means.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   He made peace by the blood, through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto him.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   It was the only way.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Sin must be punished.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Sin has been punished.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   God took my sins and put them on his son, and he smote him instead of smiting me.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   That's why he came into the world.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   He had to be a man, yet of a body that he might be smitten.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   A word from heaven can't do it.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   A man must die for a man, and the man must come, the man Christ Jesus, also son of God.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Listen to it again.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   My dear friends, the New Testament is full of this.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   This is what they all preached.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Listen to Paul again.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   reconciled, he says, by the blood of his Son.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Listen to this.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all to the death on the cross,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   how shall he not also freely with him give us all things?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   That is why Christ came into the world.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   That is why God the Father sent him into the world.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   It was for the suffering of death.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   It was that he might taste death for us.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   It was that he might pay the ransom price.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   It was that he might redeem us.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   God was acting on Calvary.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   It wasn't men.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   It wasn't even the Son.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   The Son was passive.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   He was the Lamb of God.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   He wasn't acting.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   It was the Father doing things to him.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   He said, "Here I am. Put them on me."
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   He was passive.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   It was his passive obedience.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   The activity was entirely the activity of God the Father,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   who laid our sins upon him, and smote him, and bruised him, and struck him,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   and made his soul an offering for sin,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Very well, I end by putting it like this to you.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Giving praise unto the Father,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Why should I give praise to the Father?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Why should I give thanks to the Father?
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Why does every Christian give thanks to the Father?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   In order to make me fit, and meet, and qualified to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   he sent his only begotten dearly beloved Son into this evil sinful world
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   to endure the contradiction of sinners, and the mockery, and the shame, and the spite of it all.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Oh, he didn't stop at that.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   He sent him to the cross on Calvary.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   He put my sins upon him.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   He smote him.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   He so dealt with him that that son turned to his father and said,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   The father, seeing my sins on him, turned his face away from him,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and he smote him, he struck him, he bruised him.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   The father did that to his only begotten dearly beloved son
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   in order that he might forgive me,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   in order that he might reconcile me unto himself,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   in order that he might deliver me from the power of darkness,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   in order that he might change my nature,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   and put this new nature of Christ his Son into me
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   so that I am no longer an enemy and an alien in my mind by wicked works,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   but I am a new man in Christ Jesus.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I have the mind of Christ,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   and I desire God, and I desire to know him,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   and I desire to please him.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   I want to be holy. I want to be ready and fit for heaven.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I am God's man, and no longer my own or a child of Adam.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   That's why.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   That's why a Christian praises and gives thanks to the Father,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   for he sees that God so loved the world
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   that he gave even to that awful death
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   his only begotten Son,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   but have everlasting life.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   God sent his Son into the world to die
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   in order that whosoever believes in him should not perish.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's the only way.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   His teaching can't do it. His example can't do it.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Nothing can do it. He must die.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   He must bear this punishment.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   He has done so.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   His own Father punished him
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   that he might reconcile us who believe in him unto himself,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   and finally and eventually to present us to himself
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   holy, blameless, and unreprovable,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   sharing with others the inheritance
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   of the saints in light.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Have you given thanks to the Father?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Do you give thanks to the Father?
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Have you seen the meaning of this bread and wine,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   the meaning of the cross?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Do you say quite honestly,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   "Love so amazing, so divine,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   demands my soul, my life, my all"?
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   If you see this,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   you'll thank him for the remainder of your life
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   and throughout eternity in the glory.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Have you seen it?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   There it is, the ultimate message of Christmas.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Amen.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Our closing hymn is hymn number 63, the 63rd hymn.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   it fills the heart with ecstasy.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Hymn number 63.

[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   and the love of God,
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   the fellowship of the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   abide and continue with us now this night.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   and until we shall be in that glory,
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   sharing the inheritance of the saints in light,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   seeing the Lamb of God that once was slain,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   beholding God,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   and enjoying the glory everlasting.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Amen.
