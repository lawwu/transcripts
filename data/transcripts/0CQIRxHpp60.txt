[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   (applause)
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.940]   All right, I'm gonna do my best to channel
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.440]   some Jack Bogle here.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.840]   We're gonna talk about staying the course.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.580]   I miss Jack.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.340]   I tried to go to my first--
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.080]   or went to my first Bogle Heads meeting,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840]   I think it was 2008.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.380]   So I wanted to meet Jack.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.520]   And those who were there know he was in the hospital.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.120]   He was in the hospital with some heart problems
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.820]   and he wasn't able to make it,
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820]   but he called in from the hospital by video.
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.020]   So he did speak to us at that conference.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.500]   But I had to come back to a later conference
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.100]   to actually meet Jack.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.600]   And I wish you all were able to sit here
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.100]   and have Jack teach you this principle.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.500]   So I'm gonna try to do the best I can in his place.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000]   Let's start with his words, though.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.340]   In fact, we're mostly going to use his words
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.380]   for this section, because "stay the course"
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.780]   seems so easy that you all just wanna tune out
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780]   and not even think about it.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.420]   Of course, the last principle is "stay the course."
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420]   But you know what? It's the hardest one to do.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.860]   All the other ones are easy compared to this.
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.360]   So this is what Jack said.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   He said, "Stay the course.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.260]   "No matter what happens, stick to your program.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.100]   "I've said 'stay the course' 1,000 times,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.940]   "and I meant it every time.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.240]   "It is the most important single piece
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.380]   "of investment wisdom I can give to you."
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.040]   And he has said it so many times
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.820]   that he says it in a whole bunch of different ways.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.920]   He says, "Press on regardless."
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.720]   He says, "Don't do something, just stand there."
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.060]   So what does "stay the course" really mean?
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.700]   Well, I think there's about five things that it means.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.860]   So let's talk about them, each individually.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.400]   Here's the first one.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.040]   "Don't change your plan based on how you feel."
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.180]   Now, these quotes you see here,
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.040]   these are all from Jack Bogle.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.040]   He said, "Investors should keep their emotions
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.540]   "the heck out of the way."
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.100]   "Investor emotions plus fund industry
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.400]   "promotions equals trouble."
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.300]   "The greatest enemies of the investor
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.820]   "are expenses and emotions."
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.520]   "And time is your friend, impulse is your enemy."
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.780]   We all feel like the market's gonna go down
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.560]   or the market's gonna go up.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120]   I would challenge you to actually keep track
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.560]   of those feelings and those predictions you have.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920]   Get yourself a little $2 journal
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.700]   that you buy at the grocery store
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.140]   and start writing down these predictions of yours.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.280]   It is a very enlightening exercise to do this
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.040]   over the course of a year or two or three.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   And you will be surprised by the end
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280]   how poor you are at predicting the future
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.260]   and how wrong your feelings are quite often.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.220]   One of my favorite books,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.720]   I can't even remember the name of it,
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.060]   which is really sad,
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.960]   is an attorney who lived through the Great Depression.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.860]   And he put an entry in this diary
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.140]   every two or three months throughout the 1930s
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.000]   talking about the economics of the era.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.180]   And it's fascinating to read in real time
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180]   the history that you now know,
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620]   but what it was like to live through it.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.540]   And that can be what your journal is,
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.720]   is it can help you to live through your feelings
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.420]   about the markets and your investments.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.680]   But I can promise you this,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.020]   if you actually keep track of them,
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.680]   you're not gonna pay any attention to them after a while
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.720]   because they are wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.860]   All right, the second thing stay in the course means
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.600]   is don't chase performance.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.300]   Jack said buying funds based purely
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.540]   on their past performance is one of the stupidest things
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.400]   that an investor can do.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.000]   And there's a reason they have to put that
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.500]   in every mutual fund prospectus.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   It's because it's true, it's true.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.840]   Chasing performance is a terrible way to invest.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.820]   You buy it right after it does great,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.480]   right before it does poorly.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.820]   So when you're staying in the course,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.680]   you're not chasing performance.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.320]   It means don't keep looking for a better plan, okay?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.300]   Jack said the greatest enemy of a good plan
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.620]   is the dream of a perfect plan.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.060]   Stick to the good plan.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.460]   My wife and I, we drew up an investment plan in 2004.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.740]   I think we made a couple of changes in 2005 or 2006.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.300]   We made one other change in like 2016.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.380]   And we followed that investment plan
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.140]   from being dead broke to being financially independent.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.120]   Is it a perfect plan?
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.720]   No, it's a pretty good plan.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.080]   It's not the best plan.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.580]   If I'd had a crystal ball in 2005,
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.380]   the plan would look very different.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.280]   But I did not have a crystal ball.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.860]   We picked a good enough plan and we followed it
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.100]   and it worked amazingly.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.660]   You funded a reasonable plan adequately
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.300]   and you will reach your financial goals.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.560]   Okay, stay the course means to be patient.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.540]   Jack said, rely on the ordinary virtues
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.540]   that intelligent, balanced human beings
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.040]   have relied on for centuries.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.280]   Common sense, thrift, realistic expectations,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820]   patience, and perseverance.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.820]   It's not that easy to stay with the same plan
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.420]   for 15 years, much less 60, right?
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.160]   Your investment career is probably about 60 years long.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.660]   30 years accumulating, 30 years distributing,
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.460]   give or take-ish.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.300]   That's a long time to be patient with the plan,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.540]   but that's what it requires to be successful.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.800]   Okay, stay in the course means
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.680]   you don't sell out at market lows, right?
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.380]   Jack said, if you have trouble imagining a 20% loss
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.380]   in the stock market, you shouldn't be in stocks
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.620]   because they do that all the time.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620]   If you sell low just once late in your accumulation phase,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.660]   that can be a financial catastrophe
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.120]   that keeps you from ever reaching your financial goals.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.400]   It is so important that you do not sell out at market lows.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.560]   It might be the most important thing about investing.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.600]   Imagine an investor who sells out of their stocks
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.580]   at each of the following time periods
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.080]   and then buys back after the recovery to the prior high.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.120]   Hey, if you did that in March of 2003, right?
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   Stocks have been going down for three years, right?
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.920]   All these tech stocks have gone to zero.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.720]   It's never gonna come back.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.580]   They're flying planes into our buildings in New York City.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.320]   Right, you remember this if you lived through it, right?
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.120]   If you sold out at that moment
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.260]   and didn't buy in until the market recovered,
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.300]   you had a 46% permanent loss of capital.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.700]   All the money you had invested in stocks,
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.100]   46% of it is just subtracted from your nest egg
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.640]   and never comes back.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.340]   March, 2009, the global financial crisis.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.680]   Money market funds are breaking the buck, right?
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.940]   Everybody's panicking.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.120]   On the Bogleheads forum,
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.280]   everyone's talking about plan B.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.980]   Everybody remember plan B?
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.220]   You know, as a physician, plan B
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.280]   means something very different,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.420]   but on the Bogleheads forum,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.860]   plan B was the idea that you bailed out
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.460]   if it got bad enough.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.660]   And I didn't really like plan B, I wasn't a big fan,
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.160]   but I can tell you it was discussed extensively
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   in 2008 and 2009 on the forum.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   If you had sold out your plan B in March of 2009,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.280]   62% permanent loss of capital, okay?
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.340]   Who remembers 2011?
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.020]   Nobody remembers 2011.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.640]   It technically wasn't a bear market.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.380]   It was only like 19% or 19 and a half percent down.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.760]   It wasn't 20% down.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.960]   If you sold out there though,
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.660]   19% permanent loss of capital.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.360]   December, 2018 is the other one everyone forgets about.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.460]   It was down 18, 19% again that month.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.660]   If you sold out, 18% permanent loss of capital.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.060]   We all remember the start of the pandemic, right?
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.300]   'Cause they shut down the NBA
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.840]   and we had nothing else to do but look at our stocks.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.740]   34% permanent loss of capital,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.980]   just because you weren't patient enough
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.780]   to hold on for a few more months.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.940]   Right now we're down what?
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.220]   I don't know, 20%, 25%, something like that.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.480]   We don't know how bad it's gonna get,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   but if this is the bottom this month and you sell out,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.020]   it's 25% permanent loss of capital.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.700]   These are real situations that you gotta live through.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.100]   You should ask yourself,
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.200]   what do I have to expect as an investor
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   who's gonna be investing for 30 years as an accumulator
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.940]   and for 30 years as a decumulator, okay?
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.440]   Well, corrections, AKA a 10% drop,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.040]   occur on average every 19 months.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.520]   If you go back and look at all the data we have so far.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.380]   Bear markets, which is a 20% plus drop,
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.820]   occur on average every 3.6 years.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.180]   So with some simple division,
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.920]   I don't do algebra like Mike,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.160]   with some simple division,
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.020]   I can tell that I'm gonna have to go through
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.720]   a bunch of these.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.000]   Well, I'm gonna have to go through
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.860]   about 39 corrections as an investor.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.940]   I'm gonna have to go through
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.560]   about 17 bear markets as an investor.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.540]   This is an expected event, right?
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's an expected event to go through a bear market.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.420]   It shouldn't be a surprise when it happens.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.140]   You know it's gonna happen
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.820]   every two or three or four or five years.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.220]   Your plan should address it.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   You should plan to stay the course with your plan
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.820]   throughout these events that you plan for.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.160]   On average, bear markets last 10 months, okay?
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.400]   Sometimes they're much shorter, right?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.300]   That one with the pandemic, whoop, it was back, right?
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.140]   It was the fastest bear market recession
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.740]   I think we've seen in a long time.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   Although that one was in October of 1987,
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.480]   that one was pretty quick too, right?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.420]   Huge one-day drop, biggest one-day drop ever.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.640]   Still finished positive for the year in 1987, right?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.780]   If you'd bailed out, permanent loss of capital.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.820]   It's interesting, if you look at the markets,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.920]   the history of the markets,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.800]   and you should be a student of the markets,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   stocks have provided a positive return in 78% of years.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.360]   That includes many of those years
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.960]   when there was a correction
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.240]   and when there was a bear market.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.840]   I think it was Alan's slide earlier
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.340]   that he showed of all those maximum drawdowns
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.400]   that you had during a year with a positive return.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.480]   Happens all the time.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.880]   Okay, so here we are, Jack Vogel's advice.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.420]   Stay the course.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.680]   It is the most important single piece of investment wisdom
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.180]   that I can give to you.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
