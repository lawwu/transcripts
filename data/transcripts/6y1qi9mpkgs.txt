[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.240]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, our show where we answer questions from you. We get
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760]   questions all the time from podcast listeners and YouTube viewers and people who read our
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   blogs and our email is askcompoundshow@gmail.com. Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Liftoff,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.280]   which is our automated investing platform through Betterment. Duncan, are we going to
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.880]   do a video? Yeah, do you want to do the full one or the shorter one? You pick. Okay, we'll
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:57.880]   do the full one. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Liftoff. Liftoff 30 minutes after the
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.040]   end. It's just beautiful. You know, I've been getting, I have a Liftoff account. I opened
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.760]   one for my wife and I opened one for each of my kids and I've been getting a lot of
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.920]   emails this year from Liftoff about tax loss harvesting opportunities. See, so there's
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.600]   a positive spin there. If you want to learn more about Liftoff, we actually have an advisor
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800]   who works there. We have a few advisors who can help. So, if you want an automated investing
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.200]   platform with an advisor who you can ask questions to, go to liftoffsinvest.com.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.080]   Alright, John, throw up my first chart of the day here. This is just the S&P. This is
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.520]   a little stale now that the stocks have gone down more. I posted this about a week ago.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.000]   This is just this year for the S&P 500. You can see we've had a ton of down, up, down,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   up, down, up, and all these different changes and a lot of volatility. I posted this and
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   Andrew on Twitter responded with this following question. John, throw it up there. "Ben,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.240]   any precedent for this? Or is this typical pain in a bear market? It's my first, can
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360]   you tell?" So, this guy Andrew is living through his first bear market. And yes, there's plenty
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.280]   of precedent for this. Bear markets are painful. They're volatile. They test your discipline
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.160]   and your intestinal fortitude as a long-term investor. But here's the thing. If you're
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   a young investor and this is your very first bear market, today's situation for you is
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.640]   far better than things were nine, twelve, eighteen months ago. The S&P 500 is now down
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.600]   a little more than 20%. Russell 2000, small cap stocks, is down almost 30%. The Nasdaq
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.840]   100 is down more than 30%. Prices are on sale. And not only are prices lower, but you can
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.640]   find some yield on your cash for once. For years, the most asked question we got on Animal
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.200]   Spirits and some of our other platforms where we had email were, "What am I supposed to
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.640]   do with my cash savings? I'm earning zero yield. I want to save for a wedding. I want
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.000]   to save for a house. I want to just have my emergency fund, but I'm earning nothing in
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.400]   cash. There's no yield." Guess what? You can find some yield in your cash. One-and-two-year
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.120]   treasuries are yielding 4%. That means higher interest rates on your savings account, your
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800]   CDs, short-term bond funds. Duncan, when I used to get my hair cut in high school, I
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.600]   went to a proper barber shop. Old school, four chairs, and lots of good conversation.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.520]   But it was slow. And every time I went in, I'd have a scheduled time. My old barber Roger
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   would say, "Hey, Ben, sorry. Service is down, but the quality's up." Every time, without
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.840]   fail. And I'd have to wait 20-30 minutes until he was done talking to someone. Great conversation.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   And then I'd sit in the corner and read a Sports Illustrated. This was before cell phones.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.000]   I think it's similar today in the financial markets, especially for young people. Prices
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.040]   are down, but expected returns are up. Service is down, but the quality's up. If you're a
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.600]   young person in your 20s or 30s, you can expect to live through, I don't know, seven to eight
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   brutal bear markets. Maybe two to three extreme, bone-crushing crashes. Maybe more, maybe less.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.000]   But bear markets are great for people making regular contributions, because it means valuations
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.240]   are down, dividend yields are up. And this time, bond yields are up. Usually in a bear
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.800]   market, bond yields are down, because bonds typically go up when stocks go down. This
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.160]   time it's not happening that way. Listen, every bear market is unique in its own way.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   This one is different that way, because maybe rising rates are causing the stock bear market.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.960]   But the emotions you feel during every bear market are the same, because human nature
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.720]   is the one constant. So, how do you survive these bear markets? I think especially for
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.840]   young people, it's just you have to automate. You put your contributions on autopilot, you
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   rebalance periodically to make it automatic, and then each year you increase the amount
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.680]   you save. And for God's sake, don't worry about days and months in the market when you're
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   in your 20s. Worry about decades, because that's your time horizon.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.280]   Yeah, fair. That makes sense. Good advice. I recently got my hair cut, and I went to
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.560]   two places, and they were both completely full. The third one had no one in it, and
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.920]   it was a bad, bad idea. The barber was like a crazy person, but they cut my hair.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.960]   So there's no line for a reason. Okay, that's fair. My wife finally made me, after the last
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.120]   couple of years, stop getting my hair cut at Great Clips for $9.99.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   Yeah, I mean, that's a good deal. It's a good deal.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.920]   All right, got to save some. I'll probably double that now. All right, let's do a question
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   from a viewer.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.600]   Okay, so up first we have a question from Wes.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.240]   In previous shows, I've heard you and Michael Batnick mention that you lease your vehicles.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.640]   Would you be able to elaborate on when you think leasing a vehicle is most appropriate?
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   Conventional financial wisdom says that cars are always viewed as liabilities, and this
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.720]   same wisdom almost frowns upon leasing a car. For context, I'm a recent college graduate
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.840]   with a great job who's moved from California to Colorado, where I'm contemplating buying
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.440]   a more expensive car that is suitable for the snow. I regularly contribute to my retirement
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.320]   accounts, but I do already have a car payment, student loans, and rent. I want to make sure
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.240]   I'm making a smart financial move if I choose to upgrade my car.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.240]   All right, so one of the first things you need to learn as a young person, budgeting-wise,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   is fixed expenses matter way more than variable expenses. It's not your lattes and your eating
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.760]   out that matters. It's your fixed expenses. So that means, for most people, the biggest
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.720]   ones are going to be housing and transportation.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.760]   So, John, throw up this tweet from this week from CarDealershipGuy. "New record this week.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.120]   Percentage of consumers who finance a new car with a monthly payment over $1,000. So
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.240]   in June 2019, it was a little under 5%. Now it's fast approaching 13%. $1,000 for their
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.400]   monthly payment, which is just insane to me." And I get how it happens, because car prices
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.560]   are way up. People buy these huge SUVs and trucks.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.320]   That's a hefty payment, yeah.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.360]   That's huge. And that's a fixed payment. And that doesn't include things like insurance
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.560]   and gas and all these other ancillary costs that come with owning a car. And the price
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.760]   of a car, I know they've gone up in recent years, but most of the time, that's a depreciating
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.520]   asset. So, as a personal finance guy, I never thought I would've leased my automobile. But
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.080]   I did my first lease in 2015, because it was a great deal, thinking I could simply buy
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.120]   it when the contract ran up, back when there actually were good deals on cars.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.680]   And so, I personally leased my Ford Explorer and have been leasing ever since then. And
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.080]   here's some of the reasons why I personally leased. And I think this is circumstantial.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.540]   So my office is like four miles from my house, so I don't put a ton of mileage on the car.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.520]   I have three kids, aged eight and under, and kids destroy the interior of a car. Peanuts
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:51.860]   and Cheerios and Goldfish everywhere. I would rather have the dealership take on that destruction.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.620]   The payment is lower. Sure, I'll never go without a car payment, but it's a reasonable
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.060]   level, so I don't really mind it. I've had a lot of bad experiences with used cars over
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.140]   my lifetime. I've replaced transmissions, alternators, brake pads, brakes, tires, you
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.000]   name it, I've probably replaced it. Call me crazy, but I enjoy driving a new vehicle once
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.580]   every 36 months or so. The technology gets better. I don't think you can really beat
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.700]   the new car smell. That's kind of hard to beat. I don't know if that's worth it.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.020]   That's worth the payment alone, right? That new car smell.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.740]   But listen, leasing a car is certainly not for everyone. Those are my reasons. But if
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.100]   you want to run the numbers, there's this guy who emailed us in a while ago and said,
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.060]   "Hey, guy's name is Jesse Kramer. He has a blog called The Best Interest, and he wrote
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.020]   a fantastic blog post called The True Cost of Car Ownership." So he actually ran the
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.140]   numbers to figure out, if you want to figure out buy versus lease, here's the things that
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.380]   you should run the numbers on. Again, because a lot of it's circumstantial.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.100]   First of all, it's how long you plan to drive the car and how far you drive it. He said
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.760]   depreciation is by far the biggest expense. So you can assume the car drops by 10% immediately
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.020]   driving it off the lot, and then an additional 10% each year for the next five years. Now,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.340]   most new cars are covered for 36 months under warranty and maintenance, and after that you're
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.100]   on your own. So the cost of repairing an older car is estimated to be twice the amount for
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.780]   a new car. That's part of the reason that I lease. You also have to factor in the cost
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.780]   of fuel registration insurance. He says the average cost of owning a car is something
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:19.480]   in the range of $0.35 to $0.65 per mile over the life of the vehicle. So per mile driven.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.740]   So assuming a car can last 15 years and go 200,000 miles, that would bring the cost of
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.260]   a $30,000 car to like $90,000 over the life of it, if you add everything up. Repairs,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.820]   gas, insurance, maintenance, all this stuff. So he says that the premium for leasing is
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.260]   about 5% per mile. But you take the catastrophic thing off the table, where if you wreck the
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.540]   car and something goes really wrong, they'll take care of it. So I think the biggest things
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.620]   you have to figure out is how long do you want to drive the car for? How many miles
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   a year do you drive it for? So if you're putting on 15,000, 20,000 miles a year, leasing doesn't
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.380]   make sense. If you want to trade up every few years, some people do, some people don't,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.580]   it doesn't make sense to buy if you're going to trade up. And do you care if you have a
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.260]   car payment? Because the great thing about buying is once it's paid off, if you pay off
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.940]   in cash or just pay it off after three, four, five years of your term of your loan, then
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.620]   you don't have a car payment as long as you drive it. So I say no right or wrong answers
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.060]   here. I don't think that there is like a black and white. A lot of, like most things, it's
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.700]   pretty circumstantial. Depends on how much you want to drive it.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.180]   Also, I was just going to mention, Jesse's often in the chat here on our very videos.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.540]   I don't see him today. But so good Twitter follow. So go check out Jesse's stuff.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.180]   Yeah. Sharp guy. All right. And Duncan, you should do a poll. Own versus lease in the
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.500]   thing here. I don't know how to do the polls. You do it.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.980]   Yeah. I already did one, actually.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.980]   Oh, you did one? Okay.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.860]   Let me see if I can find what the result was. All right. I'll look for that. I'll look for
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.860]   that while you're talking next.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.860]   All right. Let's do another one.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.420]   All right. So up next, we have a question from Brandon. By the way, they just did an
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.300]   announcement that they're about to start vote testing. So we'll see.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.540]   All right. Duncan's dealing with a fire alarm drill today. So if we hear anything in the
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.660]   background, that's why. It's always something.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.100]   Yeah. Okay. So up next, we have a question from Brandon. I'm 24, single and have no kids.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.380]   I'm currently hellbent on trying to buy a house with cash early in my life. I have $63,000
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:13.460]   in my 401(k), $21,000 in my IRA, $5,000 in crypto, and $67,000 in a brokerage account.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.940]   I also have $130,000 in cash on the sidelines. There's cash on the sidelines. Everyone's
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.500]   always talking about. My only debt is $15,000 of student debt, and payments aren't due until
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.380]   January, and the interest rate's 4.4%. Due to my income being high and living in a fairly
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.980]   inexpensive area, buying a house with cash is very realistic in four to six months. I'm
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.180]   currently paying $950 a month in rent, and my expenses are relatively low. That being
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.420]   said, I'm conflicted. Should I stay on this path, or should I put a lot more into the
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.540]   market? My 401(k) and IRA are maxed out for the year, but at current prices, it's a solid
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.380]   buying opportunity in my brokerage account with the cash I'm sitting on. At the same
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.400]   time, the psychological satisfaction of being mortgage-free would be great, and a saved
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.820]   income in the future may fuel my retirement faster. How would you handle this?
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   Lewis: Alright, this is our not-to-brag of the week, for sure. 24 years old, doing really
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.420]   well.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.740]   Lewis: Also, imagine how much that crypto was back a year and a half ago.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.860]   Lewis: True. Yeah, it used to be $20,000, now it's $5,000. We get a lot of housing-related
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.620]   questions here at The Compound. Paying for a house in cash is obviously rare, but it's
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.860]   certainly a question we've gotten before. The interesting thing to me here is, my advice
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.260]   now versus 9-12 months ago is totally different, because mortgage rates. So, John, throw up
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.500]   the mortgage rates. This is Mortgage News Daily, publishes these daily. So, you can
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.860]   see, as of yesterday, 30-year fixed is approaching 6.5%. You can see, but they showed the 52-week
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.180]   range there is a low of 3. So, I think a year ago, you could have gotten a 30-year mortgage
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:42.860]   for like 2.9%, 3%. Man, it's just brutal when you think of that. So, I think if Brandon
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.820]   would have asked this question of mortgage rates at 3%, I would have said, "He's nuts.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.740]   Why would you pay cash when you have a 3% mortgage that is going to be eaten away by
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.140]   inflation and that's such a low hurdle rate?" Plus, you have interest deduction you can
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.460]   take off. So, now, with mortgage rates at 7%, that's a much higher hurdle rate. I think
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.220]   it actually makes more sense. So, I guess the biggest worry here would be, am I going
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.340]   to miss out on some compounding in the stock market? Now, obviously, with the mortgage,
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.940]   you know exactly what that return is going to be. No one knows what it's going to be
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.120]   in the stock market. Houses are illiquid, but if you paid it in cash, you could always
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.600]   take a mortgage out or a home equity line of credit in the future if you need to, maybe
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.580]   if rates come back down, that makes sense. And I guess the other question is, how comfortable
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.300]   are you locking up that much cash in your home? That takes your diversification down
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:32.660]   significantly. One of the things we talk about here a lot is regret minimization. So, maybe
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:38.180]   Brandon has thought about, I don't know, pay 50% in cash for the house and invest the other
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.260]   50% and split the difference somehow. There are some benefits to paying with cash. It
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.380]   puts you in a much better bargaining position. I talked a few months ago, Duncan, how I sold
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.720]   an investment property earlier this summer. The person who bought it from us bought in
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.820]   cash. And boy, not to pat myself on the back here, but I'm pretty sure I top ticked the
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.940]   market when I sold that. But the person who bought it bought it in cash, and it was so
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.460]   much easier. There's no banks to deal with. There's no credit agencies to deal with. There's
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.980]   no back and forth on paperwork. When you pay in cash, you don't have to deal with any of
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.300]   that stuff. So, the bargaining power goes up immediately, because the other side doesn't
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.060]   have to deal as much with the bank. So, it's not as much of a headache. Obviously, having
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.780]   a house fully paid off at 24 puts you in a unique position. Brandon says he's single.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.280]   What happens if, down the road, Brandon gets a spouse? And that spouse says, "You bought
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.340]   this house for how much? I don't like it. I want to be in a different one." Maybe Brandon
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.740]   could rent it out, and that income could help pay for the new mortgage. Or sell it at a
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.360]   profit, maybe. So, the good news is that they're in a great financial position. I think no
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.120]   matter what you do here, you're going to be fine at 24. Especially if you continue maxing
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.260]   out that 401(k) and IRA. I did a little back of the envelope here for Brandon. So, if he's
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.500]   maxing out 401(k), that's $20,500 a year right now. IRA is $6,000. Those limits will change
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.540]   over time, but let's assume they don't. Let's assume Brandon, at 24, just continues to save
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:59.740]   that much every year. Nothing else. So, that's $26,500, from age 24 to age 60. Let's say
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.900]   he earns 7% a year on that. What does he end up with, Duncan?
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.260]   I've got to be honest, the firearm's going off, so I wasn't following.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:16.540]   Alright. That's not that loud. If he did that every year at a 7% annual return, he's going
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.300]   to have like $4 million by age 60. So, I'd say don't stress too much about this decision
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.380]   either way. You're going to be fine. Go with a more psychologically pleasing answer. But
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.460]   either way, if you keep saving, you're going to be fine. So, if you're worried about the
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.220]   stock market that much, you're 24 and you're still maxing out your retirement accounts
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.060]   and you want to pay for the house in cash, I think you're going to be fine as long as
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.540]   you keep saving. Do you think that's a common goal for people
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.220]   that young to want to buy a house in cash? I don't even think that had ever crossed my
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.820]   mind. Well, we talked about that person a few weeks
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.300]   ago emailed from Missouri and they were paying like $300 a month in rent. I think a lot of
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.500]   people here would be surprised to know that you could buy a house in cash for that much
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.620]   and there's still places that are relatively affordable. So, obviously, this is a very
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.860]   rare position. But I think with their finances so well in their mid-20s, they're probably
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:10.100]   going to be fine either way. Just keep saving. Yeah, I'd say so. That's not too loud, right?
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.580]   That's just them talking now. It sounds like you're at an airport.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:18.820]   Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, up next, we have the following. "I took advantage of a large dip
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.140]   and just opened a position in a market favorite, NVIDIA, with the intention of holding for
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:29.540]   10 to 20 years. I'm writing far out of the money calls and returning the premium less
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:35.020]   a portion for taxes to the position each week. As a first time options trader, this seems
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.460]   too easy. What am I missing? What's the catch? Thanks, and can we get a TCAF hoodie in black?"
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.460]   I have good news. Well, the bad news is I have no idea what you're talking about with
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.660]   options. The good news is we just added the black hoodie back to the shop. So, your wish
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   is granted. We also have a forest green one.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.740]   Hey, you know something about options. You know what OTM meant. That's the first abbreviation
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.740]   you've known about.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.740]   Trust me, I've lost plenty of money in options.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.980]   I said on Animal Spirits this week, I've actually never, I guess it's for a future show, I've
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.340]   never traded an option in my life for some reason. So, let's look at the textbook definition
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.580]   here. So, a call option gives the holder of that option the right but not the obligation
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.300]   to buy security at a predetermined price, right? That's if you buy the option. Now,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.660]   if you're a seller of the option, like this person, or a writer, I don't know why they
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.060]   call it writing, it's finance-speak, I guess. You're giving the buyer the option to buy
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.860]   your shares at a predetermined price. That seems like a free lunch, right? Those calls
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.020]   far out of the money, especially with a stock like NVIDIA that's so volatile, you're probably
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.780]   going to earn some pretty good premiums. Earn that sweet premium, and it feels like you're
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.940]   paying yourself an extra dividend stream, basically.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.580]   So, what's the downside? Well, the downside is you want to hold this stock for 10 to 20
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.620]   years. The downside is you could get taken out of these shares, right? You're obligated
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.380]   to sell those shares at the strike price, if it should hit. Now, option prices are based
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.380]   on a number of different variables, but one of the biggest variables is volatility. Generally
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.020]   speaking, the higher the volatility, the higher the price of the option. So, for you, that's
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.620]   good, because you're earning more income. But that could be bad, because the stock trades
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.580]   a lot. So, John, just throw up this chart of NVIDIA calendar year returns. This chart
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.500]   is just insane. Every single year for the past 12 years for NVIDIA, since 2012, has
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.740]   been a double-digit gain or loss. Six of the last eight years saw gains of 65% or more
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.640]   on a calendar year basis. Three of the last seven saw gains of 100% or more. And of course,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.700]   this year it's down 55%. In 2018, it was down 31%. In 2012, it was down 11%. I guess that's
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.980]   what happens with a stock that's up so much. So, your risk is that you rate some call options,
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.340]   and the stock breaks through those levels, causing you to sell the shares. I guess you
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:38.120]   have to ask yourself, is the amount of income I'm earning on that worth the hassle? Does
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:44.620]   it, you know, tax-wise, making more purchases, wanting to keep your position at a specific
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.380]   size? So, that's the cost-benefit there. Is the income stream I'm getting really worth
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.420]   the hassle of having to go through this and potentially buy back more shares if you want
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:58.340]   to keep that position where it is if you're going to be a holder for 10 to 20 years?
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:05.220]   To me, it's just hilarious. Every time I buy an option, it moves against me immediately.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.260]   I could probably harness that intuition and actually use it somehow to make money in the
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   stock market.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.260]   George Costanza, do the opposite.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.960]   Yeah, exactly. Every time. Every time.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.800]   I think for most people, trading options is kind of like gambling on sports. The great
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   thing about it is, you know exactly what you're going to get. It's like a parlay, basically.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.700]   You could put a little bit of money up, and if it's right, you earn a bunch of money.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.500]   If it's wrong, you just lose what you put up. I think that's the way most people these
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.960]   days in retail probably look at options, whereas professionals are looking at them more as
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.440]   a risk management tool and hedging and all these sorts of things. It sounds like this
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.260]   person is actually looking at them for income.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:46.020]   Yeah. No, it sounds like whatever they're doing is working so far. Hopefully, it continues
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.920]   to work for them.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.900]   Maybe that income is helping for Nvidia shares continuing to fall and get slotted this year.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.280]   Right, yeah.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280]   Next question.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.360]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Christy. "My husband and I are 34 and 40 years old,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.500]   healthy and planning on starting our family. We don't own a home yet, but hope to buy in
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.380]   two to three years. We have about $100,000 in assets between vehicles, retirement, and
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.580]   savings. As we start our family, should we set up a last will or a living trust estate
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.340]   plan? What do you think is better for this particular point in our lives, and why?"
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.740]   Hopefully, Christy and her husband will have a chance to buy houses at much lower prices
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:29.260]   if the Fed keeps raising rates. Let's bring in an estate planning expert here, Taylor
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.900]   Hollis from Red Bulls Wealth. She's been on the show before. Taylor's worked in estates.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.020]   All right. Christy and her husband do not have a family yet, but they're looking to
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.620]   start one soon. They're getting ahead of the game here, I think. What are they thinking
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.740]   about in terms of estate planning? When do you need to start thinking about this as a
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   young person?
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:53.360]   Yeah. I think the sooner, the better. Typically, even if you're not married, if you have any
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.700]   assets at all to your name, I think it always makes sense to have some sort of basic will
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.520]   in place just to give you control over what happens to those assets if you pass away.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.060]   Their question in particular is asking about the difference between setting up a living
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:17.180]   trust or just a basic will. I think that a living trust, which is also known as a revocable
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:23.920]   trust, is typically, in most cases, set up for two reasons. One, if there's a privacy
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:30.060]   concern, and two, to avoid probate in the estate settlement court, and specifically
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.180]   if you have property in multiple states.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.140]   Are those concerns mostly for people who have a lot of money and a lot of assets then?
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:43.140]   Typically, yeah. Just more complex. It's just a more complex situation. Typically, a living
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.020]   trust would make more sense. In their case, it sounds like a will can definitely accomplish
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.820]   what they need it to. The good news, a lot of people think they don't need to set up
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:58.500]   a will until they have kids, or until they own a home, or whatever it might be. Typically,
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.900]   attorneys can write the will in a way that covers all those future plans. It'll cover
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.940]   your future children. You can go ahead and factor all those things in now so that you're
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.300]   not having to redo it.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.820]   What's the simplest way for people to do this if they don't have a lawyer on call or something?
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.260]   How do people even go about this these days?
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:24.420]   I always defer to hiring an attorney for this. You can find attorneys these days that specialize
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.980]   in these simpler cases. Most people think they don't need an attorney if they do have
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.900]   a fairly simple situation, and they're like, "Can I just go on LegalZoom and do this?"
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:41.500]   Technically, yes, probably you could, but just as a professional, I always prefer people
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.660]   to actually work with an attorney on it. I think it's going to be less expensive than
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.180]   people may think if they find the right person.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.100]   Okay, that makes sense. All right, Duncan, one more question.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.980]   Yeah, last but not least. I think the firearm's done. I think we did it. We made it. We made
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.980]   it.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.980]   Way to go.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.900]   The loudest part of it, I think I was on mute for, so yeah. Okay, so last but not least,
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:09.940]   we have a question from Jason. "I'm a 37-year-old single male with $385,000 in my retirement
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:17.220]   accounts, $277,000 in my current company, 401(k), and $117,000 in my rollover IRA. I
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.180]   hope to be with my current company for many years to come. They have a 401(k) match of
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.140]   100% up to 10%." That's really good, right? Up to 10%, yeah.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.160]   10% is a really good match, yes.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   Really good.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.260]   "I maxed out my 401(k) in 2021, and I'm currently doing a mega backdoor Roth conversion. I call
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:41.180]   it an extra $35,000 over the max over a two-year span. After some due diligence," is that
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.180]   DD?
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.180]   I think that's what it'll concern, yep.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:49.620]   "After some due diligence on my rollover IRA, it has underperformed by roughly 7% compared
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.020]   to the S&P, and I'm paying professional fees of about $1,000 a year to Fidelity. I'm thinking
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.460]   I should take control and throw it all in a low-cost S&P fund and call it a day, or
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.580]   considering I can only contribute $6,000 a year into this and will be contributing much
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.660]   more in my 401(k), I could be more aggressive. Perhaps a mixture of S&P and also mid- and
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.860]   small-cap exposure. Would love your insights."
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.020]   A lot going on here. Now, sometimes we have to shorten these questions. This person also
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.980]   did ask, just generally, "How am I doing for retirement here?" Because they gave us a lot
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.740]   of information. And I think, "How am I doing?" is pretty much the only question that matters
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.820]   for the majority of people who are saving, if you're not uber-wealthy, if you don't have
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.220]   a ton of money, just FU money. I think a lot of people want to know just how they're doing.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.040]   I think Jason is doing pretty good for the amount of money they saved, and they're by
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.740]   themselves, and they're getting this huge max. So, the question is, it sounds like they're
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.060]   on the right path, but they're just unsure. I think that happens to a lot of people, Taylor.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.580]   Because there's so many options out there, I could be using Advisor, I could be having
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.180]   a different asset allocation, I could be using different funds. I think for a lot of people
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.100]   it's tempting to always think, "There's got to be more out there. What am I not doing?
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.500]   What could I be doing differently?" So, how do you help someone sort through all this
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.540]   stuff when they have six figures saved, it sounds like a pretty good plan, they're a
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.300]   pretty good saver, but then they need to take that extra step to make sure, "Is everything
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.340]   I'm doing, am I going to be okay?"
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.140]   Right, right. Yep. Very common question. A lot of FOMO, I think, baked into that for
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:20.620]   sure. He might not like this answer, but my first response to his question is, "What are
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.060]   your goals? You're young, you're an aggressive saver, you have a good pool of assets built
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:30.580]   up. Are you trying to retire early? Are you trying to be able to start your own business?
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.380]   What's the end goal?" And then let's work backwards from there, both in terms of your
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.860]   saving, which obviously you're doing a great job of, but especially your asset allocation
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.660]   in the investment plan. And I think that taking a holistic approach obviously makes a lot
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.140]   of sense. I think there's some mental accounting happening here. He mentioned, "Should my
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.740]   rollover IRA be more aggressive because it's smaller and I'm putting less into it?" To
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.620]   me, that doesn't necessarily matter and it should be viewed altogether. I think if anything,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.860]   your Roth component that you're building up through these mega backdoor contributions
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.600]   should be your most aggressive because you're theoretically never have to take money out
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.700]   of that. So in just a basic sense, we typically like to see the Roth as the more aggressive
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.860]   bucket. And then my next question in terms of his concerns on performance would be, "Well,
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.900]   what was it invested in that caused it to underperform?" But again, I think coming back
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.660]   to what your end goal is, what you're trying to accomplish is going to help you set an
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.400]   appropriate benchmark for yourself instead of just the market.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.320]   I feel like mega backdoor Roth is kind of like the sizes at Starbucks. Can we just call
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:47.200]   it a large Roth conversion? It's like a Venti. This is like a Venti Roth IRA. I don't know.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.500]   Someone did some good branding on that strategy.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.420]   Yes. It sounds like you're doing a lot with your money.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.900]   Sounds like Transformers.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.940]   So he said that he's paying an advisor to help him and he's underperforming. And I think
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.460]   maybe the question for that advisor is not, "Why am I underperforming?" It could just
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.900]   be because maybe they're invested in international funds and international funds are doing worse
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:12.660]   than the S&P. It's, "Can you help me put together an asset allocation that I can live with,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.380]   that I won't question all the time?" So maybe that's the question. If that advisor can't
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.100]   do it for you, maybe you have to find a new one or come up with something on your own.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.340]   But that's the thing for most people. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.020]   It's, "What's the asset allocation that I can stick with that I'm not going to tinker
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.740]   with, I'm not going to leave it alone?" I think the old saying, William Bernstein said
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.340]   it, "Asset allocation is like a piece of soap. The more you use it and fondle it and
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.300]   touch it, the smaller it's going to get." That's the same thing with your portfolio.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:47.100]   Sorry, I didn't mean to use the word "fondle." But I think we talked last week, too, for
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.500]   younger people in their 30s, if this person doesn't have a really complicated situation,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.620]   maybe they don't even need an advisor, as long as they can figure out an allocation.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.460]   And the other thing is, maybe you go backwards and go to a target date fund and let someone
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.100]   else handle that for you, and you don't have to think about it anymore.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.940]   Right. I think it sounds like he's doing all the right things. He's doing the things
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.860]   he's in control of, and that's saving a lot of money. Again, determine what the purpose
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.700]   is, what the goal is. Because with all of his savings, it sounds to me like maybe he
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.740]   wants to retire early.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.300]   Yeah, and that's the question in terms of, "How am I doing?" You're right. Focusing
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.220]   on what you can control in saving, for most people, that's the biggest piece. Right
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.420]   now, we can't control the Fed, we can't control interest rates, we can't control
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.740]   the stock market, and all that stuff is completely out of our control. Tax rates, none of that.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.220]   But if you can actually increase your savings in a time like this, that's pretty good.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.020]   So I think, as far as I'm concerned, they're doing pretty good.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   I was laughing because Toby in the chat said, "I hope this guy finds a way to make ends
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   meet."
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.180]   (laughs)
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:52.860]   Everyone has their cross to bear here. Listen, we get a wide range of questions from people,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.580]   and I know it is easy to judge people, but listen, we have people who have --
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.860]   Jason will laugh at that. He'll find that funny.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:06.220]   Yes. But we have people who have 10 figures in assets, and they constantly check their
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.420]   portfolio and they're worried about it. And one of the things that I say is, if you're
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.540]   still worried about your money, you're probably not wealthy in that sense. So I think for
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.260]   a lot of people, it's not the numbers so much that make sense, it's how they feel
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.540]   relative to their circumstances and all these things, and it's tough. So anyway. I think
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.100]   everyone on the questions today is doing a good job, right?
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.860]   Yes. No, we had some great ones. Keep them coming. And now that we're not doing viewer
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.360]   topics on what are your thoughts, we've made Portfolio Rescue that much more valuable.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.780]   This is the place you come to have your questions answered.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.420]   It's a premium show, Duncan.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.140]   Yes. We're a premium show now.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.660]   All right. I want to thank Taylor Hollis again for joining us.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   Thanks, Taylor.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.460]   From Nashville, Tennessee. We appreciate that. Thanks to everyone who was watching live in
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.180]   the chat. We appreciate you all. If you have a podcast for him, leave us a review. If you're
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.940]   on YouTube, leave us a comment, a question in the comment section. If you want some compound
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:01.380]   work, Duncan just said, breaking news, a new Compound & Friends sweatshirt, black sweatshirt,
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.380]   now available.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.980]   It's yeah, it's the same sweatshirt design. But yeah, we now have it. We had it in white
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.180]   for the summer. Now it's black and we have a forest green one. Very cool.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.260]   All right. And we'll have a new Compound & Friends tomorrow. Is that right?
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.940]   Right. We're doing it live from Market Watch's festival today. And so it's going to be basically
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.340]   the program feed from that.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.780]   Lots of live shows lately. Remember, if you have a question, email us askthecompoundshow@gmail.com
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   and we will see you next week.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   See everyone.
