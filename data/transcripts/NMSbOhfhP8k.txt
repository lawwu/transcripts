[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.840]   Welcome to the 11th episode of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.280]   Today, we have a special guest, one
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.320]   of the founders of the Bogleheads, Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.640]   I'll be talking with Mel about the incredible growth
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   of the Bogleheads over the years, in this country and abroad.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.520]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.160]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.080]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.880]   are brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.800]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800]   Today, we'll be talking with Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   Mel is one of the founders of the Bogleheads.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.400]   The Bogleheads are a global community
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.120]   of individual investors who help each other
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.680]   through forums, the incredibly in-depth Bogleheads Wiki.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.880]   There is this podcast, local meetings, national meetings.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360]   It's a global phenomena that just keeps getting better.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.840]   So let me introduce the prince of the Bogleheads, Mel Lindauer.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   Welcome, Mel.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.700]   Oh, it's great to be with you, Rick.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.080]   I love your podcast.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.440]   Thanks for all you're doing.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.640]   It's nice to be with you.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520]   Well, thank you for being on the program, Mel.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.640]   We're really excited to have you today.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.360]   You were Boglehead number two.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.180]   Boglehead number one was Taylor Larimore,
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.360]   who was a good friend of Jack Bogle's, who
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440]   started the Bogleheads many years ago on the Morningstar
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.960]   forum.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   But before we get to the history of the Bogleheads,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.520]   could you talk a little bit about your background?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.280]   I mean, you didn't come from the investment industry.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.200]   No, I didn't.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.120]   I ran a graphic art business in the Philadelphia area
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.760]   for 30 years.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   In 1968, started investing with a colleague friend
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.000]   who was a broker.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   And little did I know that the program he put me in
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.600]   was a 50% commission.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.680]   And they claimed that by paying the 50% up front that you--
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.840]   it was going to entice you to stay into the program.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.920]   So Mel, I remember that back when I was in the military.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.240]   Those 50% plans were called cafeteria plans.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.000]   Do you remember that phrase?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   I remember that well.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.680]   And in our later days, we fought against that
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.600]   to try to get them out of the military
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.040]   because they were taking advantage of our service people.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   And fortunately, I think that we succeeded.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920]   We raised such a ruckus that I think
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   Congress got-- or Senate got involved.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.560]   And I think they're no longer allowed on military bases,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.960]   if I'm correct.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   I think you are.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.000]   But go ahead and continue with your background.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.760]   I started investing in the late '60s with that program.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.160]   But when my business started doing well,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.200]   I thought that I should start learning more about investing.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.000]   So I started reading a lot of investing books, magazines,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.680]   and really became a student of investing.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.320]   So I started helping friends and relatives
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.120]   who asked for my help because I knew something about investing,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.240]   and they didn't.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.920]   And eventually, when I retired in 1997,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.600]   I turned the business over to my sons.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.680]   I was looking for some kind of charity work
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.600]   that I could do, volunteer work.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.360]   And that's how I got involved with the Morningstar Forum.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.240]   I figured that I could help out there
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.280]   by helping other people avoid all the mistakes
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.040]   that I made in my early years of investing.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.760]   The Morningstar Diehards Forum was the first Bogleheads Forum,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.440]   correct?
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.360]   At first, everything was on--
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.520]   it wasn't even called Bogleheads back then, was it?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.720]   That's right, because the people used
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.360]   to call us other forum members.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.280]   There were a lot of forums on Morningstar,
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.400]   and they used to make fun of us and call us Bogleheads,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.080]   and it was a derogatory term back then.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   We were as a badge of honor, but Morningstar
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.560]   thought since it was a derogatory term,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.840]   they didn't want to upset Jack by calling us the Bogleheads.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.280]   So they called us the Vanguard Diehards,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   and the subtitle of our forum was "Bogleheads Unite--
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.600]   Talk About Your Favorite Fund Company."
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.000]   We did not become the Bogleheads officially
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.760]   until we left Morningstar in 2007
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.720]   and started Bogleheads Org Forum.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   Could you just explain for just a few minutes
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   for people who are not familiar with what the Bogleheads are
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.120]   exactly what the organization is,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.400]   and who the people are that are behind it, the Bog--
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.200]   how big it is, I mean, how much it's grown?
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.840]   Well, the numbers are just phenomenal.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   We get something like 70,000 to 90,000 unique visitors
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.800]   a day on the forum.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.880]   The number of hits are in the millions.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.600]   So it has grown from a small organization
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.800]   to a very large organization.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.480]   We have about close to 100,000 registered members.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.640]   And any one time on the forum, we
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.280]   have about 10 guests for each registered forum
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   member that's online.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.040]   We get a couple thousand posts a day.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.160]   It's just grown phenomenally.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.360]   But basically, the Bogleheads is an organization
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.240]   of people who volunteer to help other investors.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   And we have no vested interests.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.480]   We don't sell anything.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.840]   We don't do-- we have no ads.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.600]   None of the board members, none of the officers
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.480]   get paid a penny either.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.920]   It's all volunteer work.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.720]   And I think that's very important.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.360]   So basically, this is funded by a nonprofit organization.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.640]   And the way expenses are paid are by donations.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.080]   So how would someone find out how to donate?
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.160]   Well, they would donate to the John C. Boglehead Center
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.480]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.240]   And the address is on the forum.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.520]   They can donate directly to the forum.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   It's not tax deductible.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.840]   If they donate to the John C. Boglehead Center
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   for Financial Literacy, and then we
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.400]   donate as part of our mission to support the forum,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.040]   it is a charitable deduction.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.360]   Who was it who came up with the idea of starting a forum that
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.440]   concentrated on low-fee investing,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.520]   or at that time at least, on Vanguard funds?
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.600]   The initial impetus for the Bogleheads on the Morningstar
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.080]   forum was Taylor Larimore.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.320]   The Bogleheads used to post on other forums,
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.560]   but they kept asking for their own forum.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.640]   And that's why Morningstar called our group the Diehards,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.040]   because we kept insisting on getting our own forum.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.760]   And that forum soon became the number one forum, the most
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.520]   popular forum on Morningstar.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.680]   The number of posts on that were greater than all
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.000]   of the other forums combined.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.680]   So it was really a thing that was led by Taylor.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.400]   Taylor is just one unique individual.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.720]   And Taylor and I got connected fairly early.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.760]   In the beginning, I joined shortly
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.880]   after the Diehards was set up.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   But I just wanted to lay in the background
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.520]   and see what was going on, and who was who,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.040]   and who knew what they were talking about, and so forth.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.960]   And there were questions about annuities
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.760]   that nobody answered.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.440]   So I thought, well, I know about annuities,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.160]   so I'll answer the questions.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.560]   So I started answering questions about annuities.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.800]   And then Taylor got in touch with me and said,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.240]   no, I really like the stuff you're doing.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.080]   Why don't we work together?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   And that's how Taylor and I ended up working together.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.320]   So when you said Taylor is one unique individual,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   what did you mean?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.360]   Yes, Taylor is a World War II vet.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.880]   He was in the Battle of the Bulge as a paratrooper.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.040]   And he and I, as I'm a Marine, he's a paratrooper.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.560]   We joke around a lot, but we really respect each other.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.040]   And he is the kind of guy that I would
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.520]   want to have my back anywhere.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.880]   He is a real gentleman, an ace.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.680]   Jack Bogle called him the King of the Bogleheads,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.200]   and it's a well-deserved title.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   I told Taylor many times, Jack called me
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.960]   the Prince of the Bogleheads.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.520]   And I told Taylor, I have no desire--
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.960]   this prince has no desire to be king.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.040]   So Taylor has to stick around as long as I'm around.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.880]   Well, one of the things that you started
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.680]   was a annual Bogleheads reunion.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   Yeah, that was kind of a strange occurrence.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.080]   I made a post in Thanksgiving of 1999
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.880]   on the Vanguard Diehards Morningstar Forum.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   And I listed all the things I was
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.520]   thankful for-- my wife, my kids, and so forth, and good fortune.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.880]   And a lot of people did the same thing.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.360]   Everybody was chiming in.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.600]   And we felt like we were a family, the Diehards.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.880]   Even though we didn't know each other,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.280]   we just felt like a family.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.520]   And Taylor chimed in and said basically the same thing
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   that most of us said.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.720]   We were thankful for our wife, and the kids,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.560]   and how lucky we'd been in life, and so forth.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.520]   But at the end, Taylor said, and I'm
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.360]   especially thankful to Jack Bogle for founding Vanguard,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.080]   because I live in the house that Jack built.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.000]   He calls his 35th floor condo overlooking Biscayne Bay
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   the house that Jack built. Jack Bogle saw that post.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.000]   Jack used to follow our forum on a somewhat regular basis.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.640]   He saw that post and replied to Taylor and asked Taylor
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.400]   if there was any interest in possibly getting together.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.600]   And for Taylor and I, this was like an invitation
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.960]   to the White House or an audience with the Pope
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.480]   for somebody of Jack's stature to ask if we would like
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.760]   to get together with him.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.440]   So Taylor knew that I was a snowbird in Florida
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.680]   in the winter.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   And he contacted me and said, Jack
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.280]   is going to be his keynote speaker at the Miami Herald
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   Making Money Seminar.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.440]   Do you think this would be a good opportunity for us
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.600]   to get together with him like he mentioned?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.760]   So I contacted the Miami Herald people
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.920]   and asked them if they could arrange something, a room
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.360]   for some of us to get together with Jack
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.040]   at lunch, for lunch, for maybe an hour or so.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.720]   And they kind of shooed us away as groupies
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.040]   and said that they had Jack too busy.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.320]   He didn't have time to get together with us.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.960]   So I called Jack's office and told them
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.800]   that they said that we couldn't get together.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.160]   And Jack said, well, I'll go wherever you want.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.880]   So now we decided to have the get together away
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.000]   from the Miami Herald Making Money Seminar.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.840]   And the Miami Herald people came patting hands and said, Mel,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   is there any chance we could send a reporter
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.800]   and a photographer to cover your event with Jack?
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.440]   So we hired a chef, a cook, and a maid
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.800]   and had to get together with Jack with about 22 or so
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.440]   bogleheads.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.480]   And it was a memorable evening.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.040]   Jack sat after dinner.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.080]   Jack sat in the living room.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   We were all around and asking questions and so forth.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.600]   And it was just really a night to remember.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.960]   So this all occurred in Taylor's condo.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.440]   And I had the good fortune of driving Jack from the hotel
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.800]   to Taylor's and then driving back after the event was over.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.840]   And you talk about being petrified of what
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.040]   I was going to say to this guy for a half hour or 40 minutes
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.720]   that it took to get to Taylor's house.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.960]   And I can tell you that Jack was the most gentle, easygoing,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.840]   unpretentious guy.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.560]   I knew he played golf.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.640]   And I mentioned golf.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.400]   And we started talking about golf.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.160]   But there was never a pregnant pause.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.560]   I mean, Jack was just so easy to talk to.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.360]   What a remarkable guy.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   And I had such a hard time calling him Jack.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.240]   He kept telling me to call him Jack.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.760]   He likes everybody to call him Jack.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.320]   But he was Mr. Bogle.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.840]   And it took a long, long time for me
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.480]   to be able to call him Jack.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.680]   Well, that would be understandable for two
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.760]   reasons, number one, who Jack Bogle was, but number two,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.600]   you are in that culture, right?
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.240]   I mean, Taylor tells me that you're a Kentucky colonel.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.920]   Is that correct?
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.520]   Yeah, that's correct.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.200]   I was honored by the governor of Kentucky some time ago.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.280]   I think it was in 1981 as a Kentucky colonel.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.600]   And my license, my Florida license plate
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.720]   is K-Y-C-O-L, Kentucky colonel.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   I am very proud of being a Kentucky colonel.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.680]   And I'm proud of my heritage and coming from Kentucky.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.240]   But yes, you're right.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.360]   We did say yes, sir and no, sir.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.240]   And of course, the Marine Corps reinforced that.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.960]   So the very first Boglehead reunion
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.480]   took place in Taylor Larimore's condo in Florida in 2000.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.120]   But these reunions have just grown substantially
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.000]   over 20 years.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.280]   And now, even what's going on now,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.840]   even though Jack has passed, reunions still
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.400]   seems to continue to grow.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.800]   We thought this would be a one-time-off.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.680]   Jack had offered to get together with us.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.440]   And so we had our reunion, and we
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.720]   thought that was the end of it.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.000]   But Jack posted using Taylor's computer that night talking
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.520]   about what a great night it was and how
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.400]   he loved being with his Bogleheads and so forth.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.320]   And the next thing you know, I got a request for Mel.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.720]   When's the next one?
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.360]   Well, I had no idea that there was going to be more than one.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.240]   But--
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.080]   Well, now you know there is.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.160]   Yeah, so I was approached by someone
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.240]   who I didn't know from the forum.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.320]   But he had inherited a farm in Pennsylvania near Vanguard.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.840]   So he offered his farm, and he wanted
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.880]   to host the Bogleheads for the second reunion.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.840]   So at that time, when he got in touch with me, I told him,
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.920]   I'm leaving for Florida.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.680]   I'll be gone for three months.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.560]   When I get back, we'll get together,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.000]   and we'll talk about it.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.920]   After I got back from Florida, I called,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.440]   and they told me that he had died while I was in Florida.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.600]   So I said, oh, well, just forget about it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.080]   And his family would not let it go.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.280]   They said they wanted to do it in his honor
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.240]   because that's what he wanted.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.200]   So our second reunion was at his farm
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   in Pennsylvania near Vanguard.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.680]   And several things happened there.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.360]   Jack took us on a tour of Vanguard,
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.440]   was our Vanguard tour director.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.880]   And Jason Zweig covered that for Money magazine.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.360]   He was with Money magazine at that time.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   And we ended up with a six- or eight-page spread
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.960]   in Money magazine titled "Here Come the Bogleheads."
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.680]   And it's still available online.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.200]   And that was the start of what continued
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.640]   to be, or what turned out to be, an annual or almost annual
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.560]   event.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.960]   We had the next one in conjunction with the Money Start
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.840]   Conference in Chicago.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.320]   The next one was in conjunction with the CFA Institute.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.920]   We had another one with the Money Show.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.960]   So all of the ones we did initially,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.400]   other than the first two, were done in conjunction with shows
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   where Jack was appearing.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.960]   In 2005-- and we couldn't find anywhere
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.600]   that Jack was appearing.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.200]   So then Jack got in touch with me and said, Mel,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.400]   when's our next conference?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.600]   And I said, well, we're trying to find something
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.040]   where you're speaking and tie in with that.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.720]   And that's when Jack said, I don't
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.840]   care about where I'm speaking.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.320]   I'll go wherever you guys want me.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.740]   And that was that we broke away from the shows
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.560]   and started doing our own shows.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.000]   We went to DC.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.080]   Then we went to San Diego.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.200]   And then after that, we went Dallas-Fort Worth.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.920]   And Dallas-Fort Worth was a really touching event
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.000]   because Jack was in the hospital.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.560]   Jack had made every one of our events.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.840]   And he told us that he wanted to speak to the crowd.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.160]   So we put a phone line in and wired it into the ballroom.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   And Jack called in at the appointed time.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.600]   Don't ask me how he got a phone in intensive care
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.840]   in the hospital.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.760]   But anyway, Jack called in.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.080]   And he talked to us for about 15 minutes.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.280]   So that was the only one that Jack missed.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   But being concerned for his health,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.120]   I thought that it best that we would keep him in Philadelphia
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.080]   so Jack didn't have to travel.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   And so all the conferences since then
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   have been held in Philadelphia where
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   Jack has not had to go cross-country or travel
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.520]   at all other than from his home.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.000]   So Mel, I understand that getting
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.280]   to one of these conferences is a pretty hot ticket
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.520]   in that there's a limited seating.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.560]   And in order to go to the conference,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.840]   as soon as the invitation goes out on the internet,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.340]   out on the Vogelheads forum, they
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.520]   have to almost immediately reserve their spot
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.640]   because these tickets are gone within a day.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.480]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.120]   We started out the first conference
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.680]   with about 20, 22 people.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.120]   And we liked the intimacy.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.640]   So I kept trying to enlarge the crowd a little bit at a time
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.960]   to find out if we were going to lose that intimate feeling
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   where people got a chance to talk
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.420]   to Jack and the authors that were there and so forth.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.640]   So we went from 20 to somewhere around 40 for the second one,
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.760]   maybe 60 for the third, 80.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.800]   And finally, we got to 200.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.200]   And at that point, I felt that anything larger than that,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.560]   we would lose the personal touch.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   So we now sell about 225 tickets.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.640]   And they go-- sometimes they've gone in as little as six hours.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.480]   This year, we sold out again despite the fact
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.180]   that Jack is not going to be there.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.680]   We still sold out in less than one day.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.880]   And we have a waiting list for people who are
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.280]   hoping that they can get in.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.640]   But we feel that the 200, somewhere around 200,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.760]   is the ideal number because people got to talk to Jack.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   They got to talk to people like you and Bill Bernstein
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:29.080]   and all of the authors and the people whose books they've read.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.820]   And it just works out that they get a chance
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.200]   to meet them and talk to them.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.520]   And we feel that that's one of the real important parts
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.080]   of the event.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.960]   I actually think I could sell out Yankee Stadium.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.400]   But we don't want that kind of event,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.200]   like Warren Buffett's event, where
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.720]   you have thousands and thousands and tens of thousands
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.400]   of people there.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.160]   But I just like the intimate feeling.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.480]   And everybody agreed that that was the ideal setup.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.280]   So yes, the tickets are scarcer than hen's teeth.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.440]   But one thing that you did set up several years ago
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.520]   was local chapters so that people
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.680]   could go locally and have the same intimate feeling
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.800]   and talk about a lot of the same topics.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.600]   Which, by the way, I wanted to clarify,
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.000]   the Bogleheads is not about Vanguard.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.520]   I mean, Jack Bogle was the founder of Vanguard.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.800]   But the Bogleheads is not a Vanguard fan club.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.960]   It espouses the virtues of Jack Bogle, not necessarily Vanguard.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.120]   Well, Vanguard says we're their biggest fans
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.200]   and their biggest critics.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.560]   And that's probably true.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.880]   The reason we like Vanguard and mention Vanguard a lot
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.840]   is because of the low cost and their indexing and so forth
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.080]   and their corporate structure, which the way it's set up
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.280]   is unique.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.640]   But we have mentioned and we feel
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.160]   that there are certainly other places, especially
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.920]   when people don't have access to Vanguard,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.440]   there are other companies that we respect.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.080]   But the main thing we look for is low cost,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.360]   because cost matters.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   And of course, we are fans of indexing.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.080]   But there are other companies, and we mention them
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.000]   in some of our books.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.480]   So if Vanguard does something wrong,
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   they're going to hear about it, and they're
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.800]   going to read about it on the bogleheads.org forum.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.360]   So we are friends.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.520]   We've probably driven tons and tons and billions, possibly,
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.800]   of money to Vanguard simply because we
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.120]   were getting people out of bad situations
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.520]   into good situations.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.600]   But we also recommend Fidelity and some of the other places
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.320]   where they have good choices available.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.760]   I think that, in many ways, Vanguard was the leader,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.480]   and it's really helped to drive down cost everywhere.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.760]   But it's become, in many ways, more of a level playing field
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.000]   where you have indexing products at Schwab, Fidelity.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.600]   You've got ETF companies like iShares.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   Everyone has come way down in price and access
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.040]   to extremely low cost index investing.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.760]   And of course, Vanguard was the leader driving that.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.040]   I agree, a lot of people don't have access to Vanguard.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.080]   But there are a lot of good funds
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.880]   and a lot of good companies everywhere now,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   because it has become much more of a level playing field.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.560]   Exactly, and I credit Jack.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.040]   And our message has gotten across, too.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.880]   I'm sure that we had some impact on that,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.040]   the bogleheads forums have.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.060]   So it's good.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's good for all investors, whether they
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.000]   are at Vanguard or Fidelity or at Schwab or wherever they are.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.840]   It's good that they're focusing on costs.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.520]   So we feel that we might have had some little--
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.320]   played a little part in that.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.520]   That was Jack's mission.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.680]   And what we tried to do is carry on Jack's mission
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.560]   and spread the word.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.920]   So helping to spread the word, let's
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.880]   talk about local chapters.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.520]   A lot of people can't make it to the annual conference
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.120]   or they can't get a ticket to the annual conference.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   But there are local chapters now all over the country.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.000]   In fact, even all over the world now, chapters have begun.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.640]   Yeah, that's one of the things that I'm proudest of
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.400]   is setting these chapters up.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.720]   We have close to 100 now.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.840]   And we have them in foreign countries.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.320]   I think we have six, maybe six or seven foreign chapters.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.360]   And we have chapters all around the country.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   And these chapters meet on their own.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   And they do basically what we do in the conference.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.440]   They get together and they talk about things
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.200]   that they're interested in.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.120]   We do not dictate their meeting frequency or their agendas
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.720]   or anything.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.960]   They're kind of on their own.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.880]   But usually, I try to pick a coordinator from the forum.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.400]   And the members come from the forum.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.560]   So it's an extension of the forum,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.520]   but where people get to meet in person
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.800]   and talk about things that are important to them
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.640]   and find out that there are other people just
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.840]   like them in Sioux Falls, Idaho, or wherever it happens to be.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.360]   I think it's really great because it also
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.080]   brings in other people.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.240]   It brings spouses in.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.440]   A lot of the conference, a lot of the Bogo Heads local chapter
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.240]   meetings, couples come.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.960]   And it brings maybe a spouse in that's
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.920]   not really interested in learning about investing.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.080]   But it's a social event, too.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   And they go and they pick up and say, oh, this is interesting.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.640]   So I think it's a great extension of our forum
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.400]   and our conferences.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.840]   And it's one of the things that I am most satisfied
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.760]   in the way it turned out.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.400]   And there are even local chapters
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.560]   overseas in several countries.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.920]   And I understand that some of these countries
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.680]   are even starting their own Bogo Heads conferences now.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.760]   Yes, and some of them, they send me information on these.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.480]   And some of these things look like they
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.440]   are bigger than our conferences because they
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.800]   don't put a limit on it.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.640]   And I've seen some of these things in stadium seating
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.040]   that looks like it goes forever.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   So that's the United Arab Emirates in Dubai.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.160]   But we have-- and in one of the conferences,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.880]   when I was doing book signings at one of our conferences,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.440]   when I was doing book signings, a guy came up to me
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.600]   and handed me a book.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.400]   And I didn't recognize the book.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.920]   And it turns out that he was giving me the book.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.520]   He was the chapter leader in Taiwan.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.440]   So yeah, I mean, we've had people
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.160]   from some of the other countries come over,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.320]   some of the local chapters come to our conferences.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.880]   So it's a great thing.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.040]   I really think that Taylor and I can
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.680]   be really proud of the little seed we planted
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.520]   and the way it's grown, and just so many people that
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.360]   are getting involved, like you and Bill Bernstein and all
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.200]   of the other people.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.600]   Jason has been a good friend of the Bogoheads.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.400]   He's written so many great columns about it.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.560]   Jonathan Clements has always been a Bogoheads favorite,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.080]   writing his columns in The Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.840]   And Christine Benz, too, from Morningstar.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.760]   It's been so great to see all of these people who
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.320]   have large readerships spreading the message, too.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   So--
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.560]   Mel, you mentioned books several times.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.960]   Can you talk about the different Bogohead books?
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.560]   And you talked about the authors.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.480]   Can you talk about the authors?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.880]   Initially, I got a call, and the guy identified himself
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.360]   as Bill Faloon from Lolly Publishing.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.000]   And he said, I'd like you to do a book.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.920]   And I'm thinking, I know there are hundreds of thousands
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.000]   of people who've written books and can't get them published.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.800]   And I get a guy calling me out of the blue
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.320]   asking me to write a book.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   I hung up on him.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.600]   I thought it was a hoax.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.880]   So he wouldn't take no for an answer.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.000]   He kept calling back.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.800]   And one time, he called back, and he mentioned--
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.280]   he said, don't hang up, Taylor Larimore.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.320]   And when he said Taylor, I figured, well,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.240]   he must know something.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.280]   Anyway, it was Bill Faloon from Wally Publishing,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.360]   a legitimate publisher, who wanted us to do a book.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.600]   And I was leery of doing a book because I told him,
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   there are tons and tons of books out there written
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.240]   by people who are much, much smarter than we are.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.280]   And why would you want somebody like us to write a book?
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.040]   I said, the only way I will write a book
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.480]   is if we can assume that people know nothing.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.920]   And we are going to write at that level
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.480]   because books like Bill Bernstein's first book,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.360]   with all the math in it, I said, it's a brilliant book.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.640]   He's a brilliant guy.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.920]   But if people can't understand it,
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.240]   they just put the book down.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.360]   Their eyes glaze over.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.800]   It goes right over their head.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.440]   And the book is not useful.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.600]   So there are plenty of those kinds of books
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.400]   out there for the people who want the high end.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.960]   I said, the only way I would consider doing it
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.000]   would be if we could write at a level
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.720]   that assumed people knew nothing.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.200]   So they agreed to that.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.880]   So we agreed to do the book.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.560]   We brought Michael LaBoeuf in as a co-author.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.680]   And the three of us did the book.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.520]   Well, the book was successful in the US.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.480]   And it started being published in foreign languages.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.960]   And I was getting books showing up in a box on my porch
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.440]   that I didn't recognize.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.480]   And it turned out they were the foreign version.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.920]   So the book has been very successful.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.360]   And it's been printed in a number of different languages.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.320]   And hopefully, our message, Jack Bogle's message,
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.120]   is getting spread around the world.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.280]   But the book, one of the things that I'm most proud of
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   is when I read the reviews on Amazon
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.960]   where people say that I could understand the book.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.720]   They didn't talk down to me, which
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.240]   means we were on target because that's exactly the audience
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.860]   that we wanted, people who needed guidance
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.320]   and didn't feel that this was rocket science.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   So the first Bogleheads book is still out there.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.720]   It's now in its second printing, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.120]   or its second edition.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.520]   There was another book.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   And I know there was another book
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.480]   because I was involved in the other book.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.080]   You certainly were, you and the queen of the Bogleheads, Laura,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.280]   and Taylor, and I. And I thought this
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.680]   was the perfect opportunity to display
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.880]   the talents of the people who were on the Bogleheads forum.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   So what we did is created the outline.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.480]   And we had people volunteer to write a chapter.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.240]   Sometimes it was two or three people
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.640]   work together on a chapter where they had expertise.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.120]   So that book is a showcase of the talents that are
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.480]   on the Bogleheads.org forum.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.640]   Every chapter in there was written by people
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.680]   who are on the forum and give free advice.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.080]   And our job was to put it all together and make it read
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.560]   like one person wrote it.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.960]   But each person got credit for the chapters
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   they wrote in the chapter.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.480]   So it was a community effort.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.240]   And I'm very proud of the way that book turned out.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.560]   So just to clarify for me, if you will,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.080]   the title of the first book and then
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.320]   the title of the second book.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.760]   The first book was The Bogleheads Guide to Investing.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.360]   And the second book was The Bogleheads
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.680]   Guide to Retirement Planning.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.480]   There's a third book now, which Taylor put out,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.240]   which is The Bogleheads Guide to the Three Fund Portfolio.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.360]   It was his lifelong effort, if you will.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.040]   So let's continue to move on and talk
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.400]   about how the Bogleheads continues
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.840]   to expand in many different directions.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.080]   And one, which is incredibly impressive,
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.160]   is the amount of information and content
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.360]   that is available on the Bogleheads wiki site.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.280]   Oh, yeah, that's a treasure trove of information.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:31.880]   And it is, again, a joint effort by people,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.520]   knowledgeable people, knowledgeable Bogleheads,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.920]   who volunteer to write the articles, to edit the articles,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.720]   to keep them up to date.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.000]   And this will live on long, long after we're all gone.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.520]   And hopefully people are making use of it.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.200]   We're getting lots of reads and hits on it.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.560]   And it just continues to expand.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.200]   And more and more people are becoming wiki editors.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.400]   And it's just an extension, if you will,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.120]   of The Bogleheads Guide to Retirement Planning, which
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.360]   showcased a number of authors.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.680]   This is showcasing the wealth of knowledge
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.960]   that's available on the Bogleheads Forum
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.280]   on a regular, everyday basis.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.840]   Not only does it have retirement planning information,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.440]   but there's 529 plans.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.880]   There's all kinds of information about the tax efficiency
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.680]   of various Vanguard funds and other ETFs.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.880]   Just you name it, if you're looking
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.360]   for good quality, unbiased, uncommercial information
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.160]   about low-cost investing, I mean,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.000]   the Boglehead wiki is just a phenomenal resource.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.720]   I just can't get over how much information is there.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.520]   And it's free.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.720]   And you can read it at your pace.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.240]   There's another thing there, too.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.920]   If you wanted to see the history of the Bogleheads conferences,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.160]   there's videotapes on there.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.280]   You can go right through the history of all the conferences
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.400]   and so forth.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.880]   In the early days, we had transcripts
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.080]   of what happened, what was said, what Jack talked about,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.320]   the Q&As and so forth.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.240]   So there's a wealth of information there,
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.480]   both from a historical standpoint,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.720]   going back to the first Bogleheads conference,
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.520]   up through today's.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.360]   So you could spend hours and hours and hours on there
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.680]   and never, ever begin to touch all the information that's
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.760]   available there.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.800]   I highly recommend it to people who have time to read
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.840]   and want to study.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.600]   And sometimes you have to read before you even
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.760]   know what the questions are.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.960]   So you can read some of that information.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.560]   And then you can go on the forum and ask a question about it.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.600]   And you might be getting an answer
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   from the same person who wrote the wiki article.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.000]   I also want to add that it's not only in the US now.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.120]   The wiki has extended internationally.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.720]   There is a Canadian web ring.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.600]   There's other countries now that are adding content
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.000]   to the wiki.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.720]   It's just phenomenal.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.760]   We now have a Spanish forum.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.720]   And we have a United Arab Emirates forum.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.440]   So these are subforums now on our forum
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.400]   where people come on bogleheads.org
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.920]   from the United Arab Emirates.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.880]   And they talk to each other.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.520]   Some people who are in the US wanting
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.800]   to go to the retarded Emirates, they're
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.440]   learning about investing there.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.720]   So there are subforums on our main forum
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.800]   for Spain and Canada and the United Arab Emirates now.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.520]   So yes, our reach is international,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.800]   both in the chapters, but also on the main forum now.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.560]   I'd also like to add that I had guests from the UK
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.800]   on the Bogleheads forum last month.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.200]   And Robin Powell from the UK is interested in starting
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.720]   a UK forum on the Bogleheads.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.240]   So hopefully, we can connect that together.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.160]   Because there's a lot of people in the UK now,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.520]   especially with all the changes of the laws over there,
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.480]   where indexing and low-cost investing
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.880]   now is just starting to become very popular.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   So this Bogleheads phenomenon, the Bogleheads wiki,
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.360]   the bogleheads.org site, the conferences, the local chapters
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.280]   is just growing and growing.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.480]   I do want to make one plug for something that's on the wiki
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:33.880]   that's called "Taylor's Gems," which Taylor has spent years
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.120]   collecting, reading books.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.620]   And maybe you could comment on that.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.160]   It's just an incredible collection
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.640]   that Taylor has put together.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.040]   Taylor used to go to the library--
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.880]   I think it was every Saturday--
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.560]   and read books.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.160]   And he has read so many books over the years.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.720]   And he picks out key elements, things
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.160]   that strike him as being important.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.680]   And he makes notes of these.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.200]   And they're called "Taylor's Gems."
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.560]   And each book that he reads, he might end up
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.200]   with 20, or 30, or even 50 of "Taylor's Gems."
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.560]   And when he posts these on the forum,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.040]   they're available now for everybody.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.640]   And basically, this is Taylor's summary of whatever book
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.920]   it was he read.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.520]   So if you want to get the key elements of any particular
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.040]   book, all you have to do is look through "Taylor's Gems."
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.280]   And you'll find something that really strikes your interest.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.720]   Then you go get the book.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.280]   I was just on the wiki site.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.960]   And there's lists of dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.480]   of investment books and finance books
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.440]   for individual investors.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   And next to it are "Taylor's Gems."
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.080]   So if you want to just read a little bit about what
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.400]   the book's about, you can just click on "Taylor's Gems."
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.360]   And you can read.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.720]   Because he's already read it.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.580]   If it's out there, he's read it.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.920]   And he's taken notes.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.400]   And he's putting them up there on the bogleheads.org forum.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.880]   And also, the people who are putting up
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.360]   content for the wiki have taken his gems
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.600]   and have put them on the wiki.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.280]   And by the way, the transcripts from these podcasts
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.080]   that I'm doing are also now being put up on the wiki.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.920]   So everything's up there.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.720]   These are things that are going to be available for people
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.800]   long after we're gone.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.680]   And I'm so thrilled to see all this happening.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.660]   And your podcasts are--
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.660]   that's today.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.740]   Today, people want to listen to podcasts.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.480]   And it's great.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.980]   I mean, you're doing a super job.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.900]   And I'm really thankful for you stepping up and doing this.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.740]   It's just another tool in our tool belt of educating
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.300]   investors.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.220]   Yep, it's people helping people.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.820]   So Mel, just to be very clear, the Bogleheads
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.860]   are a non-commercial site.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.500]   And there is no one getting paid.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.740]   And also, a lot of this is part of the nonprofit organization.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.580]   So could you talk about those two things?
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:09.300]   Yeah, the Bogleheads forum, no one gets paid for giving
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.200]   advice.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.500]   No one gets paid for commercials.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:19.100]   No one in the Bogleheads organization makes any money.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.660]   No one is paid anything.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.380]   The same thing is true for the John C. Bogleheads Center
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.180]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.620]   It's a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.020]   approved by the IRS.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.540]   We can take donations.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:45.620]   And we use our donations to help support the forum.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:51.180]   And for educational purposes, to try to spread the word any way
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.380]   we can.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:58.540]   And also, the Bogleheads Center puts on the annual conferences.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.700]   Mel, you've done a fabulous job.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.180]   You and Taylor have done a fabulous job
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.820]   getting the Bogleheads up and running and just pushing
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.660]   this thing along for 20 years.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   You're to be commended.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.580]   It's a crusade that Jack started.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.820]   And it's turned into a freight train that just keeps
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.900]   on picking up boxcars and moving faster and faster down the track.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.660]   In the 20 plus years I've been involved in it,
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.180]   it went from a really small thing to what
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.700]   I feel now is something that will carry on long after I'm
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.200]   gone.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.100]   And we've got people like you and others
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.140]   that are spreading the message.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.460]   And hopefully, you guys will be carrying it on
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.060]   after we're gone.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.300]   But you can outlive me, Mel, so I don't have to worry about that.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.020]   Well, my goal is, Rick--
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.820]   I know you're a pickleball player.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.260]   And you're a higher ranked pickleball player than I am.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.980]   However, I'm pretty good for my age.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.220]   And I can hold my own.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.620]   And there's not many guys my age that can keep up with me.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.940]   My goal is to be playing pickleball at 100.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.140]   Well, that would be great.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.700]   And I'm doing everything I can to stay in shape.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.140]   I play pickleball a couple hours a day.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.220]   I walk four miles on the beach.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.660]   And I'm doing all I can to reach my goal.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.340]   I told Taylor, I said, Taylor, I'll make a deal with you.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.300]   I'll come to your 100th if you come to my 100th.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.100]   Taylor, of course, we have to clarify,
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   Taylor is 95 or 96 years old?
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.020]   Yeah, he is, and I'm 81, so.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.700]   Mel, I really appreciate the time today that you've taken
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.180]   and what you've done to help investors educate themselves
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.380]   and avoid all the biases that take place out there,
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.540]   all the noise that happens out there.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.660]   And thank you for everything you've
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.980]   done for continuing to spread the word.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.900]   And I know you're going to be doing this for a long, long
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.740]   time.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.620]   Well, Rick, it's been great being with you.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.820]   And I want to thank you for your service
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.020]   and for everything you've done for the Bogleheads.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.020]   You're an important part, and I'm
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.780]   looking forward to seeing you in October in Philly.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.380]   Thank you, Mel.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.060]   This concludes the 11th episode of Bogleheads on investing.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.300]   I'm your host, Rick Ferry.

[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.780]   [MUSIC ENDS]
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.360]   (upbeat music)
