[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Well, next Tuesday we celebrate July 4th, Independence Day as it's known for us in
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.120]   the United States here and the day itself raises questions about national loyalty for
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.360]   those of us who are Christians, who are strangers and exiles, aliens, pilgrims in this earth.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.600]   Pilgrims and patriots, that was our topic back in years past, back in episode number
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.920]   378 we talked about that.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   But this year we want to take a closer look at patriotism in the local church and the
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   time seems right to pick up this important email from a pastor named Scott who writes
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.560]   in to ask this, "Pastor John, are there any acceptable displays of patriotism in a
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.200]   church service?
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.840]   I was brought up in a very conservative and patriotic background in which every patriotic
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   holiday was celebrated in a Sunday church service, including 4th of July, Veterans Day,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.880]   Memorial Day, the anniversary of 9/11, etc.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.680]   Events like pledging the flag and singing patriotic songs were heavily used.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.680]   Is this okay?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.040]   I pastor a church that has a history of this, but it makes me somewhat uncomfortable.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Scott?"
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.480]   Scott, I've been in several churches recently, not just growing up, especially in the South,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.720]   I'm thinking, because that's just my experience, where on the 4th of July the focus on the
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.800]   branches of the armed forces seemed to me uninformed, unshaped by the radical nature
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.520]   of the gospel, and out of proportion to the relationship between America and the kingdom
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.480]   of Christ, and so I share your discomfort.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200]   Indeed, it is more than discomfort, I think.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.040]   There are real biblical principles at stake, and so it will be helpful, I think, to face
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   those principles, and then we'll see if there's time to deal with practical transition issues
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.400]   in a church.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   So let me say a word about principles.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.320]   One, when we're born again, we are united to Christ, our King, and we are delivered
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.520]   from the domain of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God so that
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:28.800]   now it can be said with glorious and profound reality, our citizenship is in heaven, Philippians
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.900]   3.20.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.280]   Number two, therefore, wherever we live on earth, whatever country, whatever tribe, whatever
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:49.260]   family or clan, we are in all of that pilgrims, sojourners, refugees, exiles.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.880]   Our first identity is with the King of the universe, not any country or nationality or
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.440]   political party or governmental regime.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.460]   America is emphatically not our primary home or primary identity.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.360]   That should be spoken, it should be felt, and it should be precious.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.760]   We should never be ashamed of identifying first and foremost as citizens of the kingdom
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.560]   of Christ, the kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.420]   Number three, Jesus Christ, therefore, is our absolute Lord.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.760]   We swear absolute allegiance to him and to no one and nothing else.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.920]   All other commitments are relativized.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.440]   To be sure, citizens should submit to the laws of their government.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.360]   Employees should submit to the rules of the employer.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   Wives should submit to husbands.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   Children should submit to parents.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   Church members should submit to the elders of the church.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   But none of these commitments of submission is absolute.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.600]   All of those authorities are subordinate and secondary to the authority of Christ, and
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   therefore, all submission is qualified.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.520]   Submission over every commitment for the Christian is unless Jesus commands otherwise.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   Number four, therefore, there's no unqualified allegiance to any political party, any nationality
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.280]   or any ethnicity or any tribal identity or any branch of the armed service.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.520]   It is all qualified.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.480]   It is all secondary.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.400]   It is all relative to the will of Christ.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   We should not say anything or do anything that looks as though that were not true.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   Five, therefore, the question of what to do when the people of God are gathered to worship
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:14.360]   Jesus Christ on the Lord's Day is not merely a question of whether a particular act is
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.520]   permissible in general with all of those qualifications that I just mentioned, but whether it belongs
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:31.140]   in a worship service where the focus is on the absolute lordship of Jesus and worshiping
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.680]   and praising and honoring him.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.200]   My own opinion is that any pledge of allegiance, like the one to the American flag, does not
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.940]   belong in a worship service that's called to the highlighting of the absolute allegiance
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:56.160]   that we have to Jesus, even though the pledge says that the nation is under God.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   Nevertheless, what is being highlighted and foregrounded is an earthly allegiance, and
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.840]   the recitation of a pledge to a human authority in the setting of the worship of divine authority
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.260]   does not provide for the kind of Christian qualifications and nuances that are so necessary
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.680]   precisely in our day.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.840]   Number six, whenever Christians pay tribute to earthly blessings like American freedoms,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.960]   which are wonderful, and the sacrifices made to have them, and the people who made those
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:45.860]   sacrifices, the emphasis should be on humble thankfulness to God, who is great and in his
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.880]   great mercy has given us what we don't deserve.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.160]   When he gave them, we didn't deserve them.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.660]   We don't deserve them at this moment that we're enjoying them, and therefore words
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:09.880]   and songs should have no triumphalist or assertive tone, especially not for any military expression,
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   but rather should have a feel of humility and lowliness and dependence and thankfulness,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.880]   along with a suitable call to repentance and need for ongoing mercy.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:33.840]   And the last thing I would say, number seven, in and over everything we do and say in our
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.480]   worship services, especially the ones that give thanks for American blessings and privileges,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.840]   there should be the dominant expression of the work of Jesus Christ, the gospel, to forgive
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:57.760]   American sins and American sinners like us, and a call to make Jesus supreme in this particular
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:04.400]   service we are in and over the hearts of the people and over the land.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.260]   Now those are some of the biblical principles that I think should shape our expressions
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.400]   of thankfulness for America in worship.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:22.280]   And I realize now I'm out of time and I haven't even touched on what is probably this pastor's
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.640]   most painful situation is.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.360]   I've inherited a church where things don't seem to be in proper proportion, and I'd like
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   some practical help.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.440]   And so I'm going to do that in another APJ.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.360]   Yeah, let's go ahead and plan on doing that Friday, Pastor John.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.720]   And thanks for the question, Scott.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.680]   We'll be back to address it more next time.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.560]   As you can hear, we're working through some audio issues on Pastor John's end, and thank
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.780]   you for your patience as we work through those.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.440]   You can subscribe to the audio feed, so you can search our episode archive, and you can
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.880]   even reach us by email with a difficult question you may be facing in life or in your local
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   church.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.400]   Do all that through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.720]   We'll return Friday to look at the practicals of what we introduced here.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.280]   We'll see you on Friday.
