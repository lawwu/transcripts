[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Do the credit card companies like power users because they tell their friends
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.880]   and their friends aren't?
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.200]   Or do they like secretly wish that they could put a red flag
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200]   on all of our accounts and close us all down?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.720]   I think we represent such a small number that they probably don't care.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.360]   I think it's like reminiscent of the casinos where there's people
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.600]   that can't count cards.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   You actually want people to think that they can go in and count cards
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880]   and like movies that's like propagate.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.120]   But like the average person, just even if they mentally can to it,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.280]   they're not going to spend the time to learn how to do it.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.680]   So by having this whole thing like, oh, you can get money,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.320]   but maybe they don't do enough research, then they end up losing.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800]   But the people that watch videos and like read blogs
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.520]   are probably already a lot ahead of everyone else.
