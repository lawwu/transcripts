[00:05:47.440 --> 00:06:17.440]  berger: this is going to be hard for you to do if you live in certain intense cities. In the city environment, that's where you start to get into your multi-unit houses where you have three houses stacked up on one another and you have opportunities there, you convert the basement and rent it out, but you already know some of those things. But if you get out where you have a little bit of land, oftentimes you could find a housing that the house itself would work well for one tenant with a family or a couple of

[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.880]   cool idea.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.960]   If you use that property with an eye towards the future,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.920]   then
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.200]   you could buy one property and then it just adjust and expand as needed.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.260]   So here's what I would consider. Let's say I were single
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.800]   and I were young
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.420]   and I were very flexible.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.440]   I would buy a house
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.880]   that was the type of house and the type of neighborhood that I thought I might want to be
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.540]   when I were older.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.480]   But I would try to buy a house that had a main courtyard
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:47.500]   a house that had a house that also had a carriage house or a mother-in-law quarters out back. Then I would try to rent out the main house. And then I would put the carriage house also up for rent. And I would move, let's say, an older travel trailer into the yard. It's a property where big enough that this could be done in an appropriate way. Go ahead and plumb it into the septic system so you had all your hookups ready to go. And I would live in that travel trailer myself while I was young and flexible and I would keep the other homes in the same place.
