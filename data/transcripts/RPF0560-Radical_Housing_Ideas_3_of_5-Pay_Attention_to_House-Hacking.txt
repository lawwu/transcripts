[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Joshua. I'm your host.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And today we continue with part 3 of a very small real estate series dedicated to radical housing ideas.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Some ideas that I hope will provide you with grist for your creative mill that will allow you to think about your situation and figure out how can you get more for less.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Today I want to cover the topic of what is usually referred to in the online financial community these days as "house hacking."
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So, of course, we have this idea of hacking being a way to get more with fewer inputs, a way to creatively string together certain things so that you can get more benefits.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hack this, hack that. That's the common use.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And this idea of house hacking is usually used to refer to the idea of buying a house, moving into it, and filling your house with roommates so that you can gain rental income from roommates while also having a place to live in.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And I think it's a really worthy idea that most people should and can pursue.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And I encourage you to consider it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There is a learning curve, but I think the risk of doing this is relatively low for many people, especially if you're careful.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   First, you'll need the stability of income in order to qualify for financing if you don't have the money to just simply pay for housing.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But you'll need stability of income to qualify for financing so that you can actually purchase a house or some type of housing, appropriate real estate.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And you can do this with something as simple as a standard residential house.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You can also do this with an apartment, or you can do this with a multi-unit building.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But if you'll go ahead and purchase a home and then seek to fill that house with roommates, that can be a really compelling way for you to control an asset that hopefully will appreciate in value while also profiting.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   A lot of people have done this.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But if you're going out and renting an apartment, a retail apartment, and paying $1,000 a month, why don't you go ahead and buy an apartment or a condo or a house with three bedrooms?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And let's say that instead of renting that same apartment where I would rent where I live, the rental on a three-bedroom condo would be about $1,600 a month.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Let's say that your financing costs on such an apartment are $1,800 a month.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, you could easily rent out two of the bedrooms for $700 a month or $1,400, and now your net cost drops down to about $400 a month.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And you control that asset, which may appreciate in value in the future.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So you have a lower net cost to you, and you have control of an asset that may appreciate.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Now look around your neighborhood and try to figure out what would be the best way to do it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You may do this with a single-family house.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You may do this with a house that has multiple units, a garage unit in the back.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You may do this with a condo.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You may do this with any kinds of real estate.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You can even get into the multifamily world.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I know of somebody who very early on, they bought a duplex.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It was a very modest duplex.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But one side of the duplex had a two-unit apartment.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The other side of the duplex had a three-unit apartment.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And this particular duplex was very well suited to filling essentially each of the bedrooms with a tenant.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   If you have five bedrooms, you can rent out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And if you have the stability that can handle unstable renters, maybe it's a college town or something like that,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   then you can have a major source of income.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I don't see much reason for people who are not wealthy to own their own house that they only live in.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Now for some people, this is very important, but it usually seems to be important as kind of a status symbol.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Some people feel like once they've reached a certain point of earning, that this is their reward to themselves,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   to have a beautiful house that's all theirs.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's fine. I don't deny you. It's your money. You get to control it.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But it sure doesn't sound like much fun to me.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I've always found that some of the most enjoyable times in my life are the times when I'm with other people who I like.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   If you ask most people when they had some of the most fun, it's often when they were in college,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   when they're surrounded by other people who don't have a lot of responsibility, who have a whole lot of time,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and they're very available to one another.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Well, if you give me the choice of living alone in a big five-bedroom house or having four roommates
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   who I've carefully chosen that are people that I want to live with and are paying me money,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   every time I'll choose the four roommates.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Now I'm more flexible in my thinking than other people might be, but you might also be flexible like I am.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So consider this and consider is there a way that in your next housing move you can go ahead and purchase a house
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that is designed with the idea of you being able to live in it and function well in it and also to rent it out.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Now here's a bonus point for you.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Here I think you have bonus points and bonus opportunities for property that has multiple structures.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   This is going to be hard for you to do if you live in certain intense cities.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   In the city environment, that's where you start to get into your multi-unit houses where you have three houses
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   stacked up on one another and you have opportunities there.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You convert the basement and rent it out, but you already know some of those things.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But if you get out where you have a little bit of land, oftentimes you could find a housing
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   that the house itself would work well for one tenant with a family or a couple of tenants.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And perhaps there's another unit on the property, a mother-in-law quarters or some sort of carriage house
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   that would also work well for a unit.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And then perhaps you could also use the land and use it as a place for you to have an additional type of housing unit,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   whether that's a single wide trailer or you park an RV in the yard.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   There are a lot of opportunities that you could use the same piece of property and put multiple tenants into it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And here's what I think is a cool idea.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   If you use that property with an eye towards the future, then you could buy one property
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and then it would just adjust and expand as needed.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So here's what I would consider.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Let's say I were single and I were young and I were very flexible.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I would buy a house that was the type of house and the type of neighborhood that I thought I might want to be when I were older.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But I would try to buy a house that had a main quarters and perhaps a house that also had a carriage house
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   or a mother-in-law quarters out back.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Then I would try to rent out the main house.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And then I would put the carriage house also up for rent.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And I would move, let's say, an older travel trailer into the yard.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   If the property were big enough, this could be done in an appropriate way.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Go ahead and plummet into the septic system so you had all your hookups ready to go.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And I would live in that travel trailer myself while I were young and flexible and I would keep the other units rented out.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Then let's say I moved on towards marriage.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And if my wife were enthusiastic about the idea of living in a travel trailer, great.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   But more likely, I would then move into the carriage house.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Be a little bit more comfortable, but I might rent out the travel trailer still or go ahead and sell it.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And then as our need for housing grew and expanded, then perhaps we'd go ahead and move into the big house and rent out the carriage house.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And then once we got to the point where we would enjoy having the space all of our own
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and our wealth had grown to the point where we were more interested in lifestyle than in maximum income,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   then we'd go ahead and cancel the renters in the carriage house and keep that available for our own guests or for use as an office or something like that.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Now this would be a very efficient way to own property and to make good use of property.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Because if I were 22 years old, I don't have need for a big giant house all myself.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   But as long as my income is sufficient to allow me to purchase it,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I could purchase it and let my tenants pay off the first several years of the mortgage
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   while I'm stacking aside money, building my investment portfolio.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And then I have the property established for my own future expansion plans.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And I could expand into the house as I got older.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And then in theory, very few of us would stay on the same property for this long.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But I could go ahead and downsize as time went on.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Kids grow up, move out of the house, or I could go ahead and move into the carriage house.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And I would love to be in a situation if I had adult children where I would move into the carriage house with my wife
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and we would have one of our children with grandchildren renting the main house.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That would be wonderful. And then perhaps change from there as circumstances warranted.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   This type of approach is very efficient. It's much more efficient than moving constantly.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Buying houses, selling houses, moving apartments is very expensive financially.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   There are the costs of moving. There are the costs of buying and selling.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   There are the costs of fixing up a place to be the way that you want it to be.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And many of the costs that you, the expenses that you incur in owning property will pay off well if you have time on your side.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   But if you're constantly moving and moving in and moving out, they don't pay off so well.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And so if you have a stable life, a stable income, a stable community,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   you could use a strategy like this to have a beautiful place that you've lived in for many years
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and it just gets better and better over time.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And there's no reason why some of the previously discussed strategies are exclusive.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   These strategies are not mutually exclusive. Rather, these are ideas that you could put together
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and you could work with multiple ideas.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So consider house hacking and look around in your situation and see if there's a way
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   in which the idea of house hacking could work in your life.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Final note, don't forget the idea of short-term rentals.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Obviously, short-term rentals, i.e. listing on sharing sites such as Airbnb, such as VRBO, etc.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Short-term rentals are really powerful and they can be used to your own benefit on many different houses.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And so you can rent them out seasonally. You want to go away for part of the season, come back for part of the season.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They can also be used flexibly.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I have a friend of mine right now who has exactly this type of situation.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   He has a large house. That house is very desirable on a sharing site.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   There is, in the back of the house, a mother-in-law quarters, and the house is perfectly appropriate for an RV
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   to be parked there and to be lived in.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And my friend is young and single, so it's relatively easy for him to be flexible.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Run the numbers. I think it's really compelling.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And I see no reason not to maximize that stream of income
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   if you're willing to be flexible in which bed you sleep in on a nightly basis.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Thank you for listening. You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics and techniques and tools
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   make a plan to take action on it.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So take action.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody that you care about.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   teaching others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and if you're gaining financial benefit from radical personal finance,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for this work voluntarily.
