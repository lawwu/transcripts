[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.140]   I couldn't get it out of my mind that a couple of weeks ago there was a survey of evangelicals,
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.680]   and it was called "The State of Theology."
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.520]   You can find it on the Ligonier website.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.400]   And people were basically defined as evangelicals if they believed the Bible, if they believed
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.620]   Jesus, and if they believed the gospel, and if they felt they were responsible to communicate
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.100]   the gospel to other people - those four things.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.160]   So if you were a Bible believer and a gospel believer in Christ, and you felt responsible
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.360]   to proclaim that, you were considered an evangelical.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.640]   Interestingly enough, the survey indicated that evangelicals have absolutely no idea
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.240]   what they believe, many of them.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.740]   And that's in contrast to Puritans and other responsible believers.
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:15.140]   For example, some of the questions were as follows: "Everyone is born innocent.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.060]   Agree or disagree?"
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.100]   Sixty-five percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.300]   Everyone is born innocent.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.860]   A second question: "The Bible is not literally true.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.860]   Agree or disagree?"
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860]   Fifty-five percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860]   The Bible is not literally true.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860]   Another one: "God accepts worship from all religions."
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860]   Fifty-six percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860]   And maybe the most telling: "Jesus was a good teacher, but not God."
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.860]   Forty-three percent of evangelicals agreed.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.860]   This is so dystopian.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:12.860]   This is so far from Puritan understanding or anybody who has a sound sense of
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.860]   doctrine.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.860]   This is so far from Puritan understanding or anybody who has a sound sense of
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.860]   doctrine.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.860]   This is so far from Puritan understanding or anybody who has a sound sense of doctrine.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860]   This is so far from Puritan understanding or anybody who has a sound sense of doctrine.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860]   That it's shocking.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.900]   How did we get "evangelicals" who don't believe what is necessary to be saved, let alone
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.560]   be a true evangelical?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.100]   How did we get here?
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.420]   Well, this is the legacy of leadership like people like priests, Hosea said.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.860]   People don't rise above their teachers, Jesus said.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.480]   And the evangelical church has been so busy over the last thirty years trying to find
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   ways not to offend non-Christians, trying to find ways to take the offenses out of the
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:12.860]   Christian message, designing approaches to non-believers that don't create hostility
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:25.900]   or rejection, that it has created an evangelical movement that is void of the truth.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.340]   Why do they do this?
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.620]   Because the gospel in truth is so offensive.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.480]   It is offensive.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.860]   In fact, strange as it may seem, the goodness of the gospel is so offensive, it is so offensive,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.860]   it is so offensive, it is so offensive.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:58.900]   And so I thought just to take advantage of the distinction between the Puritan understanding
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.200]   of sound doctrine and our understanding of sound doctrine, and what is pervasive around
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.340]   the evangelical movement, I'd go back to the beginning.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.380]   And talk about the most hated.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.500]   The most hated Christian doctrine.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.620]   And as I was walking through the halls of the office this morning, people were guessing
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.220]   what that might be.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.180]   You're about to find out.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:39.040]   Let's begin in John 15, John 15.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.900]   And there's a lot to be said about this.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:54.540]   And I am going to do the best I can to be selective and helpful to you in communicating.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.480]   And I think the right place to start is with what our Lord said about hate.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.300]   If we're talking about the hated Christian doctrine, the most hated doctrine, then we
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.420]   need to learn from Him.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   So John 15:18.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.240]   "Jesus is speaking in the upper room with His disciples, and He says, 'If the world
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.'
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.240]   One thing the disciples knew for sure was that the world hated Jesus Christ."
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.940]   That's right, they hated Him.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.680]   This is not the pagan world.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.000]   This is the world of Jewish religion.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.120]   This is the people who were, quote, unquote, "following the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.760]   Jacob," the God of the Old Testament, the Creator God.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.460]   And in fact, Jesus is God incarnate.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.640]   But they never recognized Him.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.360]   In fact, they fully rejected Him.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.700]   And He says here, "They hated Me."
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.180]   And He says, "They hated Me before they hated you."
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.040]   There was a time when the Jewish world didn't hate the apostles.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.980]   At the beginning of the ministry in John 7.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:45.080]   In verse 7, Jesus says, "The world cannot hate you."
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.700]   They see you as just part of their world.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.740]   They cannot hate you.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:00.820]   However, by the time you get to the seventeenth chapter of John, that changed.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:08.500]   And Jesus said this: "I have given you, disciples, My word.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   And the world has hated you."
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.400]   What changed?
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:23.920]   They didn't hate them until they had learned the message of Jesus and begun to preach it.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:32.160]   As long as Jesus was the one preaching the message, they hated Him.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.020]   As soon as the disciples began to do the same, they hated them.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.260]   But why all the hate?
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:49.880]   Why the hate of the most marvelous, compassionate, gentle, merciful, gracious, kind, loving human
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.180]   who ever walked on the earth?
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:08:02.020]   And more than that, the God-man who expressed divine love, offered forgiveness of sin, entrance
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.340]   into the kingdom of heaven, eternal life.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.540]   Why all the hate?
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:18.860]   And Jesus answered that in John 7, verse 7, "The world hates Me because I bear witness
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:29.460]   to it that its deeds are evil, that its deeds are evil."
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.100]   There is the most hated Christian doctrine.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.060]   It is the doctrine that theologians have called the Doctrine of the Law.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.860]   The doctrine of depravity.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.180]   The doctrine of total depravity, if you will.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:53.040]   The doctrine that declares that the whole human race is sinful.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:06.160]   That's what generates the hate, because fallen man has to find a way to tolerate himself,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.580]   and the dominant sin is to be hated.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:14.100]   The dominant sin in fallen man is pride, and he will create an image of himself which escapes
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.480]   ultimate condemnation.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:30.920]   He will spin a web of delusions about himself, that he is good, noble, anything but that
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.940]   his deeds are evil.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.100]   And this was especially compounded.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:44.060]   Jesus was saying that to the Jewish religious people.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:55.020]   You are evil not only in your general life, you are evil in your religion.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:02.660]   Your religion is just another form of your wickedness.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.620]   And John begins his gospel.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:17.480]   He says, "The world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.560]   They rejected him.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.600]   And from the get-go, there was hate.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.560]   As you go through John's gospel, you see this hate play out in the whole record of our Lord's
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.560]   life.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.140]   In chapter 5 and verse 16, it says, "The Jews were persecuting Jesus.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.140]   They were not afraid of Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath."
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.880]   He was violating their religion.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.540]   In verse 18, he says, "The Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him."
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:11:02.180]   It's only in the fifth chapter of John that they want Him dead.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.900]   They wanted to kill Him.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   Why?
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.640]   Because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but was calling God his own Father, making
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.620]   himself equal with God.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.160]   In the seventh chapter, it says, "The Jews were seeking to kill Him again."
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.180]   And in verse 32, the officers of the Pharisees were trying to seize Him, arrest Him.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.260]   In chapter 8 and chapter 10, they pick up stones to stone Him to death.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.420]   In chapter 11, they plot to kill Him, eventually arrest Him, beat Him, scourge Him.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.420]   In chapter 12, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.420]   In chapter 13, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.420]   In chapter 14, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   In chapter 15, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   In chapter 16, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   In chapter 17, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   In chapter 18, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   In chapter 19, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.420]   In chapter 20, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   In chapter 21, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   In chapter 22, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.420]   In chapter 23, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.420]   In chapter 24, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.420]   In chapter 25, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.420]   In chapter 26, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.420]   In chapter 27, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   In chapter 28, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420]   In chapter 29, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.420]   In chapter 30, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   In chapter 31, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   In chapter 32, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   In chapter 33, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   In chapter 34, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   In chapter 35, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.420]   In chapter 36, they plot to kill Him.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.420]   In chapter 37, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   In chapter 38, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420]   In chapter 39, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   In chapter 40, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420]   In chapter 40, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.420]   In chapter 41, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   In chapter 42, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.420]   In chapter 43, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.420]   In chapter 44, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   In chapter 45, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.420]   In chapter 45, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   In chapter 45, they plot to kill Him.

[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.

[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.

[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   In chapter 46, they plot to kill Him.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:12.820]   In verse 51, He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word, he will
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.540]   never see death.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.440]   I'm offering you eternal life."
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.980]   And the Jews said to Him, "Now we know that you have a demon."
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:29.260]   Now, I don't know what evangelistic strategy you think you can use to overcome natural
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.580]   human, sinful resistance.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.380]   But if you think you can, you can.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.500]   Develop any strategy to do that, you're a fool.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.720]   Jesus had no strategy that bypassed the reality.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:20:04.340]   This is the human condition: sinful, blind, dead, ignorant, darkened, under satanic power.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:13.060]   Speaking the truth doesn't change anything.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:21.480]   Because you speak the truth, they don't believe because it's so alien to their nature.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:29.140]   And you can't be more hostile than to say to someone, "You're from hell."
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.300]   But that's what the religious Jews said to Jesus.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   They said, "You're from hell."
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.800]   That's why they've martyred the apostles.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.140]   They hate the truth.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:13.220]   So when you talk to somebody about the gospel, there may be a natural tendency to avoid talking
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:19.080]   about the true condition of a non-believer.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.860]   You have to have some courage to do that.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.260]   You have to be willing to take the heart.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.260]   You have to be willing to take the heart.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.260]   You have to be willing to take the heart.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260]   You have to be willing to take the heart.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:33.640]   And when they reject with hostility, you say, "That's exactly what I would expect."
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:41.420]   That's the evidence of the depth of your sin that you will not believe because you cannot
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.860]   believe.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:54.220]   Back in John 5, verse 39, Jesus says to these same Jewish leaders, "You search the Scripture."
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:01.720]   You actually have the Old Testament, because you think that in the Scriptures you have
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.220]   eternal life.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.840]   "It is these that testify about Me.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.120]   I am the subject of the Scriptures."
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   Jesus points that out in Luke 24 when He tells the disciples that He went back into the Old
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.220]   Testament, the Law, the prophets, and the writings, and spoke to them of everything
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.180]   concerning Himself.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.180]   "They're about Me.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.180]   They're about Me.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.160]   They're about Me."
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:33.680]   Verse 40, "And you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life."
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:44.600]   The offer of life, the true offer, the true gospel will offend.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   It will generate hostility and hatred.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.140]   And because it's the truth, they can't accept it.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.900]   Because they are under such pervasive deception.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:05.280]   And verse 40 sums it up as saying, "You are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   life.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.680]   I can offer you that life.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.540]   I do offer you that life.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:15.400]   You have no capacity to come and receive it."
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.220]   Now over to John 6, verse 44.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.120]   "And you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   I can offer you that life.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   I do offer you that life.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   You have no capacity to come and receive it."
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.100]   Now over to John 6, verse 44.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   "And you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.180]   I do offer you that life.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:35.200]   No one can come to Me, no one, unless the Father who sent Me draws him."
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.640]   You don't have a capacity to come.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.440]   You are so profoundly captive to sin.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:49.560]   You are under the deceptive leadership of Satan.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.060]   You have a natural aversion to the truth.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.260]   You have a natural aversion to the truth about your own wretchedness.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:04.020]   You are unwilling to come, and you are unable to come.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:12.280]   So if I were to define total depravity in a simple way, it is simply this: that people
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.880]   on their own are unwilling and unable to come to Christ.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.720]   And I would go a step further and say, "That is true.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:33.460]   But what is also true is that they are hostile to His message."
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:45.080]   That's why it's so hard to enter the kingdom, because it requires a reassessment of yourself
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:52.800]   that a self-protective sinner has no capacity to accomplish.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:25:02.760]   So the most hated doctrine is that everyone is a sinner, and seriously so, and profoundly
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:11.780]   so, so that it incapacitates, so that it's impossible to believe the truth, so that the
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:22.760]   truth sounds like a lie, so that Jesus sounds like a demon-possessed person.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:34.520]   This most hated doctrine then has to be followed with the fact that sin brings judgment.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.880]   So this is your condition.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:44.180]   You are a sinner, and you are headed for eternal judgment in hell.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:52.720]   That is so offensive, so unacceptable, so unbelievable.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.100]   It's the most hated doctrine.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:10.920]   So evangelicalism in its current form decides to bypass that and say, "Jesus wants you happy.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.840]   He wants you successful.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.720]   He wants you to work up a list that you'd like Him to give you, and you can speak it
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.760]   into existence.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.680]   And whatever your carnal desires are, you can do it.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   You can do it.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   You can do it.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   You can do it."
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.820]   Jesus is here to satisfy your carnal desires.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.620]   You don't have to recognize that you're a sinner.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.120]   In fact, you're born innocent.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.840]   You don't have to believe that He's the Son of God.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:45.960]   You don't even have to follow the Christian religion, because God accepts all religions.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.640]   If I say to people, "Jesus will give you eternal life.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.900]   God accepts any religion," that's not offensive.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.660]   If I say, "Well, the Bible is a wonderful book, and it has a lot of truth, but of course,
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.220]   it's not all true.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:13.720]   Some of it's myth," that's not offensive, because you can pick the parts that you want
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.040]   to be myth and eliminate them.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.940]   But when you say, "This is the truth.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.600]   This is all the truth.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:30.880]   And the truth is that you are a sinner, dead in trespasses and sins, as we will see.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:41.760]   And your default position is to believe lies to such a degree that the truth seems demonic.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.600]   That's how profoundly evil you are.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.020]   And you are headed for eternal judgment.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.560]   You have just destroyed God.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:28:03.500]   You have destroyed the sinner's house of cards that He has built for self-protection.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.880]   So this is the most hated doctrine.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.800]   But at the same time, it is the most distinctively Christian doctrine.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.420]   It is the most distinctively Christian doctrine.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.180]   What do I mean by that?
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:22.520]   I mean this: no other religion has this doctrine.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.980]   Did you hear that?
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:34.620]   No other religion has this doctrine, because all other religions are some form of works
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:46.580]   salvation, some good in me that can achieve salvation, can gain favor with the deity,
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:52.480]   or can cooperate with God.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:29:02.960]   All religion, even all false forms of Christianity, affirm that people are good or have enough
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:13.180]   good in them, a provenient kind of grace that allows them to contribute to their salvation.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.340]   They can choose to believe.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.220]   They can choose to be saved.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.440]   They can choose to accept Christ.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:33.160]   They can bring some of their religiosity, some of their morality, some of their human
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:40.620]   goodness as part of the payment for salvation.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.400]   Every religion is that way.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   Only Christianity says, "You bring nothing."
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.120]   Salvation is not by works, lest any man should boast.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.860]   It is by grace.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:08.300]   Only Christianity teaches that.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:16.440]   And in order to be a Christian, you have to understand that the salvation that you receive
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:22.360]   is all of grace, because if you add works, then grace is no more grace.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.860]   So the doctrine of human depravity is the most hated doctrine.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.760]   It is the most distinctively Christian doctrine.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.220]   Only Christian truth teaches that.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.180]   It is also the most contrary Christian doctrine.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.300]   It is rejected - and this goes back to what I read earlier.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:52.320]   It is the most rejected doctrine, because human fallenness is a condition of deception.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.820]   It is a condition of darkness, of deadness.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.540]   And reason can never escape the fall.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.460]   The universal condition of all men is they are all deceived.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   The God of this world, 2 Corinthians 4:4, has blinded the minds of the unbelieving,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:22.280]   lest the glorious gospel of Christ.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.620]   "The gospel of Christ should come to them."
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:40.120]   So everybody is naturally evil, essentially evil in nature, incurably evil, to the degree
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:48.380]   that they are unwilling and unable to hear the truth, believe the truth, or come to Christ.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.240]   In fact, they are hostile.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.

[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   They are not willing to hear the truth.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:40:01.600]   Jeremiah says, "The heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked."
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:16.020]   In Romans 8, a couple of verses, Romans 8 and verse 6, 7, and 8, diagnosis from Paul:
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.280]   the mind set on the flesh is death.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   Verse 7.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.840]   The mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.280]   It does not subject itself to the law of God.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.780]   It is not even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.880]   That is that unwilling and unable again.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.960]   You're in the flesh.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   You're of the flesh.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   You do the deeds of the flesh, driven by the lusts of the flesh, and the flesh is hostile
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   toward God.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.600]   It can't subject itself to the law of God.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:02.200]   It's not even possible.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   So this is the sinner's condition.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:13.880]   You're so sinful, you're unwilling and unable to believe the truth.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.360]   And because you have no capacity for that, you hate it.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.540]   You hate it.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.500]   And this is deep.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:37.140]   The conduct of such a person is described in the seventh chapter of Mark.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:43.740]   Listen to this, verse 20, our Lord speaking: "That which proceeds out of the man, that
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.280]   is what defiles the man."
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.480]   Common psychology today is that man is a man.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   He's a man.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.240]   He's a man.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   The man of today would say, "I'm a good person, but people hurt me.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.080]   People do harm to me.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.460]   What may be wrong with me is because of somebody's action against me."
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.820]   Jesus would say, "No, that's not the issue.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.680]   That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.380]   What's wrong with you is inside.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:19.120]   For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.360]   murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.200]   envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:35.060]   All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man."
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:39.000]   We're not talking about some mass murderer here.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.620]   We're not talking about Adolf Hitler.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.460]   We're not talking about Jeffrey Dahmers.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.000]   This is everybody.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.360]   Everybody.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:04.180]   In Romans, chapter 3, Paul sums it up using Scripture from the Old Testament, verse 10:
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.980]   "There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.720]   There is none who understands.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.040]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.760]   All have turned aside; together they have become useless.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.880]   There is none who does good.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.820]   There is not even one.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.480]   Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they keep deceiving.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.980]   The poison of asps is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.600]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.620]   Destruction and misery are in their paths, and the path of peace they have not known.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.380]   There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.760]   That is a diagnosis of every person.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:44:03.940]   Some is that we are evil and selfish, unwilling, unable, dead, dark, ignorant, with no capacity
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.460]   to do anything to change that.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.320]   That's what you have to say to the sinner.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.760]   "Yeah, this is who you are, and you can't do anything about it.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.640]   You can't do anything."
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.400]   You can't do anything about it.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:30.120]   Well, how do I get straightened out?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.760]   There is one who can do something about it.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   Let's go back to John, chapter 1, for a minute as we kind of wrap up.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.520]   And listen to this.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.580]   Verse 12, John 1.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.580]   This is right at the outset of the gospel of John, which was written that you might
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:45:00.040]   believe that Jesus is the Christ, and believing, have life in His name, as it says at the end.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:17.360]   even to those who believe in His name; as many as received Him, He gave the right to
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.400]   become the children of God.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.880]   Even to those who believe in His name."
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.360]   And then this: "Who were born?"
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.160]   Oh, you have to be reborn.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.640]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.980]   You have to be.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.480]   You can't fix what you are.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.680]   You have to be reborn.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:41.400]   And that happens, not of blood - you don't inherit it - nor of the will of the flesh
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:48.280]   - you don't will it - nor of the will of man, nor does somebody else will it for you.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:52.960]   But it's of God.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:46:03.840]   If you are born again, it is the work of God, totally the work of God.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   Look over to chapter 3 of John, verse 5.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.360]   Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.160]   he can't enter the kingdom."
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.940]   Now remember, Nicodemus was wondering, "How do I get in the kingdom?"
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:28.440]   And in verse 3, Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.640]   cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:35.680]   Just exactly the same analogy as in John 1.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.400]   And so Nicodemus says, "Well, I can't be born."
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.480]   He knew, he understood the analogy.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   Jesus was saying, "You need to be born again," and Nicodemus immediately knew by the analogy
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.220]   that Jesus was telling him something that he couldn't do.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:56.540]   Simply, folks, what contribution did you make to your birth?
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.540]   It's absurd.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.980]   Of course you made none.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.560]   That is exactly the same contribution you make to your new birth.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.960]   You make none.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.740]   You bring nothing.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.920]   You must be born.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.200]   That which is born of the flesh, in verse 6, is flesh.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.700]   That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.740]   So if you're going to be born again spiritually, that's not something you can do.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:35.260]   That is something the Spirit must do.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:40.020]   In fact, in verse 7 he says, "So don't be amazed," I said to you, "you must be born
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.020]   again."
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.600]   Or , "you must be born from above."
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.800]   The Spirit has to give you birth.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Well, how does that happen?
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.560]   In verse 8, "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it and don't know
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.040]   where it comes from or where it's going, so is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.480]   Again, you have no role in that.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.180]   You play no part in that.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.820]   You contribute nothing.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.680]   How could you when you are unwilling, unable, and totally deceived, and because somebody
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.880]   speaks the truth, you hate it?
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.680]   This is some heavenly work.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:25.140]   That has to be done by the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.880]   Turn over to John 6, verse 44.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:39.320]   "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him."
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:47.560]   You're not going to come unless the Father draws you and the Spirit gives you life.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.560]   You're not going to go unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   You're not going to go unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   You're going to come unless the Father draws you.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:32.060]   But the sinner, in order to do that, must have come to the true recognition of who he
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:37.440]   is by the prompting of the Holy Spirit, who has convicted him of sin and righteousness
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.640]   and judgment, as John 16 says.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:50.480]   He must have come to the end of himself and all self-confidence so that he denies himself,
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.560]   and he must cry out.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:51:03.320]   Cry out for salvation that is a gift of grace.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:13.100]   Unless and until God moves, nothing changes.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:23.560]   One final text in 1 Corinthians 1.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.740]   Verse 26, "Consider your calling, brethren."
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:33.760]   This is your heavenly calling, the effectual calling to salvation.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:39.780]   There were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:47.180]   When the Lord started calling people, obviously, He didn't choose the wise and the mighty and
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.180]   the noble.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:53.560]   Verse 27 says, "God has chosen the foolish of the world to shame the wise."
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:59.080]   God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.940]   And the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:10.060]   Do you notice three times God has chosen, God has chosen, God has chosen?
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.380]   Why?
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:18.280]   Verse 29, "So that no one may boast before God."
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.560]   So if you're a believer, you brought nothing to it.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:31.620]   You can't boast in your wisdom, your virtue, your spirituality.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.280]   You can only boast before God.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:40.440]   And then he concludes that chapter with these marvelous words, "By His doing, by God's doing,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.240]   you are in Christ Jesus."
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.460]   You didn't get here by your own will.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:53.560]   Depravity forbade that.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:53:00.160]   By His doing, you're in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God and righteousness
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.440]   and sanctification and redemption.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:14.800]   So that, just as it is written back in Jeremiah, "Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord."
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.480]   So what does this do?
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.560]   What is this culmination?
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   It's a revelation.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   It's a revelation.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   It's a revelation.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.680]   "By His doing, by God's doing, He draws whom He chooses, the Spirit gives life, the Son
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.640]   sets free.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:39.440]   And we have contributed nothing to it, so that we forever and ever and ever and ever
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.560]   give Him all the glory."
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   The only thing a sinner can do is cry out.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   Like the man in Luke, "God, be merciful to me," what?
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.320]   A sinner.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:17.640]   As long as people try to hide the doctrine of depravity, as long as people try to take
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:23.560]   the offenses out of the gospel.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:33.720]   They will disillusion people in the most severe way, who think they're evangelicals
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:40.640]   when they couldn't possibly be Christians at all.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:49.060]   We have to be honest enough to give the hated bad news in order to deliver to the sinner
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.560]   the good news that, "Oh, by the way, though you can do nothing good, you can do nothing
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.720]   about it.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:05.800]   Christ will accept you by grace."
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   That's the message of the gospel.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:23.560]   Let's pray.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:35.360]   reminded, our Father, of the consistency of Your Word, its power, its clarity. And I just
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:43.640]   pray today that in the clarity of this all of us who are true believers might have a
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:51.440]   fresh and new commitment to be honest with the truth of the gospel, honest with the bad
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.460]   news, honest with the good news.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:07.680]   And the good news is so good, as impossible as salvation is, as profoundly sinful as we
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:21.420]   are, as unwilling and unable as we are, as resistant as we are to the truth, as blasphemous
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:34.360]   as we can become, even fabricating a God who doesn't exist and thereby breaking the commandments.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:43.380]   You are willing to forgive, and you will forgive the sinner who cries out to you. Jesus said
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:51.400]   in John 6 as well, "Whoever comes to Me, I will forgive him who comes to Me." And I
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.580]   and no wise cast out.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:07.640]   So, Lord, may sinners who see perhaps their own condition clearly this day do the only
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:17.140]   thing a sinner can do, plead, "Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.860]   Believe me.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:29.240]   Give us the boldness to proclaim the truth that must be claimed, owned, believed, so
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:40.920]   that the sinner, broken, penitent, and helpless, falls before the holy judge and pleads for
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:45.180]   grace and mercy through Jesus Christ."
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.180]   Amen.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:46.180]   Amen.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:51.180]   He is us in that way, we pray for Your glory.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:51.960]   Amen.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   Amen.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   Amen.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   Amen.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   Amen.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Amen.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Amen.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   Amen.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   Amen.
