[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.620]   Love speech is much more important than love speech.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.240]   And the reason is, I'm much more interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.700]   than I am interested in figuring out who loves me.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.560]   The following is a conversation with Harvey Silverglade,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.900]   a legendary free speech advocate, co-founder of FIRE,
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.300]   the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression,
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.940]   and the author of several books on the freedom of speech and criminal justice,
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.420]   including The Shadow University,
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.780]   and The Shadow University.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.780]   The Shadow University is a free speech advocacy organization that is a part of the Shadow University.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.780]   The Shadow University is a free speech advocacy organization that is a part of the Shadow University.

[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   It's by having such difficult conversations, not by avoiding them, that we can begin to heal divides and shed light on the dark parts of human history and human nature.

[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   It's a very difficult period right now, both on campus and off campus.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   It's about as intolerant an era as I can remember.

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.780]   I was born during the McCarthy era.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.820]   So that says a lot.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.840]   It sort of reminds me of that.

[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:26.040]   things that are going to make somebody feel bad.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.520]   Um, the purpose of speech is to express honest views that people have.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.020]   And, um, so I believe hate speech is as important as love speech.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.020]   And my view is that hate speech is as important as love speech.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.020]   And my view is that hate speech is as important as love speech.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.020]   And my view is that hate speech is as important as love speech.

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.440]   entend and is however
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.760]  werth of speech eventually leads to a censorship of thought.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.920]   Of course, censorship of the mode by which other people know what you're thinking.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.120]   So there's some aspect of our society that is that thinking is done collectively.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.000]   And without being able to speak to each other, we cannot do this kind of collective thinking.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.920]   And out of the theory is that ultimately out of speech comes truth.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.880]   That isn't necessarily so.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.300]   But I do think that when there's free speech,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   better decisions are made.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   But I do think that when there's free speech,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   better decisions are made.

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.500]   better decisions are made.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.540]   better decisions are made.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.540]   better decisions are made. Because people put their views on the table in a frank, accurate way.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.640]   And then those views mix together and clash.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   And out of that usually comes the better decision.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.800]   And out of that usually comes the better decision.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.860]   And out of that usually comes the better decision.

[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.860]   not always but usually or more often they're not.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.860]   not always but if somebody is not allowed to be a citizen.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.860]   or decision-of decision-making.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.300]   decision-making.

[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:15.380]   decision-making. Then the decision-making process is poorer, less robust, less diverse, and ultimately less successful.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.580]   Then the decision-making process is poorer, less robust, less diverse, and ultimately less successful.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.280]   Then the decision-making process is poorer, less robust, less diverse, and ultimately less successful. Can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.420]   Can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism?
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:27.100]   So hate speech can be quite painful to quite a large number of people.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.160]   So hate speech can be quite painful to quite a large number of people.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.460]   So hate speech can be quite painful to quite a large number of people. Does this worry you?
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.560]   Does this worry you?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   Does this worry you? Yep. Living in a free society requires that you expose yourself to the fact that you're not a free person.

[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.420]   And I'll also ask about your review of his most recent books.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.780]   But before then it'd be interesting, um,
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:22.120]   to ask what you think of him as a human being as a, as a lawyer. He's a,
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.080]   quite an interesting case.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.540]   He's represented some of the most controversial figures in history,
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.880]   including Jeffrey Epstein, including Jeffrey Epstein, Mike Tyson,
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.500]   Julian Assange, Jim Baker, and, uh,
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:33.780]  èƒŽ,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   There's a lot of people who think of him as a lawyer,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   and, uh,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   There's a lot of people who think of him as a lawyer,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   And, uh,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   There's a lot of people who think of him as a lawyer,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   And, uh,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   There's a lot of people who think of him as a lawyer,
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:43.460]   showed
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.300]   I'm sorry. I didn't represent Trump because he agrees with him politically. He voted for Hillary I believe you're all. He voted for Hillary. Yes. That's what he says and I absolutely believe it. He's a liberal Democrat. But he's a criminal defense lawyer as well as a professor. And I've represented some very nasty people in my career. I wouldn't go out for coffee with them. But they have the constitutional rights to representation.

[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:52.560]   because it's not abolished.

[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   - But to show that an innocent man is guilty is also solving the case from their perspective.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:51.640]   So to falsely convict or falsely impress the person who is guilty is also solving the case from their perspective.

[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   Well, it closes the case if they falsely imprison an innocent man. There are issues in closing cases.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   So that's the FBI but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this. What are your views on the right that an American citizen has to privacy?
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   Well, wiretapping and electronic surveillance are very, very intrusive.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   Well, wiretapping and electronic surveillance are very, very intrusive.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   And there are some things that are very, very, very intrusive.

[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   And the fact that are, there are some things that are very, very intrusive.

[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:29.720]   And I think that the circumference that these tools are used should be narrowed.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   For example, they're used in a lot of drug cases.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   For example, they're used in a lot of drug cases. Since I don't think drugs should be illegal in any event.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   Since I don't think drugs should be illegal in any event. I certainly think that it's a terrible violation of privacy to use wiretapping in a drug case.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   I certainly think that it's a terrible violation of privacy to use wiretapping in a drug case. I could see it in cases of murder.

[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000]   Long story why we had to move from Brooklyn had to do with my father's having a problem with the furries union and having his life threatened.

[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   And the idea was that she and I were going to marry.
