[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   It is the most important right that Americans have.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:11.800]   It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.080]   Without it, no democratic society can be democratic for long.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.960]   And I'm an absolutist.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.060]   That is, I believe that, for example, people say to me, but what about hate speech?
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.600]   Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:40.660]   And the reason is I'm much more interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on than I am interested in figuring out who loves me.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:57.700]   The following is a conversation with Harvey Silverglate, a legendary free speech advocate, co-founder of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, and the author of several books on the freedom of speech and criminal justice, including The Shadow Universe.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.140]   The betrayal of liberty on America's campuses.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.640]   Harvey is running to be on the Harvard Board of Overseers this year with a write-in campaign.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.120]   So you have to spell his name correctly.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.200]   Silverglate.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.820]   Promising to advocate for free speech and to push for reducing the size of Harvard's administration bureaucracy.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.020]   Election is over this Tuesday, May 16th at 5 p.m. Eastern.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.980]   To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.560]   So if you happen to be one.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.020]   Please vote online.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.360]   It's a good way to support freedom of speech on Harvard campus.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.740]   Instructions how to do so are in the description.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:49.440]   As a side note, please allow me to say that since there are several controversial conversations coming up, I tried to make sure that this podcast is a platform for free discourse where ideas are not censored but explored.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.900]   And if necessary, challenged in a thoughtful and pathetic way.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.400]   It's by having such difficult conversations.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Not by avoiding.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.420]   That we can begin to heal divides and to shed light on the dark parts of human history and human nature.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.100]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.500]   And now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.040]   You co-founded the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as FIRE.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.380]   A legendary organization that fights for the freedom of speech for all Americans in our courtrooms, on our campuses.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.160]   And in our culture.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   So let's start with a big question.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.920]   What is freedom of speech?
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:44.700]   First of all, the organization, when I co-founded it in 1999, was called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.900]   It focused on free speech issues on college campuses in academia.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.300]   And only earlier this year did we decide to expand our region.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.

[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   And we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   - So you don't think that hate speech
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   can empower large groups
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   that eventually lead to physical action,
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   that eventually lead to physical action,
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   that eventually lead to physical action,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   to physical harm to others?
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.300]   - No, I don't.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   I think that we have developed a culture
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   in which it's understood that if you don't like
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   in which it's understood that if you don't like
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   what you hear, you talk back.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   You write something.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   You write something.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.300]   We don't punch each other.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.300]   We insult each other.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   It's insulting, great.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   Well, I don't know, it's okay.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   I used to, as a kid in Brooklyn,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   I used to, as a kid in Brooklyn,
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   we used to say, "Sticks and stones can break my bones,
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   but names can never harm me."
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.300]   And it's absolutely true.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.300]   What was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.300]   what was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.300]   So I've lived a long time.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.300]   I've seen it all.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   And I'm talking from experience as well as theory.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   It's what happens when you get in a fight
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   and you reach your 80s.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   I read that you had this line
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   that you cannot be protected
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   from being called an asshole.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   Correct. Especially if you're an asshole.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.300]   Well, that's...
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   But you don't have to be an asshole
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.300]   to be called an asshole.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   That's correct.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   And I think the internet has taught me that.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   Well, the internet has posed a particular challenge
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   to free speech absolutists
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   because some of the stuff that's on there
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   is god-awful.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.300]   But I have no different rules
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   for freedom of speech on the internet
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   than I have in newspapers
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.300]   or in lectures
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   or in classrooms
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   or conversations among people.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   What do you think about the
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   tension between freedom of speech
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   and freedom of reach
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.300]   as it's sometimes termed?
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   So the internet really challenges that aspect.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.300]   It allows speech to become viral
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   and spread
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   very quickly to a very large number of people.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   Well, you know, we've had
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.300]   revolutions in
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   the modalities
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.300]   of communication.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   After all,
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.300]   newspapers were the first challenge.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   Radio and television
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.300]   posed
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.300]   a new challenge.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   The FCC
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.300]   tried,
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.300]   but ultimately gave up the attempt to
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   control
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   obscenity,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.300]   for example.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   And the Supreme Court
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   has been pretty close.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.300]   The one thing that liberal
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.300]   and conservative Supreme Courts,
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   right now we're in a conservative era
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   due to Trump nominations.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   During much of my life
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   the Warren Court,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   it was William O. Douglas,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   Brennan,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300]   the liberal court,
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.300]   one thing they agree on
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.300]   is free speech. They don't agree on much else.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   But they do agree on
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.300]   free speech, and I think the reason
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   is that they
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   recognize that, well,
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   my group is in the
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   ascendance today, but it may not be tomorrow,
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   and I want to have objective,
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   clear rules
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300]   so that when I'm in the minority
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   I'm able to voice my opinion.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.300]   And so,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.300]   it's one of the few things that
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   both sides of the political spectrum
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.300]   agree on. The only people
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.300]   who don't are the people
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   way over on the right that I call the
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.300]   fascists and the people way over on the left
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   who are the communists.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   But with respect
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   to most people in this,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.300]   on the political spectrum,
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   Republicans, Democrats, Socialists,
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.300]   Libertarians,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.300]   they agree on the primacy
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.300]   of free speech because it protects them
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.300]   when protection
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.300]   is needed. So to you,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   even on the internet,
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   free speech absolutism
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   should rule? Yes.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   Nobody's gonna die.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.300]   Remember, death threats are not
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.300]   protected.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.300]   Nobody's gonna die.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   So people are gonna be a little
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   bit insulted. That's the price you pay for
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.300]   living in a free society.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   And it's a small price
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.300]   in my view.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.300]   Some people don't have as tough a hide
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.300]   as others. Well, then develop it.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   I don't mean to sound
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   cruel, but
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   you're living in a free society.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.300]   Develop a tough hide.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.300]   So that's the cost
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.300]   of living in a free society. Yep.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.300]   There's a cost. The thing is
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   that it can really hurt at scale
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   to be cyber-bullied,
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   to be attacked for the ideas you express
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   or maybe ideas you didn't express
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   but that somebody
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   decided to lie about you
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   and use that to
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   attack you. Well, first of all,
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.300]   there are
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   some exceptions to the First Amendment.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   Libel and slander
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   is an exception.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.300]   Direct threats
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   are an exception.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   If you say
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.300]   such and such, I will murder you.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   That is not lawful.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.300]   If you say
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   about somebody,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   "Oh, you know,
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   you beat your wife,"
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   that is not lawful
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   if in fact the person knows you don't beat your wife.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   There are some limits.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.300]   Defamation is one.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   Direct threats are another.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   And
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300]   so it's not absolute.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   The First Amendment is not absolute.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   But it's
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.300]   more absolute than it is in any other society
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   and it's pretty near absolute.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   For example,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   fraud. If you
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   sell somebody a car
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   and you say, "Oh, this is in great running shape
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   and in fact it's an old jalopy and it's
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   not going to make it more than 10 miles,"
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.300]   that's fraud. That's not
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   free speech.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   So free speech is not
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300]   absolute. There are these limits.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   But they're very narrow, specific
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   categories of limits.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   But there's gray area here because
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   while legally you're not allowed
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   to defame a person,
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   in the court of public opinion,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   especially with the aid of anonymity
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   on the internet, rumors
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.300]   can spread at scale.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.300]   Thousands, hundreds of
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.300]   thousands of people can make up things
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   about you. You have to
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   defend yourself. Using more
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.300]   speech. We're big, we're through freedom
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   of speech. We're big boys and girls.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.300]   You have to defend
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   yourself.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.300]   You know, in some societies
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   if you say something,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   if you, right now, if you say
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.300]   something nasty about Putin, you'll end up
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   in the gulag.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   If you say something nasty about
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.300]   Biden, you end up in the
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   New York Times. Where would you rather be?
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   Well, let's talk about
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.300]   the thing you've done for over 20
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   years, which is
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.300]   fight for the freedom of speech on college campuses.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   So why is
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.300]   freedom of speech important on college campuses?
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   Well, it's important everywhere
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   in the society, but it's most important
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   on college campuses. Why?
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   Because that's where we educate
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.300]   our young citizens.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   And if you are educated
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.300]   under
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   a notion that some dean
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   can call
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   you on the carpet,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   because you say something
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   which is considered racist, or you can
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   say something which is
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   considered dangerous
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   to
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   social cohesion,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   then
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   it's not a liberal arts college.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.300]   Now, the
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   theory that
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   I used in the Shadow University
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.300]   A book you've written,
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   The Shadow University.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   1998.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   You were ahead of a lot of these things, by the way.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   I'm afraid that as
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   a pessimist, I always
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.300]   saw the bad side of things.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   The portrayal of liberty on America's campuses,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   the Shadow University,
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   a book you co-authored with Alan Charles.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   Yes, with one of my Princeton classmates,
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   Alan Charles Kors, who's
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.300]   now an emeritus professor of
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   Enlightenment history at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   I only taught
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   for one semester, and I can go into
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.300]   that later, the other reason that I did not
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   continue to teach in
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   colleges.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   It was Harvard Law School. I taught
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   a course in the mid-1980s.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   But in any event,
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   the college campuses
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   are one of the most important
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   for free speech.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   This is where people get
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.300]   education. And if
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   you don't really get a good education,
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.300]   if certain points of view are
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.300]   not allowed to be expressed, because education
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.300]   comes from the clash of
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   ideas, and you then
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   have to decide, this is
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   how you become a thinking adult.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   You have to decide
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   which ideas make more sense to you,
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   which ones you're going to follow,
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   the college
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.300]   experience is transformative.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   And
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.300]   if there is censorship on campuses,
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   it's highly destructive
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.300]   of the educational
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   enterprise, and
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   ultimately to the entire society.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.300]   You know, we have
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   in the sciences,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   we have
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   a scientific method.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.300]   Scientific method is, you try
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   experiments, and you see
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   which ones work, and then you
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.300]   develop theories based upon the results
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   of experiments. Well, this is
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.300]   not much different from every other aspect of
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   life. You have to entertain
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.300]   different views on different subjects.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   You hear all the views, and you
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   make a decision as to which one's accurate
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.300]   and which one's not. So
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   the scientific method I apply to
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   non-science,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   to history,
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   to journalism,
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   to all of these things.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.300]   So that scientific method includes
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   ideas, hateful ideas, all
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.300]   sorts of things. Correct. If you don't allow hateful ideas,
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   I mean, when
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   scientists do experiments,
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   nobody says to them, "Oh, you know,
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.300]   don't do that experiment,
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   because it would be very bad if that
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   turns out to be accurate, that
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   outcome." That's not the way it works.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   Every point of view
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.300]   is thrown into the
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   marketplace, whether it's science or whether
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   it's
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   non-science.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   And that includes
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   the kind of ideas and the kind of discourse that
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   might actually lead to an increase
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   in hate on campuses.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.300]   The First Amendment
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   prohibits
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   speech which is liable to produce
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.300]   imminent
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   imminent violence.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   So, for example,
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.300]   you know,
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   the exception is
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   yelling falsely,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   falsely yelling fire in a crowded
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.300]   movie theater. A lot of people
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   misstate it. They say, "Oh,
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   the exception is yelling fire
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   in a movie theater." Well, if there's really a fire,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   you're performing a real important
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   function by yelling fire.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.300]   But it's falsely yelling fire.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   You could start a riot, people would be
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.300]   crushed trying to get out.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   So there are these, that's
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   one of the exceptions of
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   the First Amendment as the Supreme Court has
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   defined it.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.300]   There are very few exceptions.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   And
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   defamation is an exception.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   I'm not a fan of that
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   exception, frankly.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   But if you say something
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.300]   about somebody that
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   has serious implications
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   in their life,
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   in their ability to earn a living,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   if you say, accuse somebody of
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   being a pedophile when it's not true,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   that person can
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   sue you.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   My own view is I think that's an unfortunate
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   exception, but I'm not on the
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   Supreme Court.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   I think that
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   I'm with,
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   a friend of mine was
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   Nat Hentoff. Nat Hentoff
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   who wrote for decades for the
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.300]   Village Voice in New York.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   He was
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   a friend of mine. He was a free speech
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   absolutist.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   And he wrote a fabulous book
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   called Free Speech for Me, But Not
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.300]   for Thee.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   And he was an absolutist
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   and I'm with Nat Hentoff.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.300]   Even on the defamation aspect.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.300]   I mean, I agree with you in some sense.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   Just practically speaking,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   it seems like
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   that the way,
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   the best way in the public
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   sphere to defend against defamation is
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   with more speech.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   Correct. And through authenticity,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   through authentic
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.300]   communication
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   of the truth as you see it.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.300]   Yeah. You know, at times
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.300]   the Boston Globe has said something about me
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.300]   that hasn't been accurate. They have
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   invariably published my letter to
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   the editor. I'm also
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   not bashful
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   about getting in touch with the
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   reporter. At the end of every column they
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.300]   give the reporter's email address.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   And
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.300]   I know people say that I
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   have more access to
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   the media than most people.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   But
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   all that means is I get the fame more than
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   most people. Can we also
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   comment on, from the individual
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   consumer of speech,
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   there's a kind
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   of sense that
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.300]   freedom of speech means
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   you should be forced to read all of it.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   Freedom of speech versus
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   freedom of reach. We as
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   consumers of speech, do we
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.300]   have the right to select what we read?
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.300]   We do. And
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   nobody can force us to sit
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   in a room and listen to a radio program
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.300]   that we don't want to listen to. Nobody
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   can force us to read a book that we don't
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   want to read.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.300]   The whole notion of freedom of
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.300]   speech means that people
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   have autonomy.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.300]   On their choices.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.300]   In order to form a complete mind, a complete
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.300]   human being, there's a kind of
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.300]   tension of that
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   autonomy versus
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   consuming as many varied
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   perspectives as possible, which is
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.300]   underlying the ethic of free speech.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   So on college campuses
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   it seems like
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   a good way to develop the mind
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   is to get as many perspectives as possible,
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   even if you don't really want to.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   Well that's,
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   that is the theory.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   Academic freedom is
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.300]   supposed to be
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   the highest degree
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   of free speech.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   You should be able to entertain
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.300]   all kinds of
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   hateful, threatening
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.300]   ideas, and the way
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   I put it is, there's something
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   wrong when you
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   can say something with complete
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   abandon without any fear
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   in Harvard Square, whereas
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.300]   on the other side of the fence, you can't say
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   it in Harvard Yard. It should be the
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   opposite. And what happens
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   is
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.300]   universities,
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   from the best to the worst, from the most
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   famous to the least well known,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.300]   have been taken over by
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   administrators.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   Administrators do not really
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   subsume academic values.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   They know nothing about the constitution,
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   they know nothing about free speech, they know
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.300]   nothing about academic freedom.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   They feel that their job is to keep order.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   And so
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   they develop speech
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.300]   codes, kangaroo courts
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   to enforce the speech codes,
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.300]   and these are
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.300]   very dire developments. I wrote about
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.300]   them in the shadow university in '98,
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   and
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   tried to deal with them
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   in 1999 when I started FIRE.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Code started FIRE.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.300]   And
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   I would
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   FIRE, the reason
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   I'm running currently for the Harvard Board
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   of Overseers is, what I'd like
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   to do is convince the Harvard Corporation
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   the so-called
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   president and fellows of Harvard College,
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   the chief governing board of the
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   university with the real power,
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.300]   the Board of Overseers
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   is a secondary body, but
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.300]   quite influential,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   to FIRE 95%
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   of the administrators.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   It would have a salutary
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   effect on the academics
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   of the university, it would have a salutary
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   effect on free speech and academic freedom,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   it would cut tuitions by about
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   40%,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   and it would create a whole
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   different atmosphere on the campus.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   And the same could be said of
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   MIT or any other place.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   I think administrators
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   are a
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   very
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   bad
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   influence on American
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   higher education.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   - Can you sort of elaborate the intuition
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   why this thing that you call
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   administrative bloat
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   is such a bad thing for a university?
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   - Well, first of all, just in terms
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   of the cost
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   of maintaining, there are
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.300]   more administrators in American higher education
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.300]   than there are faculty members.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   The cost is enormous.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   Number two,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.300]   they are
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.300]   inimical to the
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   teaching enterprise
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   and they
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   feel that their job is to control
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   things, to make sure there are no
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   problems and nobody's feelings are hurt.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   Being called,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   you know,
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   before a dean because
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.300]   you said something
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.300]   that insulted somebody
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   is something that shouldn't happen in American
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   higher education, yet it happens because
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   you have these administrators who think it's their job
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   to protect
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   people from being insulted.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.300]   You insult a black student,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   you insult a woman,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   there's a disciplinary hearing. Well, there
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.300]   shouldn't be.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   Black people
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   are accustomed
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   to being insulted. Jews
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.300]   are accustomed to being insulted.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   Women are accustomed to being insulted.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.300]   And it's very good
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   to know who doesn't like you.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.300]   It's useful.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   It is essential
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   information to know who doesn't like you.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   If everybody is forced to say
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   I love you and nobody can say I hate you,
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   you get a false view of what
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.300]   life is all about. - Outside of the
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   university. - Outside of the university.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.300]   You do graduate eventually.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.300]   - And that's ultimately the mission
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   of the university is to prepare you
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   to make you into a great human being,
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   into a great leader that can take on the problems of the world.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   - Correct. And you don't do it
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   by treating you like a little
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.300]   flower. - But what role
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   does the university have to protect students?
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.300]   To women,
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   African Americans,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   anybody, Jews, anybody who
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.300]   can be a victim of hate speech?
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   - They protect you
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   from physical assault. If somebody
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   physically assaults you,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   then they get
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   punished. But they shouldn't
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   protect you against
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.300]   insult because that is
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   a violation of academic freedom.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   The freedom of the insulter to insult
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   you. And also, as I said,
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   it's very useful to know
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   who doesn't like you. It's useful
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   for the so-called victim.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.300]   I think it's essential. I want to
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   know who doesn't like me.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   It's as important to me as knowing
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.300]   who likes me. - But
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.300]   do you also believe in this open
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   space of discourse,
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.300]   that the insulter will eventually lose?
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   - I think that's true.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.300]   I think that the insulter eventually
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   will wear out his or her welcome.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   I do.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.300]   But I like to know
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.300]   who the insult is.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   - Because it gives you a deeper understanding
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.300]   of human nature. - Yeah. And
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.300]   usually, by the way, my experience
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   has been that the insulters have generally
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   not been as smart as the people they've insulted.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   And that's probably
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   one of the reasons they insult them,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   because they feel inferior.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.300]   I mean, I'm not trying to be a
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   psychoanalyst
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   here, but a lot of the people who
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   are the haters are
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   pretty low down on the intellectual
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.300]   scale. - Anyway,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   95% of
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   administration, you would fire
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   your calling to fire
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.300]   95% of
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   the administration. People should know,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.300]   I think
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.300]   people that don't really think about
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.300]   the structure, the way the universities
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.300]   work, are not
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   familiar, I think, with the fact that
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   administration, there's a huge
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   bloat of administration.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   When you think about what makes a great university,
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.300]   it's about the students, it's about the faculty,
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.300]   it's about the people that do research, if it's a
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   research university.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.300]   They don't think about the bureaucracy
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   of meetings and committees and
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   rules and paperwork
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   and all that, and all the people that are
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   involved with pushing that kind of paper.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   And there's a huge cost to that, but it also
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   slows down
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   and suppresses the
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   beautiful variety
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   that makes a university great, which is
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.300]   the teaching, the student
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   life, the protests,
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.300]   the clubs,
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.300]   all the fun that you can have in a
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.300]   university, all the varied kind of exploration,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   which you can't really do once you graduate.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   - Correct. - It's the place, the university is
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.300]   a place to really explore.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   In every single way.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.300]   So let me just
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.300]   talk about this important thing, because
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   I'm very fortunate to have contacted you
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   almost by accident
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.300]   in a very important moment in your life.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   You're running for
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   the Harvard Board of
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   Overseers. What is
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   this board, how much power does it have,
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.300]   and what would you do
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   if elected? - Okay.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.300]   First of all, I have a prediction.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.300]   - Yes. - That in about five years, they're
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   gonna probably change the name because "Overseers"
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.300]   reminds people of the slavery
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.300]   era, and we're in
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   such a politically correct era now
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   that the English language
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   is being restricted, corrupted
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   is the way I put it,
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.300]   because certain words are
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   forbidden.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   We have some problems in this country,
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   and I think part of the problem is
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   the educational system
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   has lost the sense of what academic
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.300]   freedom and free speech are all about,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.300]   and
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   I think it's
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   essential that the
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   educational system begin to
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.300]   take more seriously what free
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   speech and academic freedom really are.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   That's why I'm running for the
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.300]   Harvard Board of Overseers.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   - So let me just link on the
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.300]   role of the
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   administration in protecting
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   free speech. So what often
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   happens, I think you've written about this, is there's
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.300]   going to be a few,
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.300]   maybe a small number of hypersensitive students
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.300]   and faculty that protest.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.300]   So how does Harvard administration
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.300]   resist
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   the influence of those hypersensitive
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   protesters in protecting
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.300]   speech,
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   in protecting even hate speech?
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   - Harvard has done fairly
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   well under the
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   presidency of Lawrence
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   Bacow. I have
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   had a couple of meetings with
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   Bacow.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.300]   I like Bacow.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   I have donated to Harvard
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   a print of my
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   late wife, took a
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   picture of Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   when the Rolling Thunder Review
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   got to Harvard Square,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   and it's sort of an
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300]   iconic photograph. She's called
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   it the music lesson because it's got Dylan
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   teaching Ginsberg how to play
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   the guitar. And I
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   donated one of those to Harvard.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   It's hanging in Bacow's
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   office. He,
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.300]   the new president,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.300]   Claudine Gay, is not
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   known for respecting academic freedom
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   and free speech. People
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   have said to me, well give her a chance. Well,
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   I'm willing to give her a chance, but
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   she does have a record. And
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   she's a bureaucrat.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   I don't think she believes in
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   free speech and academic freedom.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   I think she's a progressive, not a liberal.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   I'm not
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   happy with the
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   appointment
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   of Claudine Gay.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.300]   And it has made more essential
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   my attempt to get on the
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   Board of Overseers.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   - So let's talk about the Board of Overseers
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.300]   and your run
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   for it. The specifics, actually.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   It would be nice because
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   I think you're
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   a write-in candidate
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   and the election is over
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   on May 16th?
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   - Yes.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   - And I think there are specifics. I'll probably
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   give them in the intro. I'll give links to people.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.300]   But the specifics are complicated.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   Let me just mention
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   that you have to be
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   Harvard alumni. So I've
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   graduated from Harvard.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   - You have to, in order to run and in order to vote.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.300]   - In order to vote. And the process, I
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   imagine, is not trivial, but
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   this is done online.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   And if you're an alumni, you should have received
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   an email from a particular email
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   address: harvard@mgelectionservicescorp.com
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   And presumably there's a way
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   to get some validation number
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   from that email. And then you go
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   online, you enter that validation number,
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   and you vote. And to vote
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   for Harvey, you have to
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   enter his name
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   correctly: Harvey Silverglate.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   And spell it correctly.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   Obviously,
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   I'm imagining this, because I'm imagining
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   MIT, not Harvard. So I'm imagining
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.300]   the process is not trivial.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   You have to click on things, you have to
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.300]   sort of follow instructions that are not
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   trivial.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   And I'll also provide
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   an email if the process is
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   painful, it doesn't work for you, that you can
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   email. Email harvard and complain.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   IT help at
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   harvard.edu and so on. I'll provide all the links.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   But is there something else you can say
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   about the voting process,
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   what you're running on,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.300]   what you're doing?
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   This is my second run.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   The first time I got enough signatures
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   to get on the ballot.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   Then the
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   Harvard Alumni Association
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   sent out
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   a letter
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   to all living Harvard alums
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   recommending
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   that they vote for the
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   officially nominated
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   candidates. That excluded
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   two petition candidates
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   of whom I was one.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.300]   And
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   I wrote to the Alumni Association
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   and I said,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   "You have now sent out the
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   curricula vitaes
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   and the policy positions
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   of all the officially nominated
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.300]   candidates. There are two
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   petition candidates on the ballot.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   I would like to be able
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   to send out my
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   positions
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.300]   to the voters."
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   They wrote me back
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   saying, "Our policy
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   is to only send out
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   the policy positions
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   and the platforms of officially
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   nominated candidates. Can you believe
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   that?" Well,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   this is a liberal arts college,
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   right?
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   Where from the clash of ideas
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   truth emerges. Well, really?
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   This is what I call
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.300]   Harvard's not
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   so subtle means of
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   candidate suppression. Not voter
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.300]   suppression, candidate suppression.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   And
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   everybody can vote,
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   but not everybody can run.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.300]   It
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   ill becomes a
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   liberal arts college
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.300]   where the clash of ideas
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   will produce the truth. What about the clash of ideas
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.300]   of the Board of Overseers?
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   The Board of Overseers is important.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   It doesn't have the same
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   power and authority as the Harvard
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.300]   Corporation, the so-called
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.300]   President and Fellows of Harvard College.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.300]   But it's very influential
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.300]   and very important
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   and it would be a great perch for me
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   to try to exert
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.300]   influence for the university to get
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   back to where it was
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   before it was taken over by the administrators.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.300]   Well, I'm pretty sure that
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.300]   most of Harvard alumni,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   most of the students currently going to Harvard,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   most of the faculty at Harvard
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   probably stand behind the ideas
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   and the ideals that you stand behind.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.300]   Yep. The people
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.300]   that love Harvard and what it stands for.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   See, the alumni were educated
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   in an era when these concepts
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   were taken more seriously
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   and before the
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.300]   administration, the administrators took over.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   So I do think
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.300]   if I get my message out, I'm going to win the seat.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.300]   And if I win a seat,
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   I will have a great perch
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   for
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.300]   trying to convince the real
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.300]   power that be, which is the Harvard Corporation,
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.300]   to do the things
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   that I'm suggesting. You know, get rid of
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   95% of the administrators,
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   get rid of their speech codes,
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.300]   reduce tuition by 40%,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   all of these salutary
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.300]   benefits.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.300]   Can you imagine if Harvard became
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   the most affordable college in the United States?
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   Well, the affordability is another aspect,
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   but I think before
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   that, just the freedom of expression,
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   freedom of speech, freedom of thought,
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   at America's greatest universities,
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   I think is something that
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.300]   everybody would agree on.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   It would have a
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   tremendous effect on the whole country.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   And is there something to say about the details
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   of how difficult it is
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   for alumni to vote?
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.300]   Well,
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   you could vote online,
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   or you can vote by paper ballot,
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.300]   you could request a paper ballot.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   And all I could say is that
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.300]   the hard part is getting the message out.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.300]   My name doesn't appear on the ballot
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.300]   because I couldn't get enough
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   signatures.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   Well, Harvey,
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   Harvey,
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   he's a great guy.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   Harvey Silverglate.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.300]   S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   You know, when my
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   grandparents arrived from
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   Russia,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.300]   the name
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.300]   in Russian was something like Zilbaglate.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   And the immigration
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   officer had several choices.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   He could have said Silvergate.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   Gate is a real,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   silver and gate are real English words.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   He could have said
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.300]   Silverglade, G-L-A-D-E.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300]   Those are real English words.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   That's how my name is often
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.300]   spelled, either Silvergate or Silverglade.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   Silverglate
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   is a nonsense syllable.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   And why the immigration
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.300]   officer chose to
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.300]   transliterate Zilbaglate
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   as Silverglade,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.300]   I'll never understand.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   And it is the cause of endless
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   mistakes in my name.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.300]   Well, the fundamental
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.300]   absurdity of life
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.300]   is also the source of its beauty.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   Yes. Anyway,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.300]   we shall spell it out
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   and we shall get
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   yell loud and
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.300]   wide that everybody
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.300]   who has ever graduated from Harvard should vote
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   for you if they believe in the ideals
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   of the great American universities,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   which I think most people do.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.300]   Let me also
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.300]   ask about
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   diversity, inclusion, and equity programs.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   You've been, you've had a few
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.300]   harsh words to say about those.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   You know, the idea of diversity
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   I think is a beautiful idea.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   You said that Harvard's idea of diversity
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   is for everyone to look different
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   and think alike. Correct.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.300]   Can you elaborate? And be comfortable.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   And be comfortable. Yeah.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.300]   First of all, it is impossible
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   if liberal arts education is taken
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.300]   seriously, it's impossible
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.300]   for students to feel comfortable.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   Why? Because one of
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.300]   the roles of college is to challenge
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   all the beliefs that they
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.300]   grew up with, which mostly are the beliefs
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.300]   inculcated by parents
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.300]   and by elementary school teachers.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   And
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   the idea is to be able to
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   challenge those
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   thoughts, those ideas.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   And if you don't have free speech
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   and academic freedom, those views
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.300]   get reified,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   they do not get challenged.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   So it is,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   it violates
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.300]   the fundamental role of
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   higher educational institutions
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   to have any restrictions
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   at all.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.300]   That's number one.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   Number two,
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.300]   as I think I said earlier,
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.300]   if people, students are not
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.300]   allowed to be frank with one another,
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   they don't really learn about one another.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   And
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   you know,
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   I've given a lot
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   of lectures in which I
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   have said, and I think
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   students now understand
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.300]   it, I'm much
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.300]   more interested in hearing from the people who hate me
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.300]   than the people who love me.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   I'm much more interested in knowing
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   who disagrees with me than people who agree with me.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   That's how
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   I learn, and
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.300]   that's how they learn,
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   the clash of ideas,
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   which is the theory behind the First
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.300]   Amendment.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   That truth will somehow emerge,
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.300]   or if not truth, at least a better truth,
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   a truer truth,
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   a more useful truth,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   if ideas
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.300]   are allowed to clash.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   Especially in the structure of a university where
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.300]   at least I would say there's some
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   set of rules, some set of civility.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   I think I would rather
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   read Mein Kampf
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   to understand people that hate.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   There is also a quality
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   to disagreement that
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   we should strive for, and I think a university is a
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   place where when
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   disagreement and even hate is allowed,
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   it's done in a high
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   effort way. You know, somebody
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   asked me once about what
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   books I would, what I have
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   as required reading
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   in literature courses, and I
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   listed Mein Kampf.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.300]   And they were horrified. And I said,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   "Well, it's one of the most important books of the
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   20th century."
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.300]   Six million Jews died,
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   an enormous number of other people died,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   because one guy wrote a
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   book called Mein Kampf and took it seriously.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   It's one of the most important
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   books ever written. How can
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   an educated person
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   not have at least
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   breezed through Mein Kampf?
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   And...
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.300]   It's not a great read, though.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   He was not a great writer.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   But you do get a sense
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   for the sociopath
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   that was Adolf Hitler. Yes.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   Because he really acted on the words
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   that he wrote. Yeah.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.300]   And it was there, and if people took that
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.300]   work seriously, Correct.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   they would have understood.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   It's one of the most important books of the 20th century.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   And it's politically
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.300]   incorrect to read it. It's crazy.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.300]   But can you
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.300]   speak to the
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   um...
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   the efforts to increase diversity
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.300]   in universities,
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   which I think is embodied in this
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   D.I.E. effort of
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.300]   diversity, inclusion, and equity
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   programs. Where do
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.300]   they go right? Where do they go wrong?
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   Okay, let me tell you, first of all,
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   this may surprise a lot of people.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   I am opposed
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   to affirmative action.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   Um...
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   And I think that
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.300]   what it does
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   is it...
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   labels people by
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.300]   their race, by their
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   religion, and by their national
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   origin. Precisely
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   what we don't want people to
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   do is be pigeonholed
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.300]   in those categories.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.300]   The reason that
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.300]   affirmative action has become
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   the way that universities
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.300]   decide on who gets admitted
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   is because historically
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   people in what's called
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   marginalized groups
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   blacks, gays,
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.300]   Hispanics
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   have been
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   discriminated against in the
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.300]   admissions process.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.300]   Now, what
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.300]   I have suggested
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.300]   is that instead of affirmative
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.300]   action, and by the way,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.300]   here's a prediction. The Supreme Court is
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   going to abolish affirmative action.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.300]   There's a case pending, a Harvard case.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   Um...
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   It's...
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   There are two cases joined together, one of a
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   public university and one of a private
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   university. The private university is
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.300]   Harvard.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   I predict that the Supreme Court
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.300]   will vote 6-3 to abolish affirmative
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   action.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.300]   It is... On its face,
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   it is a violation of equal
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   protection of the law.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   Some groups are
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   favored because of race
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   or ethnicity. It is a
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   classic violation of equal
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   protection clause.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.300]   When affirmative action was
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   approved,
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   the deciding vote was Justice Sandra Day
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.300]   O'Connor. She wrote
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   a very famous opinion
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.300]   in which she said,
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.300]   "I hesitate to vote
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   to keep up, to affirm
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   the notion of affirmative action
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.300]   because it's such an obvious violation
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   of equal protection.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   But we have an urgent problem in the society.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   We are not educating
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.300]   our
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   members of racial
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   and ethnic minorities
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.300]   and we have to try
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.300]   to get them into our colleges."
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.300]   So, I
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   think it should be approved for 25
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   years.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   And it will...
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300]   It should be...
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   It should... In 25 years,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.300]   it should have performed its role.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   Well, it hasn't.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   And the 25 years is coming
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.300]   up. I think it's three
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.300]   or four years left.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   The Supreme Court is going to abolish it.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   You can take my word for that.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.300]   Because it is such an obvious
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.300]   violation of equal protection.
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   Why do... Why did affirmative
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   action come into play?
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.300]   Because the secondary
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.300]   and elementary schools are so bad.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.300]   Public secondary
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.300]   and elementary schools are so bad.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.300]   Why are they so bad? Partly
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   because of the control that the teachers'
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   union has.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.300]   Randy Weingarten runs
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.300]   the public school system in the United States.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   And what I have
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.300]   suggested is that
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   the
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.300]   effort should be to...
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.300]   This is an emergency.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.300]   It's a national emergency
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.300]   to improve
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   the
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.300]   quality of
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   elementary and secondary education.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.300]   And one way
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   to do it is to hire teachers
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.300]   who are fabulous
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.300]   teachers rather than necessarily
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.300]   members of the union.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   I have come to oppose
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   public
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.300]   workers' unions.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.300]   I am a very strong
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   supporter of
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.300]   unions in the private sector.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   Why do I
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   think there's such a difference between
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   unions in the public sector and the private
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.300]   sector? In the private
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   sector, management
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   is arguing,
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   bargaining with its own money
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   and with the money of shareholders.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.300]   In the public sector,
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.300]   there's only one side.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.300]   There is the teachers' union
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   and then there's a school committee that is dealing
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.300]   with the taxpayers' money, not their own.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.300]   And so it's a very
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   skewed
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.300]   power balance.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.300]   So,
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.300]   as supportive as I am of private
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   sector unions, I am in
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.300]   opposition of public
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.300]   sector unions. They're very destructive.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   And I think without
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   teachers' union,
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   teachers who
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   are really skilled will be able to get
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   jobs. They would not have to worry
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.300]   about the seniority of teachers who
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.300]   long since have given up really
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   creative teaching.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.300]   And we have
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.300]   to improve the public educational
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.300]   system.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.300]   I had,
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.300]   my late wife and I
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.300]   had a classmate,
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   we have a son who's now 44 who went to
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.300]   the public schools in Cambridge.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.300]   He has
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   a friend, first name
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   Eugene, who was
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.300]   a black kid from Roxbury, whose mother
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   understood that the schools
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   in Roxbury were terrible, the schools in Cambridge
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   were pretty good.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.300]   He lived in our house
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.300]   Monday to Friday, and he
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.300]   went to school with Isaac in the Cambridge
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.300]   public schools.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.300]   Elsa and I would show up
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   to school committee meetings when there was
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.300]   bargaining between the teachers'
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.300]   union and the school committee.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.300]   The teachers' union objected
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.300]   to our being there.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   We argued,
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.300]   we're taxpayers. We have
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   a kid in the school, and we have
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   his best
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.300]   friend lives with us, and
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   goes to school with him.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.300]   We have a real interest.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   And the
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   school committee walked
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.300]   out of the bargaining session.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.300]   The city council then reconsidered
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   its vote, and they voted that
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   citizens,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.300]   taxpayers,
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.300]   parents of kids in the school,
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.300]   could not show up
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.300]   to these negotiation
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.300]   sessions. I thought that was
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.300]   absolutely outrageous.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.300]   But I understood why.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.300]   Because these contracts
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.300]   are crazy.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.300]   No sane
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.300]   municipality should
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.300]   enter into some of these contracts.
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.300]   And
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.300]   so I am a
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.300]   I have become
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.300]   an opponent of the
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   National Teachers Association. They came
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.300]   to the
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.300]   Teachers Association.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.300]   I don't think there should be unions
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.300]   for public employees.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   Because there's no real bargaining
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.300]   going on.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   And I think that the public school
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.300]   system will never be improved
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.300]   as long as the
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.300]   teachers are unionized.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.300]   So that to you
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   is at the core of the problem that results
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.300]   in the kind of
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.300]   inequality of opportunity
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.300]   that affirmative actions
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   is designed to solve.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.300]   Correct. If the educational system in the
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.300]   elementary and high school levels
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.300]   is improved, we wouldn't need
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.300]   affirmative action. These kids
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.300]   would get good educations.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   So from all backgrounds,
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   poor kids in the United States
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   will get good education
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.300]   if
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   public unions are abolished.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.300]   Correct.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.300]   And incidentally, the postal service
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.300]   would probably work better too.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   That's a whole
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   another conversation. But to you,
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   at the core of the problem of the
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   inequality in
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.300]   universities, that
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   diversity, inclusion, and equity
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.300]   programs are trying to solve is
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   the public education system
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.300]   of secondary education.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   Correct. Elementary and secondary.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   Elementary and secondary education.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.300]   Well then, is there use?
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   What is the benefit? What is
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   the drawback of
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.300]   D.I.E., diversity,
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   inclusion, and equity programs at universities
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   like Harvard? It's an affirmative action,
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   basically.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.300]   And what it does is it allows
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.300]   the system of
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   elementary and secondary
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.300]   education to be bad.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.300]   Because they could say, "Oh, we got our kids into
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   Harvard." Yes, but you haven't
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   educated them.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.300]   And it covers up the wound.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.300]   And
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   I think we will never improve
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.300]   as long as we're able to cover up the wound.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.300]   And as I said, affirmative action is going to
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   be abolished by the Supreme Court.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.300]   It's a clear violation
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.300]   of equal protection. It's what
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.300]   San Francisco Day O'Connor understood
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.300]   but ignored
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   intentionally,
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.300]   but as an experiment.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.300]   And I believe
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.300]   it's going to be abolished, and that's going to
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   force
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.300]   the elementary and high schools
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.300]   to get serious.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.300]   Do you see the same issues that you discuss now
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.300]   at Harvard,
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.300]   at MIT? We're here in Boston, so I have to
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   talk about the great universities here in Boston.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.300]   You've written about MIT.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.300]   It's a university I love.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.300]   I'm a research scientist there.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   Do you see the same kind of issues there?
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.300]   Yes, I do.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.300]   Do you remember, can you explain the case of
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   the Dorian Abbott lecture that was canceled
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.300]   at MIT?
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   This is not
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.300]   the only
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   incident.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   There have been incidents all around the country
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   of
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   academics, professors
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.300]   who have views that don't comport
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.300]   the same way.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.300]   I think
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.300]   that's a good point.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   I think
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   I think
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.300]   I think
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.300]   I think
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.300]   I think
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   I think
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   I think
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   that's a good point.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.300]   I think
