[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It is the most important right that Americans have.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.540]   It's not a coincidence or an accident
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.180]   that it's named in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.420]   Without it, no democratic society
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.300]   can be democratic for long.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.960]   And I'm an absolutist.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.920]   That is, I believe that, for example,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.080]   people say to me, "But what about hate speech?"
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.600]   And the reason is, I'm much more interested
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.120]   in knowing whom I should not turn my back on
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.840]   than I am interested in figuring out who loves me.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.960]   - The following is a conversation with Harvey Silverglate,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.080]   a legendary free speech advocate, co-founder of FIRE,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.680]   the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.760]   and the author of several books
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.440]   on the freedom of speech and criminal justice,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.920]   including "The Shadow University,"
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520]   the Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.080]   Harvey is running to be
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.480]   on the Harvard Board of Overseers this year
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   with the write-in campaign,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.160]   so you have to spell his name correctly, Silverglate.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.520]   Promising to advocate for free speech
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.000]   and to push for reducing the size
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.520]   of Harvard's administration bureaucracy,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920]   election is over this Tuesday, May 16th, at 5 p.m. Eastern.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.560]   To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.520]   So if you happen to be one, please vote online.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440]   It's a good way to support freedom of speech
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.200]   on Harvard campus.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920]   Instructions how to do so are in the description.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   As a side note, please allow me to say
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.040]   that since there are several
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.000]   controversial conversations coming up,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   I tried to make sure that this podcast
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.400]   is a platform for free discourse
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.040]   where ideas are not censored but explored,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.040]   and if necessary, challenged
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.640]   in a thoughtful and pathetic way.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.080]   It's by having such difficult conversations,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   not by avoiding them,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.400]   that we can begin to heal divides
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.240]   and to shed light on the dark parts
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.400]   of human history and human nature.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.440]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.840]   in the description.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   And now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.760]   You co-founded the Foundation
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960]   for Individual Rights and Expression,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.040]   also known as FIRE, a legendary organization
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   that fights for the freedom of speech
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.800]   for all Americans in our courtrooms,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.760]   on our campuses, and in our culture.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   So let's start with the big question.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.720]   What is freedom of speech?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080]   - First of all, the organization,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.840]   when I co-founded it in 1999,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.880]   was called the Foundation
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.120]   for Individual Rights in Education.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.880]   It focused on free speech issues
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.160]   on college campuses in academia,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   and only earlier this year did we decide
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.560]   to expand our reach beyond the campuses,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   which is why the name,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.640]   although the acronym FIRE remains,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160]   it's now the Foundation
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.720]   for Individual Rights and Expression.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.200]   - The E used to be education.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.640]   - The E used to be education.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   It's now expression.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.360]   And we basically do a lot of the cases
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.920]   the ACLU used to do.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   The ACLU now more is a progressive organization
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.680]   rather than a civil liberties organization.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.760]   And we've taken the role
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.160]   of dealing with free speech
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.680]   in the society generally.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920]   And now this is a particularly,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   in the era prone to censorship.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.280]   Everybody thinks they're right,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.440]   and that people who disagree with them
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.240]   should not be able to voice their views.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.960]   It's a very difficult period right now,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   both on campus and off campus.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.880]   It's about as intolerant an era
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.400]   as I can remember.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.360]   I'm gonna be 81 May 10th.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.720]   I was born on Mother's Day, 1942.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.200]   And I can't remember it being this bad.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.580]   I was born during the McCarthy era.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.480]   - So that says a lot.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.000]   - And it sort of reminds me of that.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.680]   - Let's start with that,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   almost a philosophical question,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.560]   a legal question, a human question.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.480]   What is this freedom that you care so much about,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.760]   that you fought for so much,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.920]   freedom of speech?
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.160]   - It is the most important right that Americans have.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.440]   It's not a coincidence or an accident
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.000]   that it's named in the First Amendment
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.100]   to the Constitution.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.320]   Without it, no democratic society
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.220]   can be democratic for long.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   And I'm an absolutist.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.840]   That is, I believe that, for example,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   people say to me, "But what about hate speech?"
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.200]   Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.520]   And the reason is I'm much more interested
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   in knowing whom I should not turn my back on
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   than I am interested in figuring out who loves me
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.960]   or who likes me.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.800]   So hate speech is the most important, in my view.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.360]   And yet it's banned in, for example, schools.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.640]   It's unbelievable.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.200]   Kids are not schooled into understanding
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.880]   the glory of the First Amendment
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.320]   when schools say to them they shouldn't say things
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.220]   that are gonna make somebody feel bad.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.760]   I mean, the purpose of speech is to express
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.720]   honest views that people have.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.440]   And so I believe hate speech is as important as love speech,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.640]   and my view is more important.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.200]   - So it should be brought to the surface
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.520]   rather than operate in shadows.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.400]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   - What is the connection between freedom of speech
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.300]   and freedom of thought?
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.700]   - Well, in a free society,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.400]   thoughts start in the brain
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   and then they come out the mouth.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.440]   So they're different ends of the same spectrum.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   - So to you, the censorship of speech
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.880]   eventually leads to a censorship of thought.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.160]   - Of course, censorship of the mode
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.120]   by which other people know what you're thinking.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120]   - So there's some aspect of our society
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.080]   that thinking is done collectively,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.920]   and without being able to speak to each other,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.160]   we cannot do this kind of collective thinking.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.800]   - And out of speech, the theory is that ultimately,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.880]   out of speech comes truth.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080]   That isn't necessarily so,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.300]   but I do think that when there's free speech,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.360]   better decisions are made
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.160]   because people put their views on the table
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.300]   in a frank, accurate way,
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.300]   and then those views mix together and clash,
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.660]   and out of that usually comes the better decision.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.820]   Not always, but usually, or more often than not.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.320]   But if somebody is not allowed to sit at the table
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.920]   of decision making, then the decision making process
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   is poorer, less robust, less diverse,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.600]   and ultimately less successful.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.400]   - So can you elaborate on the idea
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.440]   of free speech absolutism?
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.240]   So hate speech can be quite painful
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.480]   to quite a large number of people.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.680]   Does this worry you?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.880]   - Yep.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Living in a free society requires
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.400]   that you expose yourself to some discomfort.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.200]   You call it pain.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.240]   It's maybe emotional pain.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.780]   It's not physical pain,
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.880]   but it's the price we pay for living in a free society.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.740]   Every so often, we're insulted.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.640]   We're emotionally hurt.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.260]   Think of the alternative.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.500]   All the alternatives are worse.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.760]   Nobody ever promised us a rose garden.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.040]   We're lucky to be in a country that has the First Amendment.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.800]   It's also the most diverse country in the world
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.160]   because of immigration.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.760]   My grandparents, my father's side came over from Russia.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.700]   My mother's side came over from Poland.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.200]   I'm very happy that my grandparents came in from Russia.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.360]   I would not want to be in Russia today.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.820]   I'd probably be sharing a cell
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.620]   with a Wall Street Journal reporter.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:37.240]   So I'm thankful that they came in.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.220]   And this is a great country.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.160]   It's got troubles right now, but our country doesn't.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.240]   And we've had, before we had a civil war,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   we had segregation.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.620]   We had the decimation of the Indians.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.640]   We're not perfect, but it's the best place in the world
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.240]   for somebody who values liberty.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.640]   - So you don't think that hate speech
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   can empower large groups that eventually
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.420]   lead to physical action, to physical harm to others?
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.260]   - No, I don't.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.480]   I think that we have developed a culture
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.920]   in which it's understood that if you don't like
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.780]   what you hear, you talk back.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.220]   You write something.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.520]   We don't punch each other, we insult each other.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.000]   Is insulting great?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.940]   Well, I don't know, it's okay.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.800]   As a kid in Brooklyn, where I was born,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.480]   I was born and raised in Bensonhurst,
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   we used to say, "Sticks and stones can break my bones,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.100]   "but names can never harm me."
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.840]   And it's absolutely true.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.320]   What was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.520]   So I've lived a long time, I've seen it all.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   And I'm talking from experience as well as theory.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.540]   It's what happens when you reach your 80s.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.720]   - I read that you had this line that you cannot
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.920]   be protected from being called an asshole.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.160]   - Correct.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.800]   Especially if you're an asshole.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.960]   (Lex laughing)
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.200]   - Well, that's, but you don't have to be an asshole
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   to be called an asshole.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.860]   - That's correct.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.340]   - And I think the internet has taught me that.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.160]   - Well, the internet has posed a particular challenge
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   to free speech absolutists because of some
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.740]   of the stuff that's on there is god awful.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.700]   But I have no different rule for freedom of speech
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.120]   on the internet than I have in newspapers or in lectures
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.680]   or in classrooms or conversations among people.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.040]   - What do you think about the tension between freedom
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.480]   of speech and freedom of reach as is sometimes termed?
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.040]   So the internet really challenges that aspect.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.560]   It allows speech to become viral and spread
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.520]   very quickly to a very large number of people.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.560]   - Well, you know, we've had revolutions
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   in the modalities of communication.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.580]   After all, newspapers were the first challenge.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.820]   Radio and television posed a new challenge.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:19.120]   The FCC tried, but ultimately gave up the attempt
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   to control obscenity, for example.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.480]   And the Supreme Court has been pretty close.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.080]   The one thing that liberal and conservative
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.920]   Supreme Courts, right now we're in a conservative era
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.740]   due to Trump nominations.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.600]   During much of my life, the Warren Court,
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.680]   it was William O. Douglas, Brennan,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.800]   it was a liberal court.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.360]   One thing they agree on is free speech.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.400]   They don't agree on much else,
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   but they do agree on free speech.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   And I think the reason is that they recognize that,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.320]   well, my group is in the ascendance today,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   but it may not be tomorrow, and I wanna have objective,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.120]   clear rules so that when I'm in the minority,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.980]   I'm able to voice my opinion.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.600]   And so it's one of the few things
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.480]   that both sides of the political spectrum agree on.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.200]   The only people who don't are the people
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.760]   way over on the right that I call the fascists,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.280]   and the people way over on the left,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.540]   who are the communists.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.060]   But with respect to most people on the political spectrum,
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.520]   Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, Libertarians,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:44.080]   they agree on the primacy of free speech
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.560]   because it protects them when protection is needed.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.580]   - So to you, even on the internet,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.160]   free speech absolutism should rule.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.480]   - Yes.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.120]   Nobody's gonna die.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.660]   Remember, death threats are not protected.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.800]   Nobody's gonna die.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.020]   So people are gonna be a little bit insulted.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.160]   That's the price you pay for living in a free society.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.080]   And it's a small price, in my view.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.000]   Some people don't have as tough a hide as others.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.660]   Well, then develop it.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.040]   I don't mean to sound cruel,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.240]   but you're living in a free society.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.720]   Develop a tough hide.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.680]   - So that's the cost of living in a free society.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.600]   - Yep, there's a cost.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.540]   - The thing is that it can really hurt at scale
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.160]   to be cyberbullied, to be attacked
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.400]   for the ideas you express,
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.200]   or maybe ideas you didn't express,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.160]   but that somebody decided to lie about you
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.240]   and use that to attack you.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.600]   - Well, first of all,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.520]   there are some exceptions to the First Amendment.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.900]   Libel and slander is an exception.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.220]   Direct threats are an exception.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.160]   If you say such and such, I will murder you.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.200]   That is not lawful.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.740]   If you say about somebody,
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.080]   oh, you beat your wife,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.920]   that is not lawful if, in fact,
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.480]   the person knows you don't beat your wife.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.160]   There are some limits.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.520]   Defamation is one.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.900]   Direct threats are another.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:32.160]   The First Amendment is not absolute,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.720]   but it's more absolute than it is in any other society,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.920]   and it's pretty near absolute.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.360]   For example, fraud.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.140]   If you sell somebody a car,
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.240]   and you say, oh, this is in great running shape,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.920]   and in fact, it's an old jalopy,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.700]   and it's not gonna make it more than 10 miles,
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.840]   that's fraud.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.200]   That's not free speech.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.920]   So free speech is not absolute.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.140]   There are these limits,
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.240]   but they're very narrow, specific categories of limits.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.860]   - But there's gray area here,
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.280]   because while legally you're not allowed
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.320]   to defame a person,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.120]   in the court of public opinion,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.760]   especially with the aid of anonymity on the internet,
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.000]   rumors can spread at scale.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.960]   Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.640]   can make up things about you.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.720]   - You have to defend yourself.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.760]   - Using more speech.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.200]   - We're big, we're through freedom of speech,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.700]   we're big boys and girls.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.120]   You have to defend yourself.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   In some societies, if you say something,
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.720]   if you, right now, if you say something nasty about Putin,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.380]   you'll end up in the gulag.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.680]   If you say something nasty about Biden,
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.160]   you end up in the New York Times.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.520]   Where would you rather be?
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.760]   - Well, let's talk about the thing you've done
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.940]   for over 20 years,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.440]   which is fight for the freedom of speech
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.480]   on college campuses.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.400]   So why is freedom of speech important on college campuses?
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.840]   - Well, it's important everywhere in the society,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.320]   but it's most important on college campuses.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.600]   Why?
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.340]   'Cause that's where we educate our young citizens.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.040]   And if you are educated under a notion
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   that some dean can call you on the carpet,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.720]   because you say something which is considered racist,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.040]   or you can say something which is considered
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.140]   dangerous to social cohesion,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.600]   then it's not a liberal arts college, no.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.560]   The theory that I used in The Shadow University--
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.760]   - A book you've written, The Shadow University.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.040]   - 1998.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.880]   - 1998.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.800]   You were ahead of a lot of these things, by the way.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.720]   - I'm afraid that as a pessimist,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.280]   I always saw the bad side of things.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.600]   - Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.320]   The Shadow University, a book you co-authored
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.200]   with Alan Charles.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.440]   - With one of my Princeton classmates, Alan Charles Coors,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.080]   who's now an emeritus professor of Enlightenment history
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.640]   at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.280]   I only taught for one semester,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.240]   and I can go into that later,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.040]   the reason that I did not continue to teach in colleges.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.180]   It was Harvard Law School I taught a course in the mid-1980s.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.640]   But in any event, the college campuses
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.200]   are one of the most important for free speech,
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.840]   because this is where people get education.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.400]   And if you don't really get a good education,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.560]   if certain points of view are not allowed to be expressed,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.800]   because education comes from the clash of ideas,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.320]   and you then have to decide,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.700]   this is how you become a thinking adult.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.120]   You have to decide which ideas make more sense to you,
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.760]   which ones you're gonna follow.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.360]   The college experience is transformative.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.800]   And if there is censorship on campuses,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   it's highly destructive of the educational enterprise,
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.880]   and ultimately to the entire society.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   We have in the sciences, we have a scientific method.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.840]   Scientific method is you try experiments,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.700]   and you see which ones work,
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.220]   and then you develop theories
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.780]   based upon the results of experiments.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.060]   Well, this is not much different
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.380]   from every other aspect of life.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.020]   You have to entertain different views on different subjects.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.220]   You hear all the views, and you make a decision
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.960]   as to which one's accurate, which one's not.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.780]   So the scientific method I apply to non-science,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.780]   to history, to journalism, to all of these things.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.440]   - So that scientific method includes ideas,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.600]   hateful ideas also?
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.280]   - Correct, if you don't allow hateful ideas.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.500]   I mean, when scientists do experiments,
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.800]   nobody says to them, oh, you know,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.840]   don't do that experiment, because it would be very bad
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.360]   if that turns out to be accurate, that outcome.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.760]   That's not the way it works.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:20.160]   Every point of view is thrown into the marketplace,
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.060]   whether it's science, or whether it's,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.120]   you know, non-science.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.200]   - And that includes the kind of ideas
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.400]   and the kind of discourse that might actually
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.280]   lead to an increase in hate on campuses?
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.760]   - The First Amendment prohibits speech
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   which is liable to produce imminent, imminent violence.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.800]   So for example, you know, the exception is yelling falsely,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.680]   falsely yelling fire in a crowded movie theater.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.360]   A lot of people misstate it.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.400]   They say, oh, the exception is yelling fire
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.240]   in a movie theater.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.120]   Well, if there's really a fire,
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.760]   you're performing a real important function
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.460]   by yelling fire. - You don't mention that part.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.720]   - But it's falsely yelling fire.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.680]   You start a riot, people would be crushed trying to get out.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.200]   So there are these, that's one of the exceptions,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.040]   the First Amendment, as the Supreme Court has defined it.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.860]   There are very few exceptions.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.000]   And defamation is an exception.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.880]   I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   But if you say something about somebody
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.320]   that has serious implications in their life,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.480]   in their ability to earn a living,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.400]   if you say, accuse somebody of being a pedophile
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.800]   when it's not true, that person can sue you.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.040]   My own view is I think that's an unfortunate exception,
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.320]   but I'm not on the Supreme Court.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.040]   I think that I'm with, a friend of mine was Nat Hentoff.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.940]   Nat Hentoff, who wrote for decades
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.840]   for the Village Voice in New York.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.480]   He was a friend of mine.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.120]   He was a free speech absolutist.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.760]   And he wrote a fabulous book called
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.160]   Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.920]   And he was an absolutist, and I'm with Nat Hentoff.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.360]   - Even on the defamation aspect.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.320]   I mean, I agree with you in some sense,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.240]   just practically speaking.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.080]   It seems like that the way, the best way
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.000]   in the public sphere to defend against defamation
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.240]   is with more speech.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.120]   - Correct.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.200]   - And through authenticity, through authentic communication
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.360]   of the truth as you see it.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   - Yeah, you know, at times, the Boston Globe
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.840]   has said something about me that hasn't been accurate.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.000]   They have invariably published my letter to the editor.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I'm also not bashful about getting in touch
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.840]   with the reporter.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.120]   At the end of every column,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.460]   they give the reporter's email address.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.180]   And I know people say that I have more access
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.940]   to the media than most people.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.960]   But all that means is I get the fame more than most people.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   - Can we also comment on, from the individual,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.200]   consumer of speech?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.400]   There's a kind of sense that freedom of speech
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.120]   means you should be forced to read all of it.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.040]   Freedom of speech versus freedom of reach.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.800]   We as consumers of speech, do we have the right
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.360]   to select what we read?
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   - We do.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.760]   And nobody can force us to sit in a room
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.320]   and listen to a radio program
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.080]   that we don't wanna listen to.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.920]   Nobody can force us to read a book
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.160]   that we don't wanna read.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.800]   The whole notion of freedom of speech
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   means that people have autonomy on their choices.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.760]   - In order to form a complete mind
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   and complete human being, there's a kind of tension
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.520]   of that autonomy versus consuming
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.320]   as many varied perspectives as possible,
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.600]   which is underlying the ethic of free speech.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.120]   So on college campuses, it seems like a good way
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.720]   to develop the mind is to get as many perspectives
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.160]   as possible, even if you don't really want to.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.360]   - Well, that is the theory.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.240]   Academic freedom is supposed to be
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.320]   the highest degree of free speech.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.720]   You should be able to entertain all kinds of hateful,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.600]   threatening ideas, and the way I put it is,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.640]   there's something wrong when you can say something
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.200]   with complete abandon without any fear in Harvard Square,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.800]   whereas on the other side of the fence,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.560]   you can't say it in Harvard Yard.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.000]   It should be the opposite.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.520]   And what happens is universities,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.760]   from the best to the worst, from the most famous
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.640]   to the least well-known, have been taken over
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.520]   by administrators.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.560]   Administrators do not really subsume academic values.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.440]   They know nothing about the Constitution.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   They know nothing about free speech.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.240]   They know nothing about academic freedom.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.600]   They feel that their job is to keep order.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   And so they develop speech codes, kangaroo courts,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.340]   to enforce the speech codes,
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.680]   and these are very dire developments.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.640]   I wrote about them in the Shadow University in '98.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   And tried to deal with them in 1999 when I started FIRE,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.880]   co-started FIRE, and I would FIRE,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.360]   the reason I'm running currently for the Harvard Board
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   of Overseers is what I'd like to do is convince
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.240]   the Harvard Corporation, so-called president and fellows
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.080]   of Harvard College, the chief governing board
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.000]   of the university with the real power,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.920]   the Board of Overseers is a secondary body,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   but quite influential, to FIRE 95% of the administrators.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.600]   It would have a salutary effect on the academics
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.760]   of the university, it would have a salutary effect
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.960]   on free speech and academic freedom.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.760]   It would cut tuitions by about 40%,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.940]   and it would create a whole different atmosphere
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.880]   on the campus, and the same could be said of MIT
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.080]   or any other place.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   I think administrators are a very bad influence
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   on American higher education.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   - Can you sort of elaborate the intuition
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.400]   of why this thing that you call administrative bloat
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.200]   is such a bad thing for a university?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.360]   - Well, first of all, just in terms of the cost
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.520]   of maintaining, there are more administrators
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   in American higher education than there are faculty members.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.240]   The cost is enormous.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   Number two, they are inimical to the teaching enterprise,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.680]   and they feel that their job is to control things,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.760]   to make sure there are no problems,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.400]   that nobody's feelings are hurt.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:28.600]   Being called before a dean because you said something
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.000]   that insulted somebody is something that shouldn't happen
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.920]   in American higher education, yet it happens
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.440]   because you have these administrators
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.720]   who think it's their job to protect people
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.760]   from being insulted.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.600]   You insult a black student, you insult a woman.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.920]   There's a disciplinary hearing.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.160]   Well, there shouldn't be.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.760]   Black people are accustomed to being insulted.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.560]   Jews are accustomed to being insulted.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.860]   Women are accustomed to being insulted,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.900]   and it's very good to know who doesn't like you.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.940]   It's useful.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.940]   It is essential information to know who doesn't like you.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.020]   If everybody is forced to say I love you
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.740]   and nobody can say I hate you,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.660]   you get a false view of what life is all about.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.940]   - Outside of the university.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.020]   - Outside the university.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.540]   I mean, you do graduate eventually.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.180]   - And that's ultimately the mission of the university
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.080]   is to prepare you to make you into a great human being,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.620]   into a great leader that can take on
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.540]   the problems of the world.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.140]   - Correct, and you don't do it
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.500]   by treating you like a little flower.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.060]   - But what role does the university
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.080]   have to protect students?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.420]   To women, African Americans, anybody, Jews,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.420]   anybody who can be a victim of hate speech?
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.660]   - They protect you from physical assault.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.140]   If somebody physically assaults you,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.260]   then they get punished,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.580]   but they shouldn't protect you against insult
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.220]   because that is a violation of academic freedom,
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.980]   the freedom of the insulter to insult you.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.940]   And also, as I said, it's very useful
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.620]   to know who doesn't like you.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.340]   It's useful for the so-called victim.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.620]   I think it's essential.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.460]   I wanna know who doesn't like me.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.940]   It's as important to me as knowing who likes me.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.380]   - But do you also believe in this open space of discourse
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.140]   that the insulter will eventually lose?
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.260]   - I think that's true.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.980]   I think the insulter eventually
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.800]   will wear out his or her welcome.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.340]   I do, but I like to know who the insulter is.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.300]   - 'Cause it gives you a deeper understanding
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.180]   of human nature.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.580]   - Yeah, and usually, by the way,
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.780]   my experience has been that the insulters
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.340]   have generally not been as smart
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.500]   as the people they've insulted.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.220]   And that's probably one of the reasons they insult them
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.700]   because they feel inferior.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.540]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.620]   - I mean, I'm not trying to be a psychoanalyst here,
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.140]   but a lot of the people who are the haters
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.600]   are pretty low down in the intellectual scale.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.240]   - Anyway, 95% of administration,
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.060]   you would fire, you're calling to fire 95%
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.500]   of the administration. - Correct.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.660]   - People should know.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.380]   I think people that don't really think about the structure,
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.180]   the way the universities work,
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.820]   are not familiar, I think,
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.620]   with the fact that administration,
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.100]   there's a huge bloat of administration.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.260]   You know, when you think about
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.460]   what makes a great university,
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.380]   it's about the students, it's about the faculty,
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.980]   it's about the people that do research,
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.500]   if it's a research university.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.440]   They don't think about the bureaucracy
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.940]   of meetings and committees and rules
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.140]   and paperwork and all that,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.740]   and all the people that are involved
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.300]   with pushing that kind of paper.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.060]   And there's a huge cost to that,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:55.100]   but it also slows down and suppresses
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.740]   the beautiful variety that makes the university great,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   which is the teaching, the student life,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.940]   the protests, the clubs,
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.740]   all the fun that you can have in a university,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.560]   all the varied kind of exploration,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.500]   which you can't really do once you graduate.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.340]   - Correct.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.540]   - It's the place, the university's a place
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   to really explore.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.660]   - In every single way.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.460]   So let me just talk about this important thing,
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.260]   because I'm very fortunate to have contacted you,
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.620]   almost by accident, in a very important moment in your life.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.620]   You're running for the Harvard Board of Overseers.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.580]   What is this board, how much power does it have,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.380]   and what would you do if elected?
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   - Okay, first of all, I have a prediction.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.220]   - Yes.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.140]   - That in about five years,
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.460]   they're gonna probably change the name
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.380]   because overseers reminds people of the slavery era.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.220]   - Yes.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.100]   - And we're in such a politically correct era now
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.980]   that the English language is being restricted,
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.140]   corrupted is the way I put it,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   because certain words are forbidden.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.340]   We have some problems in this country,
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   and I think part of the problem is the educational system
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.700]   has lost the sense of what academic freedom
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.300]   and free speech were all about.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.260]   And I think it's essential that the educational system
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.580]   begin to take more seriously
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.220]   what free speech and academic freedom really are.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.140]   That's why I'm running for the Harvard Board of Overseers.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   - So let me just linger on the role of the administration
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.540]   in protecting free speech.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.020]   So what often happens, I think you've written about this,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.180]   is there's going to be a few,
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.380]   maybe a small number of hypersensitive students
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.100]   and faculty that protest.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.980]   So how does Harvard administration resist the influence
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.980]   of those hypersensitive protesters in protecting speech
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.620]   and protecting even hate speech?
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.340]   - Harvard has done fairly well
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.780]   under the presidency of Lawrence Bacow.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   I have had a couple of meetings with Bacow.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.220]   I like Bacow.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.220]   I have donated to Harvard a print of my late wife,
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.380]   took a picture of Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.580]   when the Rolling Thunder Review got to Harvard Square,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.780]   and it's sort of an iconic photograph.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.940]   She called it the music lesson 'cause it's got Dylan
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   teaching Ginsberg how to play the guitar.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.980]   And I donated one of those to Harvard.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.020]   It's hanging in Bacow's office.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.700]   The new president, Claudine Gay,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.500]   is not known for respecting academic freedom
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.220]   and free speech.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.940]   People have said to me, "Well, give her a chance."
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.140]   Well, I'm willing to give her a chance,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   but she does have a record.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.060]   And she's a bureaucrat.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.780]   I don't think she believes in free speech
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.300]   and academic freedom.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.740]   I think she's a progressive, not a liberal.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:06.020]   I'm not happy with the appointment of Claudine Gay
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.780]   and it has made more essential my attempt
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.300]   to get on the Board of Overseers.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.820]   - So let's talk about the Board of Overseers
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.940]   and your run for it, the specifics, actually.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.940]   It would be nice because I think you're a write-in candidate
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.780]   and the election is over on May 16th.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.660]   - Yes.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.320]   - And I think there are specifics.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.180]   I'll probably give them in the intro.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.340]   I'll give links to people,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.500]   but the specifics are complicated.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   Let me just mention that you have to be Harvard alumni,
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.060]   so graduated from Harvard.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.300]   - You have to, in order to run and in order to vote.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.340]   - In order to vote.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.980]   And the process, I imagine, is not trivial,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   but this is done online and if you're an alumni,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.900]   you should have received an email
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.700]   from a particular email address,
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.500]   harvard@mgelectionservicescourt.com,
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.740]   and presumably there's a way to get some validation number
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.980]   from that email and then you go online,
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.340]   you enter that validation number and you vote.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.300]   And to vote for Harvey, you have to enter his name
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.620]   correctly, Harvey Silverglate, and spell it correctly.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:26.820]   Obviously, I'm imagining this because I'm MIT, not Harvard,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.780]   so I'm imagining the process is not trivial.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.940]   You have to click on things,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:35.940]   you have to follow instructions that are not trivial.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:41.940]   And I'll also provide an email if the process is painful,
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.900]   it doesn't work for you, that you can email.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.300]   Email harvard@mit.edu and so on.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.660]   I'll provide all the links.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.740]   But is there something else you can say
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.460]   about the voting process, what you're running on?
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.120]   - This is my second run.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.220]   The first time I got enough signatures to get on the ballot,
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:08.220]   then the Harvard Alumni Association sent out a letter
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:16.140]   to all living Harvard alums, recommending that they vote
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.660]   for the officially nominated candidates
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.780]   that excluded two petition candidates of whom I was one.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:31.260]   And I wrote to the Alumni Association and I said,
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.780]   "You have now sent out the curriculum VTIs
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.660]   and the policy positions
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.020]   of all the officially nominated candidates.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.380]   There are two petition candidates on the ballot.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   I would like to be able to send out my positions
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.660]   to the voters."
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.620]   They wrote me back saying, "Our policy is to only send out
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.820]   the policy positions and the platforms
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.580]   of officially nominated candidates.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.580]   Can you believe that?"
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.720]   Well, this is a liberal arts college, right?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.460]   Where from the clash of ideas, truth emerges.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.500]   Well, really?
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.940]   This is what I call Harvard's not so subtle means
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.860]   of candidate suppression, not voter suppression,
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.300]   candidate suppression.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.840]   And everybody can vote, but not everybody can run.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.740]   It ill becomes a liberal arts college
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.100]   where the clash of ideas will produce the truth.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.340]   Well, what about the clash of ideas
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.820]   on the board of overseers?
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.580]   The board of overseers is important.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.580]   It doesn't have the same power and authority
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.060]   as the Harvard Corporation,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.700]   the so-called president and fellows of Harvard College,
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.740]   but it's very influential and very important.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.460]   And it would be a great perch for me
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.900]   to try to exert influence for the university
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.360]   to get back to where it was
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.820]   before it was taken over by the administrators.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.220]   - Well, I'm pretty sure that most of Harvard alumni,
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.380]   most of the students currently going to Harvard,
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.700]   most of the faculty at Harvard probably stand behind
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.660]   the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.700]   - Yep.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.520]   - The people that love Harvard and what it stands for.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.820]   - See, the alumni were educated in an era
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.860]   where these concepts were taken more seriously
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.460]   and before the administrators took over.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   So I do think if I get my message out,
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.980]   I'm gonna win the seat.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.900]   And if I win the seat, I will have a great perch
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.300]   for trying to convince the real power that be,
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.440]   which is the Harvard Corporation,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.820]   to do the things that I'm suggesting.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.260]   Get rid of 95% of the administrators,
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.500]   get rid of the speech codes, reduce tuition by 40%.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.520]   All of these salutary benefits.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.380]   Can you imagine if Harvard became
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.940]   the most affordable college in the United States?
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.500]   - Well, the affordability is another aspect,
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.040]   but I think before that, just the freedom of expression,
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.060]   freedom of speech, freedom of thought
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.940]   at America's greatest universities,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.940]   I think is something that everybody would agree on.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.940]   It would have a tremendous effect on the whole country.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.740]   - And is there something to say about the details
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.740]   of how difficult it is for alumni to vote?
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.660]   You have experience with this?
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.140]   - You could vote online or you can vote by paper ballot.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.960]   You could request a paper ballot.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.900]   And all I could say is that the hard part
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.260]   is getting the message out.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.300]   My name doesn't appear on the ballot
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.060]   'cause I couldn't get enough signatures.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.260]   - Well, Harvey, Harvey Silverglate.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.300]   - S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.940]   You know, when my grandparents arrived from Russia,
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:08.300]   the name in Russian was something like Zilberglit.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.020]   And the immigration officer had several choices.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.300]   He could have said Silvergate.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.140]   Silver and gate are real English words.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.940]   He could have said Silverglade, G-L-A-D-E.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.320]   Those are real English words.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.380]   That's how my name is often dispelled,
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.140]   either Silvergate or Silverglade.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.540]   Silverglate is a nonsense syllable.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.820]   And why the immigration officer chose
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.440]   to transliterate Zilberglit as Silverglade,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.220]   I'll never understand.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.820]   And it is the cause of endless mistakes in my name.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.700]   - Well, the fundamental absurdity of life
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.580]   is also the source of its beauty.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.420]   - Yes.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.020]   - Anyway, we shall spell it out,
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:00.020]   and we shall get, yell loud and wide
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.740]   that everybody who has ever graduated from Harvard
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.420]   should vote for you if they believe in the ideals
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.900]   of the great American universities,
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.360]   which I think most people do.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.020]   - Let me also ask about diversity,
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.540]   inclusion, and equity programs.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:20.420]   You've had a few harsh words to say about those.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.780]   The idea of diversity, I think, is a beautiful idea.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.620]   You said that Harvard's idea of diversity
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.820]   is for everyone to look different and think alike.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.660]   - Correct.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.480]   - Can you elaborate?
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.020]   - And be comfortable.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.860]   - And be comfortable.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.700]   - Yeah.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.740]   First of all, it is impossible,
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.260]   if liberal arts education is taken seriously,
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.620]   it's impossible for students to feel comfortable.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.780]   Why?
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.460]   Because one of the roles of college
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.980]   is to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with,
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.660]   which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.580]   and by elementary school teachers.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:59.500]   And the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts,
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.580]   those ideas.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.740]   And if you don't have free speech and academic freedom,
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.260]   those views get reified.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.980]   They do not get challenged.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:14.860]   So it violates the fundamental role
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.780]   of higher educational institutions
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.840]   to have any restrictions at all.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.400]   That's number one.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.100]   Number two, as I think I said earlier,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.540]   if people, if students are not allowed
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.460]   to be frank with one another,
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.560]   they don't really learn about one another.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   And I've given a lot of lectures
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:45.100]   in which I said, and I think students now understand it,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.420]   I'm much more interested in hearing
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.340]   from the people who hate me than the people who love me.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.300]   I'm much more interested in knowing
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.900]   who disagrees with me than people who agree with me.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:01.220]   That's how I learn, and that's how they learn,
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.740]   the clash of ideas,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.100]   which is the theory behind the First Amendment.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:10.180]   That truth will somehow emerge, or if not truth,
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.060]   at least a better truth, a truer truth,
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.060]   a more useful truth, if ideas are allowed to clash.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.140]   - Especially in the structure of a university
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.220]   where, at least I would say there's some set of rules,
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.920]   some set of civility.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.340]   I think I would rather read Mein Kampf
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.480]   to understand people that hate.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.860]   There is also a quality to disagreement
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.180]   that we should strive for,
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.100]   and I think a university is a place
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.740]   where when disagreement and even hate is allowed,
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.640]   it's done in a high-effort way.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.940]   - You know, somebody asked me once
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.900]   about what books I would,
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.980]   what I have as required reading in literature courses,
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.900]   and I listed Mein Kampf, and they were horrified.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.980]   And I said, well, it's one of the most important books
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.200]   of the 20th century.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.380]   I mean, six million Jews died,
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.020]   an enormous number of other people died
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.420]   because one guy wrote a book called Mein Kampf
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.460]   and took it seriously.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.420]   It's one of the most important books ever written.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.820]   How can an educated person not have at least
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.540]   breezed through Mein Kampf?
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.220]   - It's not a great read, though.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.460]   - It's not a great read.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.500]   He was not a great writer, but you do get a sense
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.480]   for the sociopath that was Adolf Hitler.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.880]   - Yes, because he really acted on the words that he wrote.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.200]   - Yeah.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.440]   - And it was there, and if people took that work seriously--
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.280]   - Correct.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.760]   - They would have understood.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.320]   - It's one of the most important books of the 20th century,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.960]   and it's politically incorrect to read it.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.680]   It's crazy.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.320]   - But can you speak to the efforts
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.440]   to increase diversity in universities
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.880]   which I think is embodied in this D-I-E effort
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.160]   of diversity, inclusion, and equity programs?
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.080]   Where do they go right?
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.440]   Where do they go wrong?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.400]   - Okay, let me tell you, first of all,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.440]   this may surprise a lot of people.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.240]   I am opposed to affirmative action,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:21.600]   and I think that what it does
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   is it labels people by their race,
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.000]   by their religion, and by their national origin.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.720]   Precisely what we don't want people to do
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.560]   is be pigeonholed in those categories.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.520]   The reason that affirmative action has become
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.160]   the way that universities decide on who gets admitted
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   is because historically,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.880]   people in what's called marginalized groups,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.680]   blacks, gays, Hispanics,
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.460]   have been discriminated against in the admissions process.
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.520]   Now, what I have suggested
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.640]   is that instead of affirmative action,
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.360]   and by the way, here's a prediction.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.160]   The Supreme Court is going to abolish affirmative action.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.480]   There's a case pending, it's a Harvard case.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.660]   There are two cases joined together,
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.920]   one of a public university and one of a private university.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.700]   The private university is Harvard.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.260]   I predict that the Supreme Court will vote six to three
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.880]   to abolish affirmative action.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.700]   It is, on its face,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.340]   it is a violation of equal protection of the law.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.340]   Some groups are favored because of race or ethnicity.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:49.180]   It is a classic violation of equal protection clause.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.300]   When affirmative action was approved,
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.860]   the deciding vote was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.480]   She wrote a very famous opinion in which she said,
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.900]   "I hesitate to vote to keep up,
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.740]   "to affirm the notion of affirmative action
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.180]   "'cause it's such an obvious violation of equal protection,
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.120]   "but we have an urgent problem in the society.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.660]   "We are not educating our members
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.740]   "of racial and ethnic minorities,
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.520]   "and we have to try to get them into our colleges."
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.200]   So I think it should be approved for 25 years,
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:36.820]   and it should, in 25 years,
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.580]   it should have performed its role.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:44.100]   Well, it hasn't, and the 25 years is coming up.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.340]   I think it's three or four years left.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.240]   The Supreme Court is going to abolish it.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.700]   You can take my word for that.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.420]   'Cause it's such an obvious violation of equal protection.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.400]   Why did affirmative action come into play?
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.780]   Because the secondary and elementary schools are so bad.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.480]   Public secondary and elementary schools are so bad.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.620]   Why are they so bad?
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.380]   Partly because of the control of the teachers union,
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.020]   as Randy Weingarten runs the public school system
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.060]   in the United States.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   And what I have suggested is that the effort should be to,
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:29.820]   this is an emergency, it's a national emergency,
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   to improve the quality of elementary
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.560]   and secondary education.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.940]   And one way to do it is to hire teachers
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.660]   who are fabulous teachers,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.340]   rather than necessarily members of the union.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   I have come to oppose public workers unions.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:59.220]   I am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.900]   Why do I think there's such a difference between unions
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.820]   in the public sector and the private sector?
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:11.060]   In the private sector, management is arguing,
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.380]   bargaining with its own money
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.100]   and with the money of shareholders.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.560]   In the public sector, there's only one side.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.300]   There is the teachers union,
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.600]   and then there's a school committee
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.260]   that is dealing with the taxpayers' money, not their own.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:31.260]   And so it's a very skewed power balance.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.660]   So as supportive as I am of private sector unions,
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.380]   I am in opposition of public sector unions.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.340]   They're very destructive.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.020]   And I think without teachers union,
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.060]   teachers who are really skilled will be able to get jobs.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.420]   They would not have to worry about the seniority
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.100]   of teachers who long since have given up
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.840]   really creative teaching.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:02.240]   And we have to improve the public educational system.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.860]   I had, my late wife and I,
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.220]   had a classmate,
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.940]   we have a son who's now 44
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.140]   who went to the public schools in Cambridge.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.980]   He has a friend, first name Eugene,
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.860]   who was black kid from Roxbury,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.180]   whose mother understood that the schools in Roxbury
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.780]   were terrible, the schools in Cambridge were pretty good.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.460]   He lived in our house,
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.780]   Monday to Friday, and he went to school with Isaac
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.380]   in the Cambridge public schools.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.740]   Elsa and I would show up to school committee meetings
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.460]   when there was bargaining between the teachers union
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.800]   and the school committee.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.940]   The teachers union objected to our being there.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.180]   We argued we're taxpayers.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.580]   We have a kid in the school,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:03.160]   and we have his best friend lives with us
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.580]   and goes to school with him.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.460]   We have a real interest.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.740]   And the school committee walked out
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.580]   of the bargaining session.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.220]   The city council then reconsidered its vote,
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.260]   and they voted that citizens,
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.460]   taxpayers, parents of kids in the school
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.460]   could not show up to these negotiation sessions.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.000]   I thought that was absolutely outrageous.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   But I understood why, because these contracts are crazy.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.740]   No sane municipality should enter
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.340]   into some of these contracts.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.540]   And so I have become an opponent
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.940]   of the National Teachers Association,
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.780]   the Cambridge Teachers Association.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:01.180]   I don't think there should be unions for public employees,
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.420]   'cause there's no real bargaining going on.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.620]   And I think that the public school system
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:12.620]   will never be improved as long as the teachers are unionized.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.300]   - So that, to you, is at the core of the problem
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.300]   that results in the kind of inequality of opportunity
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.580]   that affirmative action is designed to solve.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.420]   - Correct.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.900]   If the educational system in the elementary
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.540]   and high school levels is improved,
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.700]   we wouldn't need affirmative action.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.500]   These kids would get good educations.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.820]   - So from all backgrounds, poor kids in the United States
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.820]   will get good education if public unions are abolished.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.120]   - Correct.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.860]   - And but do you--
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.540]   - And incidentally, the Postal Service
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.100]   would probably work better too.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.700]   - That's a whole other conversation.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.780]   But do you, at the core of the problem
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.980]   of the inequality in universities,
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.900]   that diversity, inclusion, and equity programs
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.140]   are trying to solve is the public education system
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.700]   of secondary education.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.620]   - Yes, correct.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.900]   Elementary and secondary.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   - Elementary and secondary education.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.660]   Well then, is there use, what is the benefit,
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.740]   what is the drawback of DIE,
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.700]   diversity, inclusion, and equity programs
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.300]   at universities like Harvard?
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.260]   - It's an affirmative action, basically.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.140]   And what it does is it allows the system
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.180]   of elementary and secondary education to be bad
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.280]   because they could say, oh, we got our kids into Harvard.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.140]   Yes, but you haven't educated them.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.780]   And it covers up the wound.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.260]   And I think we will never improve
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.260]   as long as we're able to cover up the wound.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.940]   And as I said, affirmative action is gonna be abolished
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.740]   by the Supreme Court.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.340]   It's a clear violation of equal protection,
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.740]   which is what's Sandra Day O'Connor understood,
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.540]   but ignored intentionally, but as an experiment.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.140]   And I believe it's gonna be abolished,
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:12.340]   and that's gonna force the elementary
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.300]   and high schools to get serious.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.300]   - Do you see the same issues that you discuss now
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.900]   at Harvard, at MIT?
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.420]   We're here in Boston, so I have to talk
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.620]   about the great universities here in Boston.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.380]   You've written about MIT.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.500]   I'm, it's a university I love.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.780]   I'm a research scientist there.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.460]   Do you see the same kind of issues there?
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.500]   - Yes, I do.
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.780]   - Do you remember, can you explain the case
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.380]   of Dorian Abbott Lecture that was canceled at MIT?
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.540]   - Yeah, well, you know, this is not the only,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.060]   it's not the only incident.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.460]   There have been incidents all around the country
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.180]   of academics, professors who have views
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.460]   that don't comport with the, as the great Lillian Hellman,
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.860]   another friend of my late wife, said they,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:04.060]   she said she refused to cut her garments
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.500]   in order to fit the fashions of the day.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   Dorian Abbott didn't cut his suit
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.380]   to fit the fashions of the day, his intellectual suit.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.580]   And so he was, this has happened at Princeton,
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:21.140]   this has happened at Harvard, this has happened at MIT.
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.380]   The great universities in the country have decided
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.340]   that the clash of ideas is not such a good idea
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.640]   because some people's feelings will be hurt.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.140]   Well, this is, there was quite a revolt against it.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.620]   Fire sounded the alarm.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.580]   And then in the end, the universities were,
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.580]   I believe Abbott was invited to come back.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.300]   I think he turned them down.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.580]   He shouldn't have turned them down, but he did.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:58.180]   And when the light is cast upon these situations,
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.100]   the universities back down 'cause they're so embarrassed.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.780]   And the newspapers, because newspapers depend
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.140]   on the First Amendment in order to exist,
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.340]   newspapers tend to give pretty good publicity
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.820]   to these cases of censorship.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.620]   - So they grill the universities.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.460]   - Yes.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.060]   - So they really emphasize, they catalyze the embarrassment.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:18.900]   - Yes.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:19.860]   - So is that one of the ways,
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.620]   is that the best way to fight all of this?
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.060]   - Yes, sunshine is the best disinfectant.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.660]   - You've written about MIT's connection to Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.500]   - Yes.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.200]   - He was well-connected at MIT and at Harvard.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:36.020]   What lessons do you draw about human nature,
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:39.460]   about universities, about all of this from this saga?
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.520]   - Let me say this.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.220]   I believe that universities, if somebody wants to,
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.180]   for example, donate to a university and donates
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.900]   on the requirement that the building be named after them,
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.020]   if the university is taking donations
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.820]   and the person is funding a building,
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.060]   and wants the building named after them,
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.280]   the building should be named after him, him, or them.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.240]   Harvard is facing this now with the Sackler building
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.580]   because the Sacklers have become now a persona non grata
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.580]   because of their role in producing the opioids
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:21.580]   that caused the huge scandalous opioid addiction.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.300]   There are people who want to remove the name Sackler
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.260]   from the Sackler Art Museum at Harvard.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:30.900]   Larry Bacow, the president of Harvard,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:35.620]   to his credit has refused to do that.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:42.100]   And if it reminds people that the money was earned
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.660]   through selling opioids, that's good.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.340]   That's good that people understand
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.200]   that that's where the Sacklers got their money.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.140]   They should be reminded.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:56.140]   In my undergraduate alma mater, Princeton,
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:57:00.740]   there's a movement to remove the name Woodrow Wilson
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.860]   because Woodrow Wilson was president of Princeton
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.780]   before he became governor of New Jersey,
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.020]   before he became president of the United States.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.660]   How he got to be governor of New Jersey
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.940]   was he was so insufferable that the trustees of Princeton
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.260]   got him the nomination to run for governor of New Jersey.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.820]   They had said, "We gotta get this guy out of here."
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:23.140]   And not 'cause he was anti-black and anti-Semitic
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.620]   as the trustees were as well,
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.980]   but because he just was insufferable.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:30.920]   He drove the faculty crazy and they got him out.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:36.980]   And so Princeton was thinking of changing the name.
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.780]   I wrote a letter to President Eisgruber at Princeton
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.880]   saying, "This is part of the university's history.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.760]   "You wanna rewrite history falsely?
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.540]   "Woodrow Wilson was the president of this institution.
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.460]   "He was one of your predecessors.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.160]   "He never answered me either."
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:59.900]   I think these people, they know they have no answer.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.780]   The reason I didn't get a response
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.820]   from President Eisgruber is the same as the reason
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.940]   I didn't get a response from the headmaster
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.500]   of Milton Academy.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.460]   They understand that what they're doing is violative
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.340]   of the fundamental precepts of academic institutions.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.580]   They're ashamed that they feel they have no choice
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.540]   because they feel that they would be criticized
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.300]   for racism, homophobia, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.260]   - Criticized by how many people?
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.900]   - Well, they feel that they would be criticized
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.820]   by students and parents and donors.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.900]   I disagree with that.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.260]   I actually think there are more people out there
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.020]   that agree with me than agree with them.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.460]   - Yeah, by a large margin.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:44.820]   - By a large margin in what I call the real world,
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.380]   which is the world outside the campus.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.700]   But academics are afraid they'd be criticized.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.180]   They're incredibly thin-skinned.
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.860]   When I say academics, I mean academic administrators.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.380]   They're very thin-skinned, politically correct,
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.760]   holier-than-thou.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.380]   As I said, I would fire 95% of them
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.660]   and I would be more careful in who I elected
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.820]   to lead these institutions.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.700]   I said, "Pulling gay is probably gonna be
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.980]   "a disaster at Harvard."
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.460]   - So it takes guts, it takes courage
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:20.460]   to be in the administration when the task
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.460]   of protecting the freedom of speech is there.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:27.460]   And also, which in part requires you to admit
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:31.300]   and to uphold the mistakes you have done in the past.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.140]   - Correct.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   - Not to hide them.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:33.980]   - Correct.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.980]   - And that to you, I mean, Jeffrey Epstein,
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.980]   for Harvard and for MIT, is a very recent mistake.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:42.820]   - Well, there's a debate whether it's a mistake.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.500]   They took money from him.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.340]   - Yes.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.380]   - Okay.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.800]   Is it a mistake to take money from bad people?
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:54.060]   Do you have to do a morals test of a potential donor?
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.500]   I don't think so.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.540]   - It's complicated because--
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.820]   - If there are no conditions attached to it,
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.860]   I think it's emotionally complicated.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.900]   I don't think that it is rationally complicated.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.380]   It's emotionally complicated.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.600]   It's particularly complicated if they want naming rights.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.420]   - Yes.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.260]   - You know, the Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory,
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.840]   that would be a problem for most universities.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:29.100]   I don't think that naming rights have to be given
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.860]   to somebody that you don't think is worthy
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.740]   of having their name.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.700]   I think the university has the right to say,
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.320]   "No, we'll take your money,
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.020]   "but we will not name the building after you."
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.060]   I think they have a right to do that.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.900]   - There's some degree in which you whitewash the name,
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.900]   though, if you, not with naming rights, but--
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.060]   - You take the money?
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.660]   - If you take the money, it allows the person
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.380]   in public discourse to say that they're collaborating,
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.540]   they're working together with Harvard and with MIT.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.220]   - Well, I have a problem with universities
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.340]   making morals tests of donors,
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.740]   because not every donor is as bad as Epstein,
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.340]   but some of the donors made their money in industry
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:18.340]   by being rapacious, by paying low wages,
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.380]   by exploiting people.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.500]   - You can make the case that accepting money
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.020]   from the Department of Defense, from DARPA,
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.820]   from the United States organizations
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.700]   that contributed to waging war
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.780]   and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.060]   over the past few decades.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.100]   - Correct.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.860]   - Folks like the tenured professor Noam Chomsky
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.380]   will make the case that that is far more evil
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.500]   than accepting money from Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.340]   - Yes.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.420]   - Still, Jeffrey Epstein is a known pedophile.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.260]   - Yes.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.740]   - So that's why I say I would not give him naming rights.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.700]   I think the university has the autonomy
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.200]   to not give naming rights,
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.260]   but I think that giving morals tests to donors
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.260]   is a Pandora's box.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.860]   - What do you think about the aftermath
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.460]   of the Jeffrey Epstein saga?
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.300]   It feels like, I'm not familiar with Harvard's response,
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   but MIT's response seemed to fire a few scapegoats,
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.500]   and it didn't seem like a genuine response
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:29.300]   to the evils that human beings are capable of,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.100]   sort of rising to the surface,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.380]   the description in a fully transparent way
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.100]   of all the interactions that happened with Jeffrey Epstein
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.440]   and what that means.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.380]   Yeah, what that means about the role of money
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.340]   in universities, what that means about just
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.580]   human beings in power.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.880]   - Money is essential to run a university.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.820]   One of the reasons it's essential is because
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.300]   the university is artificially,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.460]   artificially requires huge amounts of money,
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.140]   and that's partly because of the administrative army
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.180]   that they support.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.080]   And they would be less dependent
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.100]   on the Jeffrey Epsteins of the world
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.300]   if they didn't have,
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.900]   so it's sort of all part of the same circle.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.900]   - But there's a tension here.
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.820]   You're saying we shouldn't be putting a morals test
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.140]   on money, but actually if you make,
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.460]   if you expand the amount of money needed
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.500]   to run the university, you're going to make
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.660]   less and less, more and more unethical decisions
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.500]   in terms of accepting-- - Correct.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.420]   And since then, I am flexible enough to say
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.100]   that I don't think I would name a building
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.700]   after somebody who is truly evil.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.580]   I think the university has the right
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.840]   to limit the naming rights for a donor.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.920]   If I was an absolutist, I would not even say that.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.360]   I'm not an absolutist.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.020]   I have my limits, and that's one of them.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.720]   The Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory,
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.960]   it's a little bit much.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.080]   - It feels like there should be a requirement on,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.720]   there should be moral requirements
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.520]   on who to accept money from,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.440]   but the question is, the concern you have
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.040]   is about who gets to decide,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.840]   and what's the alternative?
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.360]   - Correct, I think there is no alternative.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.680]   I think that turning down donation
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.120]   because you don't approve of the conduct
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.980]   of the donor is a Pandora's box.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:37.840]   - But I'm just sickened by the fact
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.640]   that an evil human being was allowed to walk
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.720]   in the halls of a university I love.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.080]   So what do we do with that?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.760]   - Well, are you telling me
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.040]   that none of the students are evil?
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.040]   Are you telling me none of the faculty members are evil?
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.840]   Are you telling me none of the administrators are evil?
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.520]   - But that doesn't, sure, sure.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.440]   So scapegoating, saying that Jeffrey Epstein is evil
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.800]   can help us forget, can aid us in forgetting
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.760]   that there is other evil in the world,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.640]   and some of it might be roaming still,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.600]   the halls of MIT and Harvard.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.860]   - Hey, listen, I won't tell you the name,
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.200]   but I represented somebody in the MIT administration
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.400]   a few years ago who was charged
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.260]   with sexual improprieties against students.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.380]   And as a lawyer, I represented that person.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:34.120]   People said, "How could you represent?"
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.640]   Some of the people I represented, bad people.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.360]   Say, "How can you represent?"
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.880]   I said, "Well, if I was a cardiologist
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.840]   "and this person had a heart attack on the street
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.880]   "and I didn't deliver CPR,
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.660]   "I would have my license taken away."
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.000]   I'm a lawyer.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.880]   The only difference between my obligation
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.680]   and the doctor's obligation is the Constitution
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.840]   gives people the right to assistance of counsel.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.960]   They don't have, the Constitution says nothing
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.420]   about the assistance of cardiologists.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.580]   I have a very high duty to represent unpopular people.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:09.120]   Well, I think I apply the same test to the college donors.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.680]   The university should not have a morals test.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.340]   Who's money to take?
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:21.000]   I do draw a line about naming rights of buildings.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.760]   And I say that's an inconsistency with my absolutism.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.960]   But I just, emotionally, I just can't deal with having,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   you know, as I said,
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.360]   the Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.640]   - Well, for me, emotionally,
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.440]   there's nothing that sickens me more in the university
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.720]   than the abuse of power.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.640]   - Right, and there's an awful lot of people
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.560]   who abuse power at a university.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.960]   - And especially when it comes to abuse power of students.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.400]   So sexual harassment,
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.800]   so in the realm of sexual abuse of power,
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.720]   and all kinds of other abuses of power.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.440]   - Well, it is a crime to use one's power position
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.720]   in order to take sexual advantage of a student.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.640]   It's a crime.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.020]   This is not a close question.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.440]   - Yeah, but there's a legal crime
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.000]   and there's a deeply ethical crime,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.080]   and there's an emotional response that I have.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.240]   You are a good lawyer and perhaps a good man
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.360]   to want to defend some folks who are evil in this world.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.120]   I don't think I have that emotional fortitude.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.920]   - Well, then you shouldn't be a criminal defense lawyer
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.260]   or a cardiologist.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.360]   - I think you're right.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.400]   I'm still deeply sickened by Jeffrey Epstein
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   and the faculty, the administration,
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.080]   that still might be in these great American universities
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.400]   that are abusing their power in small ways and big ways.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.040]   But that's human nature.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.640]   You get a little bit of power
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.240]   and you're a bad man or a bad woman
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.560]   and you take advantage of it.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.440]   - Yep.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.960]   - We see that in the smallest of ways
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.240]   and in the biggest of ways
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.440]   in institutions and regimes all across the world.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.080]   (sighs)
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.160]   Boy, Harvey, it's a complicated situation.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.800]   - Well, it's a complicated world
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.320]   and it's complicated to be a human being
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.920]   and this is nothing new.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.040]   - And we should talk about it without restriction.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.440]   All right, just to linger on liberal arts,
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.800]   in 2014 and probably still today,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.560]   you wrote that liberals are killing the liberal arts.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.400]   - Yes.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.560]   - So can you explain?
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.220]   - Yes, the problem with, I'm a political liberal.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:35.360]   The problem with the political left
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   is that it has divided
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.780]   between what's called progressives and liberals.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:47.120]   Liberals are people of the left
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.040]   who believe in the First Amendment,
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.280]   an absolute First Amendment,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.040]   and in due process of law.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:00.000]   And the problem with what progressives now
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.880]   in the pursuit of equality,
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.840]   what they view as equality,
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.000]   they're willing to bend those rules.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.280]   And this movement actually started in Brandeis.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.880]   The critical, it's the critical race theory.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.920]   It started, Herbert Marcuse was a professor at Brandeis
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.500]   and he came up with this theory.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.360]   The theory was this, this is right out of Orwell.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.840]   In order to create true equality in a society
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.520]   where you have some downtrodden
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.940]   and some who are the uber-mention,
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:43.240]   in order to create real equality,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.080]   you have to reduce the rights of the upper classes
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.080]   and artificially increase the rights of the lower classes.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.920]   And that will produce,
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.280]   out of unequal treatment,
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.200]   true equality will be attained.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.720]   This is nonsense.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.360]   The idea of discrimination
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.900]   producing true equality is nonsense.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.740]   My view is, as I've said earlier in our discussion,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.740]   that the way to increase the opportunities
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   for the lower classes is to give them real educations.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.340]   And until we do that, it's not gonna happen.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.660]   And in order to do that,
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.660]   we have to overcome the problem of the teachers' unions
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.900]   at the elementary and secondary school levels.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.320]   Until we're willing to do that honestly
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.560]   and improve those schools,
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.800]   we're gonna have a problem of large number
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.360]   of uneducated people who need a boost
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.080]   because we haven't given them proper educations.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.760]   - What do you think about some
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.720]   of the more controversial faculty in the world?
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.000]   So an example, somebody I've spoken with many times
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.240]   on mic and offline is Jordan Peterson.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.880]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.720]   - Yes.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.000]   - But he is an outspoken critic
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.840]   of a proponent of free speech on campus
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.960]   and he's been attacked quite a bit.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.480]   He's a controversial figure.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.000]   What's the role of the university
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.200]   to protect the Jordan Petersons of the world?
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.000]   - I think the university has an absolute,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.400]   absolute, not relative, not border,
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.160]   that absolute role, obligation
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.440]   to protect the academic freedom
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.220]   of even the most controversial faculty members.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:48.200]   And you can imagine, out on a university campus,
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.960]   you have more people who are outliers
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.380]   than you do in the general population.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.980]   And--
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.820]   - That's the hope at least.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.340]   - Hopefully, yeah.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.240]   And those outliers have to be protected.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.500]   They can't be pressured, they can't be fired,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:11.500]   they can't be disabled from spewing their views,
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.020]   whether they're considered racist,
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.700]   whether they're considered to be,
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.420]   promote an idea of human society
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.220]   that's considered obnoxious.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.860]   It doesn't matter.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:28.040]   If you can't have freedom of thought
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.580]   on the college campuses, where can you?
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.180]   Them we're lost, as a society we're lost.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.680]   And as an educational institution,
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.080]   educational institutions no longer will educate,
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.060]   they will indoctrinate.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.140]   That we have to avoid at all costs.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.600]   - And we should also remember that the outlier
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.880]   might also be the only bearer of truth.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.380]   So in Nazi Germany speaking against the fascism,
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.620]   fascist regime, in communist Soviet Union
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.440]   speaking against communism,
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   they might hold the key to solving
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.600]   the ailments of that society.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.920]   - Absolutely.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.040]   And some of the most important discoveries
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   in science, for example, were mocked at the beginning.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.680]   I mean, think of poor Charlie Darwin.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   Charlie, I see he is on nickname levels with you.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.240]   Well, 'cause we're talking about these big topics
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.480]   of sexism, racism, and hate.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.400]   We should not forget about the smaller topics,
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.320]   which might even have the much bigger impact,
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.680]   which is what you're speaking to,
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   which is outlier ideas in science.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.120]   So basically welcoming controversial ideas in science.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.920]   And by controversial, I mean,
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.800]   just stuff that most of the community doesn't agree on.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.800]   It doesn't actually harm anyone at all.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.080]   But even then, there's always pressure.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.720]   One of the things I'm really concerned about
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.180]   is how little power young faculty have.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.080]   That there's a kind of hierarchy, seniority,
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.500]   that universities have, empowered by the administration.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.960]   Where the young faculty that come in,
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.840]   they're kind of--
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.760]   - Pre-tenure.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.080]   - Yeah, there's a process in chasing tenure
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.640]   where you're kind of supposed to behave.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.880]   And there's an incentive to kind of fit in
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.720]   and to not be an outcast.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.360]   And that's a really huge problem
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.360]   because oftentimes the youth is when the craziest,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.680]   the biggest ideas, the revolutionary ideas come.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.440]   And if you're forced to behave and fit in and not speak out,
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.760]   then even in the realm of science,
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.360]   the innovation is stifled.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.520]   - Well, now you trigger my,
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.960]   having to tell you this story.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.600]   - You're triggered, this is good.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.680]   - In the mid-1980s, I decided to take a four-month sabbatical
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.960]   for my law practice.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.200]   Professor James Vorenberg, who was at the time
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.360]   Dean of the Harvard Law School, heard about it.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.480]   Heard about it from his wife, Elizabeth "Betty" Vorenberg,
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.760]   whom I was very friendly with
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.960]   because we were both on the ACLU,
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.640]   the ACLU of Massachusetts Board at the time.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:17.680]   And so Betty told Jim that Harvey was taking a sabbatical.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.040]   Jim called Harvey and asked Harvey if he would like
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.720]   to teach a course at the Harvard Law School
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.440]   because there was nobody who had,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.960]   teaching criminal law from the perspective of somebody
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.920]   who actually was in court, litigated.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.200]   It was all theoretical.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.520]   I said, "Sure, I'll do it."
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.160]   So I taught a semester at Harvard Law School.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.440]   The student evaluations were fabulous.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.280]   Why?
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.200]   Because it was really interesting.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.240]   They were hearing a lawyer who was talking about real cases.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.960]   I actually brought in a few of my clients
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.920]   in some of the classes.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.600]   And so Jim called me and said,
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.200]   "Harvey, the students love this course.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.520]   "I'd like to offer you a tenure-track position
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.360]   "at the law school.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.720]   "You'd have to give up your law practice."
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.520]   I turned him down.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.240]   He said, "Did you just say no?"
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.600]   I said, "Yes, I said no."
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.560]   He said, "How come?"
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.360]   He says, "Nobody has ever, in my administration,
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.720]   "has ever turned down a tenure-track offer
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.600]   "at Harvard Law School."
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.000]   I said, "Because I could see that I'm not a good fit,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   "that the administrators overrun the place,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.920]   "that faculty members, especially untenured,
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.160]   "who are afraid to say things,
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.560]   "that might not help them in the tenure quest.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.320]   "It's not a good fit for me."
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.880]   You saw this in the mid-1980s already.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.680]   Yes, about 1985.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.880]   I went back to my law practice.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   I did not wanna get into this meat grinder that I saw.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.120]   Actually, I started to see it before the turn of the century
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.200]   'cause I co-authored "The Shadow University" in '98,
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.440]   and then co-founded FIRE in '99.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.820]   I'm an early student of this phenomenon.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.760]   - What are some other aspects of the book,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.520]   "The Shadow University," that we may have not covered?
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.440]   - Well, let me tell you a story.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.360]   I believe I tell it, "The Shadow University,"
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.680]   'cause it was part of-- - Go.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.480]   I'm loving these stories, Harvey.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.400]   - The stories are fabulous.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.120]   Let me tell you a story of,
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.700]   I did a tour of the country visiting campuses.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.520]   I visited a college called Hamline University.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.120]   I believe it was in Indiana or Illinois,
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.400]   somewhere in the Midwest.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.640]   And I attended a freshman orientation.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.800]   Now, listen to this.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.640]   This was a freshman orientation.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.280]   The administrators, the deans and the deanettes
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:03.720]   and the deputy assistant deans and deanettes,
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.520]   third deputy assistant deans and deanettes,
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.360]   lined the students up according to their skin hues.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.440]   - Oh, boy.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.200]   - The blonde, blue-eyed white folks were at one end.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.920]   The darkest, you know,
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:25.720]   African-Americans whose bloodlines had not yet
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.960]   mixed with any of the whites on the other end.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.200]   And the exercise was you had to tell
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.440]   how your race affected your success in life
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.740]   up until that point.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:44.840]   I thought it was the most demeaning thing
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.640]   that one could imagine, demeaning.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.240]   I thought to myself,
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.040]   they could do the same about sexual orientation.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   They could do the same about religion.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.080]   They could do the same about national origin.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.040]   It would be demeaning no matter what.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.920]   And the students actually verbalized
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.520]   how their race had either been a plus or a minus.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.360]   - They did.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.600]   - They did.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.320]   And I thought it was so demeaning,
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.640]   it just confirmed all of my distaste
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.320]   for this kind of approach.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.160]   - Let me ask you from the interviewer seat.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.400]   So I get to do this podcast,
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.520]   and I often have to think about giving a large platform
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:37.200]   and having a conversation with very controversial figures.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.760]   And the level of controversy has been slowly increasing.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   What's the role of this medium to you?
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.280]   This medium of speech between two people
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.160]   and me speaking with a controversial figure,
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.200]   me or some other interviewer.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.920]   What's the role of giving platform to controversial figures?
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.520]   Say members of the KKK or dictators,
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.800]   people who are seen as evil?
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.640]   - Well, we want to face the world with reality.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.520]   And the reality is that there are some unpleasantnesses
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.120]   in the world.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.640]   Running from genocide right through
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   to ordinary discrimination, to offensiveness.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.880]   It's the real world as we know it exists.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.400]   Are we afraid to say it?
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.920]   Do we want to make people think that we live in a world
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.000]   where those words are not used?
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.560]   Where those animosities don't exist?
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.200]   The answer is no.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.320]   - But you can whitewash,
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.000]   you can normalize the use of those words,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.800]   and you can whitewash the acceptability of certain leaders.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   So for example, interviewing Hitler in 1938, 1935, 1936,
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.040]   1937, '38, those are all different dynamics there.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.000]   But you can normalize this person,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.400]   and in so doing create enormous harm.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   - Well see, I don't see it as normalizing.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.600]   I see it as exposing.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.720]   If more people had taken Mankin seriously,
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.600]   Franklin Roosevelt would have acted much sooner.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.520]   He only got us into the war,
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.640]   as Congress gets into the war,
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.800]   when the Japanese made the mistake of attacking Pearl Harbor.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.840]   But there were some people in the State Department,
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.640]   there were some people in the administration
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.120]   who were trying to get Roosevelt
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.960]   to see what Hitler was really like,
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.040]   and he was blind to it.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.680]   And this was one of the greatest presidents
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.560]   the United States ever had.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.560]   He was blind to it until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:50.920]   So I think that words, unpleasant ideas,
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.720]   as expressed by Rhodes,
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   are essential for communicating fact and truth and reality.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.680]   And that's why I think that we should not
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.600]   whitewash language, we should not whitewash the fact
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.200]   that Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.040]   - And Harvard.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:10.880]   - And Harvard.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.320]   And reality actually means something.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.920]   - Yeah, but from the role of the interviewer,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.560]   that's something I have to think a lot about.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.440]   Whether interviewing Hitler, you said exposing.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.800]   I think it's hard to know what Hitler's like in a room,
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.080]   but it's also hard to know,
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.400]   I've never met Jeffrey Epstein,
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.720]   it's hard to know what Jeffrey Epstein's like in a room.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.160]   But I imagine to some degree they're charismatic figures.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.000]   So exposing them in the interview setting
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.920]   is not an easy task.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:49.160]   - Well, interviewing is not an easy job.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.440]   It's not a good idea to have an interviewer be an idiot.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.080]   (laughing)
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.440]   - I know exactly what you're saying
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.320]   and I know why you're looking at me directly as you say it.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.820]   I appreciate that, Harvey.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.600]   All right, let me ask about your friend,
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.360]   your colleague, Alan Dershowitz.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.240]   And I'll also ask about your review
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.480]   of his most recent book.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.400]   But before then, it'd be interesting
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.620]   to ask what you think of him as a human being, as a lawyer.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:24.040]   He's quite an interesting case.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.240]   He's represented some of the most
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.600]   controversial figures in history.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.800]   - Including Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.120]   - Including Jeffrey Epstein, Mike Tyson,
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.600]   Julian Assange, Jim Baker,
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.360]   and Jeffrey Epstein and even Donald Trump.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.080]   So he's an interesting figure.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.920]   What do you think about that?
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.040]   - Clarence Van Buelow.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.480]   - What do you think?
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.680]   What do you think about him as a human being,
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.680]   as a lawyer, what he represents
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.920]   in terms of values and ideals?
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.240]   - Well, he's a criminal defense lawyer.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.800]   And the job of a criminal defense lawyer
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.380]   is to represent accused criminals.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:01.100]   He is a lifelong Democrat.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.040]   He didn't represent Trump
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.200]   because he agrees with him politically.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.760]   - Voted for Hillary, I believe you wrote.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.780]   - He voted for Hillary, yes.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.600]   That's what he says and I absolutely believe it.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.780]   He's a liberal Democrat.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.960]   But he's a criminal defense lawyer as well as a professor.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   And I've represented some very nasty people in my career.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.040]   I wouldn't go out for coffee with them,
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.520]   but they have constitutional rights to representation.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.840]   - And you take that very seriously.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.840]   - Yes, you notice something that people
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.000]   don't understand about Dershowitz.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.600]   He was asked by Trump to represent him
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.960]   in the second impeachment as well.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.840]   He turned him down.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.600]   Why do you think he turned him down?
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600]   - So people should know he represented Trump
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.560]   in the first impeachment trial.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.000]   - He represented him only in the first.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.400]   And he was successful in when Trump was impeached
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.760]   the second time he asked Allen to represent him.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.520]   Allen has had a lifelong policy
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.480]   of only representing somebody once, never twice.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.880]   Why?
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.720]   Because he never wanted to be house counsel to the mafia.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:15.640]   And so he early on had this position.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.040]   He only represents somebody once.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.240]   The mafia wants a lawyer who's an in-house counsel
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.460]   who represents them in all their cases.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.080]   So that's the reason.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.960]   And Allen never publicly explained it.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.120]   I know it's a fact 'cause I've known him
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.040]   from the day that we met at Harvard Law School, 1964.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.080]   He was a first year professor.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.640]   I was a first year student.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.440]   We both had Brooklyn accents and we hit it off.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.520]   We've been close friends ever since.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.800]   - So there's some kind of unethical line that's crossed
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.320]   when you continuously represent a client.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.640]   - Yeah, he thought it was not so much an ethical line.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.280]   You have a right to represent mafia people.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.920]   But he didn't wanna be house counsel.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.120]   He didn't wanna be, you know,
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.640]   have them ask him for advice in advance
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.280]   of what they were doing.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.080]   He was willing to represent somebody once,
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.720]   no matter how awful.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.220]   Klaus von Bulow was accused of killing his wife.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:12.980]   These are pretty nasty people.
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:19.640]   But he didn't wanna be house counsel to any of them.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:24.120]   - So you wrote a review of Alan Dershowitz's new book
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.440]   on Donald Trump.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.240]   The title of that book is "Get Trump,
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.520]   "The Threat to Civil Liberties Due Process
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.320]   "and Our Constitutional Rule of Law."
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.200]   Can you summarize this book and your review of it?
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.800]   - Yes, by the way, I co-authored it
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.720]   with my research assistant, who's sitting right here.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.960]   - Emily. - Yes.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:47.360]   And I thought that the book was another example
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.840]   of the fact that everybody's entitled to a defense
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.120]   and that Alan's being involved with Trump
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.360]   was purely professional.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.560]   It was not political.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.140]   It was not philosophical.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.000]   And I thought that the fact that he was being criticized,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.280]   he was being shunned because of his connection to Trump,
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.840]   I found very interesting that this is a guy
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.840]   who represented such, I call them distasteful figures,
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:26.080]   as Klaus von Bulow, as Mike Tyson, as OJ Simpson,
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.400]   as Sheldon Siegel.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:39.320]   And when he was considered to be a skillful lawyer,
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.960]   made his reputation.
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:45.200]   And then he represents Donald Trump,
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.500]   who to my knowledge never killed anybody.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:52.480]   And he's suddenly shunned.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.280]   I thought the hypocrisy of it, the political preening,
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.760]   it was very distasteful to me.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:04.320]   And it was not only 'cause he was my friend.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.080]   If he wasn't my friend, I think I'd have the same view.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:13.720]   The holier-than-thou nonsense, the hypocrisy of it.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.160]   They wouldn't talk to him on Malthus Vian, though.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.640]   Alan and I are different.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.160]   I'm not so sensitive.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.080]   Someone doesn't wanna talk to me, no problem,
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.680]   no problem at all.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.960]   But Alan is, considering how controversial
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.440]   his life has been--
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.520]   - He's somewhat sensitive.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.640]   - He's somewhat sensitive.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.360]   And I'm telling Alan, Alan, don't let it get to you.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.280]   - I can relate, I can definitely relate.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.160]   Taking on some controversial conversations
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.960]   still wear my heart on my sleeve, it hurts.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.280]   All of it hurts.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.720]   But maybe the pain makes you a better student
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.080]   of human nature.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.460]   Maybe that's the case for him.
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.420]   Nevertheless, the book makes a complicated
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.100]   and I think an interesting point.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.420]   He opens the book with,
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.860]   "Now that Donald Trump has announced his candidacy
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.920]   "for re-election as president,
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.820]   "the unremitting efforts by his political opponents
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:13.300]   "to, quote, get him, to stop him from running,
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.340]   "at any cost, will only increase.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:18.160]   "These efforts may pose the most significant threat
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.580]   "to civil liberty since McCarthyism."
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:21.580]   So is he right?
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.180]   - He's absolutely right.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.780]   Because these attempted, for example,
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:30.300]   the prosecution, the one prosecution that has been brought,
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.960]   now Alvin Bragg in the Manhattan.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.860]   I have looked at that and I don't believe
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:37.980]   that Trump has committed a crime.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.660]   And yet Bragg was pressured to bring that.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.140]   People in his office were threatening
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.980]   to quit if he didn't indict.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.440]   Wholly improper, wholly unethical.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.540]   And he's gonna lose the case.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.140]   Has Trump committed crimes?
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.680]   Yes, mostly they're tax crimes.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:30:00.140]   He has cheated on taxes his whole career,
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.940]   as far as I could tell.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.860]   He could easily be indicted for state and federal taxes,
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.500]   but they're not as sexy.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:13.940]   And I think that he's become a target
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:20.340]   by ambitious politicians, ambitious prosecutors.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:24.460]   He has gotten some sympathy, which he doesn't deserve.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:28.220]   And a lot of it is, you'll pardon the phrase,
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.140]   political correctness.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:33.840]   The better people are not supposed to be Trumpers.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.980]   I had an interesting experience about Trump.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.340]   I had two interesting experiences.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.020]   The more recent one was I was in the house
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:49.020]   of Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard,
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.420]   who was driven out by political correctness, by the way.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.740]   He insulted women biologists.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:31:01.300]   I was in his house when he was still president of Harvard,
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:07.540]   when the Trump-Hillary Clinton contest took place.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:11.860]   And I was with Elsa.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:18.060]   We were invited to Summers' house in Brookline.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.780]   And it looked like Hillary was gonna win.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:25.480]   And the Harvard faculty members,
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.840]   they were all celebrating.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.480]   They were all figuring out what their cabinet positions
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.900]   were gonna be, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.860]   And then about 11.30 at night, all of a sudden,
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:37.980]   it was announced that in terms of electoral votes,
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:41.100]   Trump had just eked out a victory,
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.380]   that Hillary beat him in the popular vote,
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:48.060]   but he had won the electoral college.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.940]   And there was an immediate depression.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.540]   And that was--
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.500]   Meaning like a quiet over the room.
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.800]   The room became absolutely stone solid.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:05.460]   And they were all disappointed.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.500]   Well, that was a memorable moment.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:11.060]   And it told me that they were a little bit
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.420]   too overconfident.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:18.100]   They were savoring being part
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.140]   of a presidential administration.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.920]   Ambition had been thwarted.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.580]   I'm not a great fan of preening ambition.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.380]   I think it blinds people to realities.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.580]   And the resulting arrogance from such ambition.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.540]   And the arrogance, yes.
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.860]   It's one of the reasons I didn't accept
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:40.220]   Jim Vorenberg's offer to be part of the academic community.
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.580]   I mean, I represent professors,
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.900]   I have friends who are professors,
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.540]   I represent students, I have friends who are students.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:50.420]   And I have great regard for universities
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.820]   and higher education.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:55.580]   But I was not about to become part of the culture.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.780]   I thought that it was not good for me
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.620]   and not good for the institution either.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.900]   That can, a culture that can breed arrogance.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.720]   Yes.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.720]   Self-importance.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.180]   Yep.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.360]   And in a sense, the election of Donald Trump
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.420]   was a big F you to such--
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.260]   Correct.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.380]   Which is why I think he,
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:18.000]   why I think he managed to pull it off.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.820]   To jump topics a little bit,
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.900]   what do you think about something you've written about?
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.420]   What do you think about the mass surveillance programs
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:30.060]   by the NSA and also probably by other organizations,
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.340]   CIA, FBI, and others?
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:36.500]   And broadly, what do you think about
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.980]   the importance of privacy for the American citizen?
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.980]   Okay, I believe that the FBI should be abolished.
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:50.520]   'Cause I believe that its culture was so corrupted
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   by its first director, John Edgar Hoover,
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:00.260]   J. Edgar Hoover, that it is impossible
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:05.260]   to reform the FBI to make its agents honest,
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.660]   to force them to obey the Constitution,
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:13.400]   the first, fourth, and fifth amendments especially.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:19.120]   And it's a culture that cannot be changed.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.420]   Hoover established the culture
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:26.600]   and no FBI director since has been able to change it.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:32.720]   If you go online, I did on YouTube a video
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.700]   for the ACLU of Massachusetts.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.060]   It was when I was on the board.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.020]   It was probably when I was president of the board.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.220]   I was president of the board for two years.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.340]   I was on the board for 20 years.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:48.680]   And I did a video about advising people
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.940]   to never, ever, ever talk to an FBI agent
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.500]   when they come knocking on your door.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.500]   Can you briefly explain the intuition?
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.340]   Yes.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.180]   Why not to talk to an FBI agent?
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.340]   They have a system.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.140]   When they come in and interview you,
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:06.220]   two agents show up, never one.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.660]   One asks the question, the other one takes notes.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.940]   The note-taking agent takes notes
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.340]   and then goes back to the office
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:18.020]   and types up a report called a Form 302,
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:23.020]   which is the official record of what was asked and answered.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:30.240]   So when I have a client interviewed by the FBI,
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.240]   I show up and I always agree,
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.180]   almost always agree to the interview.
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.420]   But I bring a tape recorder.
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:45.040]   And I say, all right, I'm gonna tape this.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.460]   And they say, well, by regulation,
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.060]   we're not allowed to do the interview if it's taped.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:55.580]   The record is the 302, the agent is taking notes.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:58.860]   I say, well, I have a policy too.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.820]   My policy is to never allow a client to be interviewed
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.900]   unless it's recorded.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:05.540]   So it's unfortunate,
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.380]   but we're gonna have to end this meeting.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.200]   And the agents get up and leave.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:15.180]   And I've never seen a Form 302
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.540]   that I consider to be accurate.
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:22.540]   The agents write down what they wish you had said,
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:24.580]   rather than what you said.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:28.700]   It is a wholly corrupt organization
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.620]   that has not gotten any better since Hoover died.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:35.540]   - And fundamentally, the corruption is in the culture
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.700]   that is resisting the-- - Truth.
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.540]   - The Constitution of the United States.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.900]   - Correct. - The first and fourth
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.740]   and fifth amendment. - Correct.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:46.020]   It's not financial corruption.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.480]   It is corruption of the mission.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.380]   And I think it should be abolished.
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.820]   And if we need a federal investigative agency,
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.020]   it should be a new name, a new culture,
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:02.420]   wholly new members, a new director.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:07.420]   And it's impossible to reform the FBI.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:11.140]   - Can you elaborate on what exactly is broken about the FBI?
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:16.140]   Is it the famous saying from Stalin's KGB head,
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:20.660]   "Barry, show me the man and I'll show you the crime"?
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.500]   - Right.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.040]   - Is it that kind of process?
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.240]   - It's that kind of process.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.520]   They decide who's guilty,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.660]   and then they go about concocting a case
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.740]   against the person who they wanna get.
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:35.180]   - So the goal is not to find the truth or--
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.780]   - It's to solve the case and close it
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.220]   and enhance their reputations.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.860]   - But to show that an innocent man is guilty
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.960]   is also solving the case from their perspective.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.860]   So to falsely convict or falsely imprison an innocent man
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.540]   is also solving the case.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.980]   - Well, it closes the case
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:59.780]   if they falsely imprison an innocent man.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.340]   There is an enclosing cases.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:03.400]   - So that's the FBI,
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.160]   but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this,
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.980]   what are your views on the right
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.780]   that an American citizen has to privacy?
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:18.220]   - Well, wiretapping and electronic surveillance
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.240]   are very, very intrusive.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.220]   And I think that the circumstance
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.900]   that these tools are used should be narrowed.
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:33.900]   For example, they're used in a lot of drug cases.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.780]   Since I don't think drugs should be illegal in any event,
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.420]   I certainly think that it's a terrible violation of privacy
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:45.440]   to use wiretapping in a drug case.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.260]   I could see it in cases of murder,
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:55.260]   possibly in cases of serious extortion,
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:59.580]   but on other kinds of crimes,
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.020]   where they wiretap, especially drug cases.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.420]   I believe drugs should all be legalized anyway.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:06.800]   I think it's,
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:12.840]   the price we pay as a society is not worth it.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.180]   - There's on the Wikipedia page for "Nothing to Hide,"
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.460]   you're cited.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.940]   In fact, your book that you gave me today,
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:21.420]   "Three Felonies a Day," is cited.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.820]   So "Nothing to Hide" argument,
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:26.620]   that's an argument that if you're a well-behaved citizen,
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.660]   you have nothing to hide,
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:31.020]   and therefore your privacy can be violated.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.520]   - Well, the problem is that under the Federal Criminal Code,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.960]   particularly the Federal Criminal Code,
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:43.980]   it is very easy to be charged with a crime.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.820]   Now, why?
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:49.100]   Under the Constitution,
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.060]   the federal government does not have
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:54.180]   plenary criminal jurisdiction.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.440]   That's up to the state.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.860]   How is it that the feds indict
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.160]   in so many areas of American life?
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.860]   It's because the Supreme Court has allowed the following
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.960]   absolutely insane situation to prevail.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.540]   Anything can be made a federal crime
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:20.220]   if in the course of the commission of the crime,
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:26.620]   the means of interstate communication or travel are used.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:30.900]   That means that if you commit a crime,
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.100]   which ordinarily would be a state crime,
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:37.700]   and you use the telephone or you send a letter,
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.360]   it suddenly becomes federal.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.380]   That means that the limitation that the founding fathers
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:48.860]   who wrote the Constitution intended
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:52.820]   to keep the feds out of daily life
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.780]   and to give that jurisdiction to the state
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.180]   has been completely thwarted.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:03.540]   'Cause I can't think of a case
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.240]   where somebody doesn't use a telephone
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:09.940]   in the course of planning,
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.140]   discussing something that's arguably criminal.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.100]   And so this limited authority of the federal government
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:25.500]   to bring charges in criminal cases is illusory.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.380]   The feds can indict a ham sandwich.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.180]   So basically everybody's guilty.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:36.180]   And if the feds wanna bring you in, they can.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.700]   Correct. They can find a way.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:42.700]   And that allows them to terrorize people who are dissidents.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.540]   What is broken, what works
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.500]   about the American criminal justice system
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.140]   from your perspective from all--
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.180]   The jury system.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.020]   The jury system.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.840]   Yes.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.900]   You like the jury system.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:59.500]   Everyday citizens representing 12 ordinary people
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:04.120]   have to agree unanimously in order to convict.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.900]   What do you think about the highest court in the land,
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:08.860]   the Supreme Court?
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.140]   What works and what is broken
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.260]   about the Supreme Court as an institution?
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:13.940]   What are its strengths and weaknesses?
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.940]   Well, the Supreme Court is unfortunately fairly political.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:26.460]   And the current Supreme Court is overruling precedents
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:30.380]   which are, it's really improper.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:34.460]   And precedents should not be overruled so easily.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:40.780]   It's about to overrule the affirmative action.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.940]   Now, I'm opposed to affirmative action.
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.460]   I think I made that clear earlier in our discussion.
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.100]   But still, it's a precedent
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:53.020]   and it should be given some respect.
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:58.020]   But in order to propagate a more conservative agenda,
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:06.460]   the court is treating precedent
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:09.300]   as if it doesn't have any role.
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.740]   And that's a huge mistake.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:16.540]   Some of the congressmen on the Democratic side
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:19.040]   are looking to enlarge the court
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.540]   in order to basically do what Franklin Roosevelt
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.980]   was not able to do.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:30.900]   And that is change the court's philosophy.
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:34.340]   But I think that's very short-sighted
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:38.420]   because this is a long game.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.900]   This is a republic we have here.
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:45.100]   And anyone who tries to, for example,
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.340]   enlarge the court from nine to 12
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.900]   in order to get more liberals on the court,
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.660]   then some other administration will try to enlarge it
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:59.020]   from 12 to 15 to get more liberals on the court.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.820]   You'd have a constant fiddling
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.300]   with a very important institution.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.420]   - So the law should have more lasting power
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.380]   than the political bickering of the day.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.340]   - Correct.
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.340]   - Let me ask you, you've lived one heck of a life
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.340]   and fought a lot of battles
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:21.420]   and you continue to do so
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.700]   with the Harvard Board of Overseers.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.900]   So first of all, thank you for that.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.260]   But we're all human, we're all mortal.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.660]   Do you ponder your death?
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.940]   Do you ponder your mortality?
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.940]   Are you afraid of it?
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.260]   - Let me say this, my father died at 48.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.260]   He died at 48 because he smoked four packs of Camels a day.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:45.260]   He got a massive heart attack at 43.
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:48.940]   He continued to smoke despite that.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:49.780]   He died at 48.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.460]   So I did not expect to live this long
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.740]   'cause I thought it was genetic.
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:55.460]   It turns out it was cigarettes.
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:45:00.500]   So here I am, I'm gonna be 81 on May 10th.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.540]   I was born on May 10th, 1942,
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:05.060]   which is Mother's Day, coincidentally.
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:09.660]   And I realize I'm not gonna live forever.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:14.660]   I also take pride in the fact that I have demonstrated
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.500]   that a lawyer does not have to go with a law firm
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.620]   in order to manage to make it.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:22.220]   You can make your own, write your own,
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.180]   what's the word, write your own ticket.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:26.540]   I've done that.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.960]   I agree that I've had an elite education.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.860]   I went to Princeton and Harvard Law School.
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:36.680]   But I don't think you have to necessarily
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.000]   go to elite institutions in order to really make it.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.200]   You need to work hard.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.200]   But you shouldn't put yourself in a place
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.120]   where you're not gonna feel comfortable
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.960]   and what's the word, empowered.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.360]   Like I refused to take Javorenburg's invitation
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.420]   for a tenure track position at Harvard Law School.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.760]   (Mark sighs)
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.920]   I'll tell you one other story that illustrates this.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.840]   I was originally pre-med.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.500]   My freshman sophomore years at Princeton,
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.140]   I was in the pre-med program.
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:14.980]   Why?
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:20.500]   Because my parents wanted me to marry
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.680]   the daughter of our family physician.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:28.980]   And the idea was I was gonna go to medical school.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:30.980]   I was gonna go into medical practice
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:33.020]   with him in Hackensack, New Jersey.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:37.180]   We had moved from Brooklyn at the time.
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.380]   Long story why we had to move from Brooklyn
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:42.260]   had to do with my father's having a problem
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:44.960]   with the Furry's Union and having his life threatened.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.220]   And we moved to Maywood, New Jersey
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:51.500]   'cause he got a job in a fur shop in Passaic, New Jersey.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:55.940]   And a family physician, they had three daughters,
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.380]   the oldest of whom was my age.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.100]   She went to Hackensack High School.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.120]   I went to Pagoda High School.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.380]   They're both in North Brooklyn County.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:11.980]   And the idea was that she and I were gonna marry.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:14.740]   I was gonna become, I was gonna go to medical school.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:19.120]   I was going to become a partner of her father
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.080]   in his medical practice in Hackensack.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.160]   When he retired, I was gonna inherit the practice.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.780]   This scenario was concocted
[01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.840]   by Carolyn's mother and my mother.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:35.940]   In my sophomore year at Princeton,
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.100]   I won a fellowship to spend that summer,
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:42.060]   which would be my sophomore and junior year in Paris.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.460]   I was fluent by then.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:47.100]   I had taken an accelerated French course
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.700]   my freshman and sophomore year.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.480]   And I went to Paris.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.560]   It was my first time out of the country.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:02.360]   And I spent the entire summer working,
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.600]   supporting myself, participating in the airfare,
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.160]   and I earned money for room and board.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.040]   And I thought about my life, and I decided,
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.360]   number one, I didn't wanna be a physician.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.240]   I wanted to be a lawyer.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.160]   Number two, I didn't wanna marry Carolyn.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.640]   And I came back, I changed from pre-med to pre-law.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:32.240]   I broke up with Carolyn, who was by that time
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.000]   in school at Douglas, right down the road from Princeton.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.000]   She had followed me, or I had followed her.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.120]   And my life suddenly took a wholly different turn.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.080]   So that summer in Paris,
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.080]   Paris had a outsized effect on my life.
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:01.240]   Every year, the Brattle Theater shows "Casablanca,"
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.560]   where Bogart has this great line, he says,
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.320]   "We'll always have Paris."
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.320]   And I think to myself, I always used to say to Elsa,
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.760]   we used to see "Casablanca" every Valentine's Day,
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.280]   'cause it was such an important movie to me,
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.240]   'cause Paris was transformative in my life.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.120]   We went to Paris every year during my vacation,
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.000]   we went to Paris.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.480]   That was where she took some great pictures
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.240]   of Isaac, he's this high and this high,
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.140]   and they were hanging up in the house.
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:41.040]   And so I always, even after Elsa's death,
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.260]   I've seen "Casablanca" twice now.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.500]   She died in 2020.
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:52.800]   And I always think we'll always have Paris.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.300]   - We'll always have Paris.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:50:02.780]   Well, Harvey, like I said, I hope you're very successful
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.140]   in your run for the Harvard Board of Overseers.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.340]   I think what you stand for
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:11.260]   in the realm of freedom of speech
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:15.620]   is I think the thing that makes these universities
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.020]   great institutions in American culture.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:22.100]   And I'll do everything I can to help you succeed.
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:25.140]   And I just am really grateful for all the work you've done,
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:26.860]   and I'm grateful that you would talk with me today.
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:28.300]   This is amazing.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:29.740]   Thank you.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.260]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.300]   with Harvey Silverglate.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.460]   To support this podcast,
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:37.060]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:39.100]   And now let me leave you with some words
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.500]   from Harry S. Truman.
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.660]   Once a government is committed to the principle
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:46.180]   of silencing the voice of the opposition,
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.100]   it is only one way to go,
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.500]   and that is down the path
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.060]   of increasingly repressive measures
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:55.560]   until it becomes the source of terror to all its citizens
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.100]   and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:03.340]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
