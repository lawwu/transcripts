[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What are the top three to five sources
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.260]   of endocrine disruptors that we have agency over?
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.080]   And let's forget about pregnancy for the moment
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.560]   since we're all out of the womb if we're listening to this.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920]   Some people will be pregnant as they listen to it,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400]   but would you say it's, you know,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.240]   drinking out of plastic bottles?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.880]   Is it laundry detergent?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720]   Is it, you know, rubber tires that are cascading down on us
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.400]   through the air and we're inhaling them?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   I mean, presumably all of the above,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.840]   but which ones that we have agency over
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.320]   do you think are the most, let's just say,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.680]   concerning where people could make better choices?
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   - I would say foodborne exposures.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   Exposures in the food, in the food packaging,
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.200]   in the food storage, in the cooking utensils.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.480]   We can go through the various things,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   but we're doing that all the time.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.560]   We're eating all the time, we're getting food into us,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.920]   and these are bringing in a very, you know,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.480]   in a way that we have some control over,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.680]   some agency over, you know, we can make changes in our foods.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.240]   Very close to that is drink, you know, food and beverage.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.160]   Don't use any product with fragrance, for example.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.960]   That's a major source of exposure to phthalates.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.800]   - Any product.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.160]   - Any fragrance product.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   If fragrance is added-
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320]   - So no perfume, no lotions, soap with fragrance,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.920]   even essential oil fragrances like lavender.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640]   - Essential oil is a tricky-
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   - Right, it's a mix.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.560]   - It's a mix, yeah.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   So I'm gonna, that's guarded, but anything, you know-
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.760]   - Spray deodorants, roll-on deodorants.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   - Laundry detergent with-
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.600]   - Shampoo?
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.440]   - Yep, in shampoo.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400]   In any, if you can smell it,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.300]   it's probably affecting your hormones.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.440]   - I'm so happy about this answer.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.360]   Not because I have any stake in any company
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760]   related to fragrance-free stuff,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   but I have a very strong sense of smell,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.660]   and I either love or hate smells,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.320]   and I hate synthetic smells.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.840]   Like going through the duty-free,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.560]   especially in a European airport with all the perfumes,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.720]   and I'm just, "Oh, I'm gonna hold my breath."
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   It feels like I'm breathing poison.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.320]   - I know.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.840]   - Well-
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.760]   - Well, you are, actually.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.600]   - Yeah.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.420]   - Yeah.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.260]   - Yeah.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.100]   - In some sense.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.920]   - And most soaps, right.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.760]   - Yeah.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.600]   - Super interesting.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.960]   So that's your primary intervention,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   is to tell them to get rid of anything with fragrances.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.120]   - No, that's only one thing we get rid of.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   So then we talk about how the plastics
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.640]   that they use to store their food,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.420]   food storage containers,
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.840]   try to get them to get rid of those
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.240]   if they're made of plastic.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.520]   We try to get them to get rid of their nonstick pans
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   because of the PFAS chemicals that are in those,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.280]   and so on and so forth.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.480]   So we go through all steps of their life
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   and try to tell them how to make changes
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.180]   that will reduce their exposure.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.920]   - If somebody listening were having trouble conceiving
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.480]   for 12 months or more,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680]   are the sorts of replacement interventions,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.120]   product interventions that you're talking about here,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.160]   things that you would at least feel comfortable saying
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   might be a good place to start or to explore?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.120]   There's no harm.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.880]   None of the changes are putting people at risk
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.960]   or doing anything that could be harmful to them.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.040]   I'm sure of that.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.260]   We're very careful.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.900]   - And some are going to be cost-saving.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.740]   - Yes.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.480]   - And I think that's where like drinking
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.520]   out of plastic bottles far less, if at all.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   Just for reasons related to wanting to reduce waste,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.980]   I use a Mason jar or I use these or ceramic.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.760]   Although you'll probably tell me that the lining
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.400]   on the ceramic mug might have endocrine disruptors.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.240]   No, I don't.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.080]   Okay, great.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.360]   Okay, well then I'll keep drinking.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.980]   But it's very reassuring to me that there are things
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.160]   that we can do in terms of cost-saving elimination
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   or replacement of consumables.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.000]   - Buying in bulk.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.640]   - That can improve endocrine status,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.480]   maybe fertility also.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.000]   - If you can buy in bulk, bring a container to the store
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   and fill it up, a glass jar,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.920]   instead of buying something in plastic,
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.320]   you're winning on both ends
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.360]   because those bulk products are cheaper.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.260]   One of the things I did with the couples
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.580]   was go shop with them.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.940]   And we went around and we looked at various products.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.180]   And for example, we looked at the produce
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.700]   and there was the option to buy freestanding
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.340]   bunches of lettuce, heads of lettuce,
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.580]   or wrapped up in plastic bunches of lettuce.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.460]   And I said, let's compare the price.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.800]   I actually didn't know until we did it.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.660]   But that freestanding unwrapped lettuce was cheaper.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.520]   And I think that's, you know, because that makes sense
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.080]   'cause there's a work involved in wrapping it up
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.040]   and in the container and so on.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.960]   And so not only are you getting something that's more toxic,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.080]   but it's more expensive.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.480]   - When it comes to reducing BPA exposure
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   and some of these forever chemicals that you mentioned,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.280]   seems like reducing fluid intake from plastic vessels
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.720]   is gonna be number one.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.860]   The primary source of BPA is in the lining of cans.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.860]   So any drink or soup or anything that comes in a can
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.580]   is going to be--
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.060]   - Any can, all cans. - Any can.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   Unless it's a high end, you know, elite company
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.940]   that's made the change from BPA to an alternative lining.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.300]   And they'll say that.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   So, and by the way, BPA has some bad relatives
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.240]   such as BPS and BPF.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.600]   And maybe you'd be interested in this story.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.040]   So when it came out that BPA was estrogenic,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.080]   which is what it is.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   And by the way, it's kind of the evil twin of phthalates
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.480]   because phthalates are androgenic and BPA is estrogenic
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.320]   and phthalates make plastic soft and BPA makes plastic hard.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   You don't want either.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.180]   Okay, so when this came out that this was a bad thing,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.480]   the manufacturers started selling things that say BPA free.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.560]   I'm sure you've seen that.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.360]   The trick is that instead of BPA, they use BPS.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.920]   - Sneaky rats. - And BPF.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.400]   And these are chemicals, these are lookalikes,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.760]   they're analogs and they're just as harmful.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.480]   - Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.600]   I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it's just so dirty.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   It's so dirty.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.680]   It's like, you know, right now is a really important time
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.960]   to be having this discussion
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.680]   because there's been a lot of movement on Capitol Hill
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.560]   and there's been a lot of movement on social media
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.640]   about trying to call attention to metabolic syndromes
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.300]   and highly processed foods and issues like this.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.480]   And it's become unfortunately politicized.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.440]   I mean, I hear this stuff and I just think to myself,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.900]   the only good faith that we can really trust
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.160]   is our own desire to be healthier
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.420]   and to have our families and friends be healthier
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.500]   and to try and consume and not consume things
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.780]   on the basis of that.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.780]   My belief is that we can't trust any larger agency
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.180]   to either protect or harm us.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.020]   It's like, they're gonna do what they're gonna do.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.480]   We just have to be informed.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.460]   As opposed to trying to dismantle the systems
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.300]   that led to this,
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.400]   which just seems like infinitely complicated.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.840]   Maybe you can do that, but I'm far less optimistic.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.180]   And now that I'm 49 years old,
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.580]   I can say things like, now that I'm 49, I feel like...
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.500]   - But what you're saying is really important.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.820]   If I look at a can, it says BPA-free.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.660]   Doesn't mean anything.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.540]   It could have BPSs or other endocrine disruptors.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.380]   - Right.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.440]   - So drinking out of glass vessels,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.600]   drinking out of ceramic vessels.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.280]   - Metal.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.900]   - Metal, but not cans, not metal cans, not aluminum cans.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.120]   - Right, not cans, no.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.380]   - Goodness, okay.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.420]   - You know, you can get a metal water bottle.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.180]   It's not lined with BPA.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.460]   - Steel. - Steel, yeah.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.300]   - Steel.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.060]   - And is it true that microwave safe means,
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.820]   it just means that the plastic won't melt in the microwave,
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.660]   but it's-
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.800]   - You never, never put plastic in a microwave.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.080]   So here's the story.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   The BPA, phthalates, plasticizers are added to the plastic,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.020]   but they're not chemically bound to it, okay?
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.720]   So if you put anything in a container
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.520]   that has these chemicals in it,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   they will, and then put it in a hot environment,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.240]   they will come out of the plastic and go into the food.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.160]   So if you, in a microwave,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.920]   or you put your bottle in the car and the sun comes in,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.020]   it warms up the bottle,
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.960]   and then the stuff goes into your water.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.000]   You don't want to mix these chemicals and your food,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.240]   but if you do,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.840]   the worst thing is to do it in a heated environment.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.760]   - I think about all the food that was consumed in college
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.680]   in the '90s and 2000s,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.140]   like the cup of noodles with the styrofoam,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.980]   the, you know, things in packaging,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.320]   stuff like that is pretty straightforward to eliminate
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.120]   once one understands and decides.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.520]   Then we start getting into the more nuanced thing of like,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.880]   okay, you can buy a really nice tasting anyway,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.380]   grass-fed, grass-finished steak, but it's wrapped in plastic.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.760]   Well, or you can go to the butcher,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.360]   but most people don't have time to go to the butcher.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.000]   Or you can get strawberries at the farmer's market,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.200]   blueberries at the farmer's market,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.880]   which is what I try to do.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.920]   But sometimes I buy strawberries at the market
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.680]   and they have those plastic flip-top things.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   And of course I recycle the plastic.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.320]   How bad is it if, you know,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.640]   you rinse the strawberries off with good clean water
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.960]   that were in the plastic container?
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.920]   - We have to do that experiment, I don't know.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.760]   - Yeah.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.680]   - So I guess, so it sounds to me like
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.600]   not drinking out of cans, not drinking out of plastic bottles
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.680]   it's going to be not microwaving plastic ever.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.280]   And in general, just avoiding, avoiding plastic intake.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.960]   - If you can afford it, buy organic.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.320]   So you're going to avoid the pesticides
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.000]   and then phthalates are actually added to pesticides.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.920]   And they're added because they increase absorption.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.320]   So, you know, the, you want your pesticides
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.040]   to get into the plant, right?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.680]   And to kill the bad stuff and insects.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   And so the same property of phthalates
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.720]   that makes them good for pesticides
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   also makes them good for our hand cream.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.240]   Just mentioning, absorption, absorption.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.560]   Anything that's absorbed in the body
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   is going to have phthalates in it.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.160]   And it also holds scent and color.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.080]   So it's added to those scents
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.800]   and it's also added to your lipstick
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.360]   and to your colored, you know,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.440]   whatever you put on your face and so on.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.240]   Anything that holds scent and color,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.800]   that's going to be phthalates.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.960]   - I've been accused online of being a sunscreen truther.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.640]   I'm not a sunscreen truther.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.560]   I'm going to keep repeating this as many times as I can.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   I understand that UV damage to the skin
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.280]   can cause certain cancers.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.160]   I get that.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.260]   I agree with that.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.600]   The data are pretty clear to me
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.680]   based on having researched this pretty extensively
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.760]   and talked to many, many people,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.040]   including dermal oncologists,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.960]   that mineral-based sunscreens like zinc oxide
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.440]   and titanium dioxide,
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   but certainly zinc oxide
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.560]   are safer than the chemical sunscreens.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.240]   A lot of people get upset when I say that.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.200]   And they say, well, in Europe,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.080]   there's tons of evidence
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.880]   that the chemicals-based sunscreens are safe.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.720]   Okay, fine.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.540]   You use them.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.620]   I'm not going to.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.140]   The point being that UV damage is bad.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.180]   There are ways to protect ourselves from the sun,
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.460]   including physical barriers like clothing, hats, et cetera.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.800]   But pretty much all sunscreen that I'm aware of
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.420]   is designed to be absorbed.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.200]   So what do we do if we want to get some UV protection
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.720]   from whatever kind of sunscreen we deem safe for ourselves,
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.420]   but we want to avoid these exposures to these other things?
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.580]   What do we do?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.980]   Do we have to hunt really carefully
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.180]   for the right sunscreen?
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.420]   - Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.560]   Are you familiar with Environmental Working Group?
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.300]   - Is another one out of the Bay Area?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.140]   - No. - Oh, okay.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.500]   - I don't know actually where they are.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.340]   They're pretty big.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.940]   - Sounds familiar, but I can't say I'm familiar with them.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.900]   - They have consumer guides.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.220]   And in those consumer,
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.220]   so Environmental Working Group,
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.660]   I'm not part of them,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.740]   but I like their work.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.340]   And in these consumer guides,
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.720]   you can put in the product and they have categories.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.200]   You can put sunscreen.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.940]   If we had time, we could do it right now.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.820]   And then you can put the name of your sunscreen
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.160]   and it'll give you a number.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.540]   And then if the number is less than 10,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.600]   it'll tell you why.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
