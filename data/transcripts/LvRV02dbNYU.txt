[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.840]   All right, so what are we starting off with today?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.880]   All right, so we got a call.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   The first call is basically about the different types of people
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.600]   and how they go about planning.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.440]   My name is Johan van der Putte.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600]   I'm a Belgian psychologist.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.280]   And I've been thinking that there's probably a continuum.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.720]   At one end of it, you have people who are skilled at planning,
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.320]   or they have become skilled at it.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.360]   And then you have people who, a bit like me,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.040]   aren't so skilled at it.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.520]   I guess planning involves dividing up life into tasks
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.240]   and then allocating these tasks to pockets of time.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.480]   I guess it requires some special skill.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.000]   I think I'm not very good at it.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.920]   It is hard for me to do.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.440]   And it makes me sometimes stressed and a bit anxious
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.840]   when I try to do it.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.480]   You have any suggestions of how people who maybe aren't so
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.200]   talented at it, how they could move in this direction
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.560]   without attempting to become very good planners
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.720]   in the short time?
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.320]   Well, I think it's an important question.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.200]   And I am going to give you what I think
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.360]   of as planning baby steps, like a way
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.000]   to ease yourself into something that looks more like my time
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.480]   management philosophy.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.320]   And for those who are interested about that,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.880]   we did a core idea video about my time management philosophy
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.360]   that you can find at the YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.960]   YouTube page.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200]   You can find that core idea video on time management.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.520]   So I do have some baby steps to help you get into that.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   But let me just first emphasize that, yes, planning
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   is anxiety producing.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.000]   And that that shouldn't come across if this happens to you.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.080]   Should not come across as if there's something wrong.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   It's just the reality of planning
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.240]   is that it's anxiety producing.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.680]   And the reason is because you are confronting.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.880]   You are confronting this typically too large stack
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.160]   of things that you have been committed to doing.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.520]   You can't easily imagine how they're going to get done.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.400]   The planning centers of your brain
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640]   short circuit when they're faced with this type of overload
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.120]   scenario, that short circuiting causes anxiety.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.160]   I'm simplifying this.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.320]   There's a lot of other things going on.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.920]   But that's a simplified way of understanding what's happening.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.840]   So in particular, when you do weekly planning,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.120]   this is my experience.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.520]   When I am looking over all of my to-do lists,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.720]   when I'm looking over my calendar,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.320]   when I'm looking over my strategic plans,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.880]   and I'm trying to figure out what am I going to do this week,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.280]   I get very anxious.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.120]   It is a natural reaction.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   It's similar to having your heart rate increase
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   when you're running on a treadmill.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.240]   So don't fear that.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640]   Don't think that's a problem.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640]   That anxiety then fades once you're done planning.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360]   When you go day to day and do your daily time block planning,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.240]   if you follow my system, that's much less stressful.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.520]   Because now your weekly plan has already confronted
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.960]   the productivity dragon.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.440]   It's already confronted the short circuit inducing
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.560]   overload of tasks and come up with an idea for your week
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.640]   that makes sense.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.520]   And now you can just look at that idea for your week
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.820]   when you do your daily planning.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.680]   It should be less stressful.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.760]   So let's start with that.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.240]   What is supposed to cause anxiety?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.680]   Now what I'm going to suggest is for your baby steps
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   is essentially have low granularity plans,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.240]   plans that don't get into a lot of detail,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.040]   but are more structured than just what's next in my inbox,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.840]   what do I feel like doing next.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.880]   So if we're talking about daily planning,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.160]   I want you to do some time blocking.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.280]   This is when I'm working.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.900]   When I'm working, I want to have some say in advance about what
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.280]   I want to do with my time.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.680]   Get you out of the mindset of the list reactive method,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.040]   where you just react to things that come in and occasionally
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.200]   glance at to-do lists.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.880]   But to get started with time blocking,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   make your time blocks very large and quite generic.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.200]   Here are my meetings.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   Well, I might as well copy those down into my time block plan.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.620]   Let me take this big chunk of time
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.200]   here, not get too specific about it,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.760]   but just say catch up on email and small tasks.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   And let me just find one block in that day
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.520]   I'm going to say work on something specific.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.000]   All right, this is where I'm going to work on that report.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.800]   And any other time, you might just say whatever,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.880]   email and small tasks.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200]   So when you're starting off, you're
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.880]   really trying to have maybe one block each day where
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.040]   you specifically say, even though it's not on my calendar,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   even though no one's forcing me to do it,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.960]   even though I might want to do something else,
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.440]   I'm going to work on a long-term,
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.240]   cognitively demanding task during that time.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.000]   And the rest is by default, let's do shallows.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.640]   Let's do email.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.720]   Let's do tasks.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.360]   Then you might get a little bit better.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.780]   The way you get a little bit better
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.480]   is add in a focused admin block.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.020]   So you do this for a couple of weeks.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.160]   Now you say, this block right here,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   I'm going to go run those errands.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   I have an hour between this meeting and this meeting,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.860]   so I'm going to eat lunch, and then I'm
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.840]   going to swing by the drugstore and the bank.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   So now you're getting used to, let
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.360]   me be a little bit more conscientious about admin,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.200]   certain times being better for certain tasks.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.080]   And then just do that for a while.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.400]   I have a simple time block plan.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   There's one big block in there somewhere
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.080]   for focusing on something deeply.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.920]   There's one block in there for a specific type of admin task.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.560]   And everything else is like, whatever,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   list reactive, email, looking at to-do list.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.840]   You'll just get used to that after a while.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.160]   And then you can begin to add more granularity.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.920]   And I get into a lot of details about this.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.480]   In the front of my time block planner in particular,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   I actually have a chapter all about--
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.720]   there's like a book chapter at the front of my planner
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   that's just all about the mechanics of doing
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.400]   time blocking at a much higher level of detail
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.160]   and getting really good at it.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.120]   So you can find out about that planner at timeblockplanner.com.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.360]   And I really get into it, but that's how I would start.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.040]   And the same thing with your weekly plan.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.000]   Do a weekly plan, and feel the anxiety,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.440]   and trust that's going to go away.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.520]   But you can make that weekly plan kind of bad at first.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.480]   It's like, I'm looking at my calendar.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.640]   Let me just write down a few notes about this week.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.520]   I need to get started this week on this report that's
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.760]   doing two weeks because next week is
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.920]   busy or something like this.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.800]   Or Friday is going to be a good day for catching up
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   on something.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.440]   Just make a couple decisions.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.040]   And maybe have a reminder for some habits.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.760]   Like, don't do anything that complicated,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   but get in the habit of doing it.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.400]   And that's the main advice I'm going to give here
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.800]   is the binary from doing none of this planning
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   to doing some of this planning bad is the key binary.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.960]   That's the hard shift.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   I do a weekly plan.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.440]   I don't care if it's terrible.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   I do it.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.760]   I do a daily time block plan.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.880]   I don't care if it's pretty terrible.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.420]   There's only a few meaningful blocks.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.920]   I do it.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's the shift that matters.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   Going from that to doing those things well,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.880]   that'll come later.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.680]   It's not too hard.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.600]   You'll get used to it.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.560]   You'll feel that impulse.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.600]   Like, after you've done this for a while,
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.640]   it's like, well, I might as well make this better.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.720]   That's not a big deal.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.920]   It's going from zero to one.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.560]   That's the flip that's going to matter.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   And don't mind-- again, don't mind that anxiety
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.760]   around weekly plans.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.140]   That's just your brain doing what
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.440]   your brain is supposed to do.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.640]   So let's say--
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   I don't know how much I can talk about it, Jesse,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.920]   but we are deep in discussions about version 2.0 of my time
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.080]   block planner and what it's going to be like.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.400]   I have a lot of upgrades in mind.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.560]   Because as I told people, the time block planner,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.040]   you're not buying a single thing.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.200]   You're buying into a system.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.280]   Because you have to get new ones when it fills up.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.680]   And over time, it's going to keep improving.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.420]   And probably the longest cycle of improvement
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.840]   is this one we just went through,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   because we printed a bunch up front.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.280]   So it's like, OK, until we sell--
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.760]   we have to sell the ones we have before we do new ones.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.360]   And we've done that.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   So now we're working on the next one.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.680]   And as we print them in smaller batches,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.000]   making tweaks going forward will be cool.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.640]   So I can't talk about any specifics yet.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.680]   Because I got to tell you, in a global supply chain crisis
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.040]   moment, it's surprisingly hard to design new paper product
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.080]   type things, stuff you wouldn't even
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.420]   think about being potentially scarce, like glue can be.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.260]   So it's been a bit of a journey.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.580]   But I should have announcements to make soon
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.620]   about new and improved time block planners.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.660]   Exciting stuff.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.540]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.500]   (upbeat music)
