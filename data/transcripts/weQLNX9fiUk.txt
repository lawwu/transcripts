[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Someone asked how and why did you stay away from social media so long during the season?
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.940]   I just think like overall for me social media and like the day and age that we live in like the cons
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.760]   Outweigh the pros for me personally and probably a lot of dudes in general like it depends like what you want out of life
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160]   And what you're trying to reach for me
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.400]   I'm trying to you know
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.880]   Walk in my faith and I'm trying to be a man of integrity and and like grow
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.400]   And I just feel like social media is a hindrance to that first of all you see all this dope stuff going on you can
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   Get into like the comparison game or whatever, but then it's also like as a dude one of our struggles is females
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740]   And there's unlimited baddies on Instagram so like
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.400]   If I'm being a hundred percent like if you were trying to focus and stay away from like it could be a trap if that's your
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.800]   Thing so I just you got to be self-aware if that's your thing that you could fall into
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240]   You can remove it for a while and for me it helped me focus
