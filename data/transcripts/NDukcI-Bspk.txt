[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   "Spend your life to build a church that does not live like the world."
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.600]   This was the invitation of John Piper to Christian leaders at the Together for the Gospel conference
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.160]   back in 2008.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   This is what he said.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.560]   "I want to put it in a wider context for what my heart is for this moment and this conference.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.360]   I don't come here for nothing.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   I want something, I want you to do something.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.560]   I want this world to be rocked by your lives.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.200]   So I'll tell you what I'm praying, what I want to happen, and I think the brothers with
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680]   me would agree who lead this conference.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   My desire and prayer to God is that your life and your ministry would have a radical flavor,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:02.400]   a risk-taking flavor, a gutsy, counter-cultural, wartime flavor that makes average American
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.200]   people in your church uncomfortable.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.480]   A strange mixture of tenderness and toughness that keeps people a little bit off balance.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.440]   A pervasive summons to something more, something hazardous, something wonderful, a saltiness
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.640]   and a brightness about your life and about your church.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.320]   Something like Jesus.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.160]   When Jesus said, "You're the salt of the earth and you're the light of the world," I think
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.800]   He had in mind the verse just before.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.720]   They will persecute you and revile you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   on my account.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.560]   Rejoice, for great is your reward in heaven.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.320]   I think that's what makes salt.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.120]   Salt and light are joyful embrace of suffering.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.760]   That's what the world is waiting for.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.960]   Jesus said, "Do this.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.440]   Be light, be salt."
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.400]   My desire for you, my prayer, and I've been praying this over and over again for you,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.320]   I hope you already are ready, I hope you feel God doing this already in your life, my desire
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.200]   is that your life and ministry would have a radical flavor.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.560]   Reviling comes, persecution comes, slander comes, and you rejoice.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.680]   You don't murmur, you don't complain, you don't quit.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   You rejoice.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.240]   You preach and you live in such a way that over a decade or two or three, the church
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.560]   you're leading becomes bright and salty like this, counting it all joy when they are walking
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.000]   through various trials.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   That's your goal in this church.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:16.160]   Many people who meet cancer and meet death and meet suffering with unflinching confidence
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.240]   in Christ and joy in being known by Him and loved by Him.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.560]   There is a great reward coming, an all-satisfying, everlasting experience of the supremacy of
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.480]   Christ.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.240]   You will have lived it, right?
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   You're living this.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.160]   This is what you want for your life and I want for you.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.680]   You will have treasured Christ above all, above all the accumulation of stuff.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.480]   You will have laid up treasures in heaven and not on earth.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   Right?
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.520]   That's what you're doing now.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.280]   You're not laying up treasures on earth.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.920]   You are laying up treasures in heaven, you are maximizing your enjoyment of the reward.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:17.520]   You have not only fled fornication and adultery, you have fled opulence, you have fled ostentation,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.640]   you have fled riches.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.600]   You have remembered the story of the rich young man.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.440]   I have it on a plaque over the door in my study.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.520]   Remember the rich young man, Piper.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.480]   Whatever else you forget, don't forget him.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.520]   You remembered that as you served in these decades and will serve.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.200]   You've heard the Apostle Paul and you've taken it into your heart and you've blazed it on
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.240]   the brain in your head.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:03.520]   Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and hurtful
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.800]   desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin just to want to be rich does that
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   to you.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.920]   And you've heard that and you've put it on the inside of your brain and you've led a
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.600]   church another way.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.040]   That's what will make you salty and bright.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.000]   You have eaten the words of Isaiah.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.520]   All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.400]   The flower falls and the grass withers, but the word of the Lord abides forever.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.520]   You've put it inside your heart and that's where you live.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.080]   That's what you are thinking.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.440]   My desire and my prayer for you is that your life and your ministry will have a radical
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   flavor and I say this for the glory of Christ.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:19.920]   The world is not going to glorify Christ because they see that Christians are wealthy and healthy
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   and prosperous.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.560]   A very simple reason why.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.440]   That's what they live for.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.840]   So you use Jesus to get it?
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.560]   They use other means to get it?
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.040]   You're not impressed.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.360]   Jesus is the ticket.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.600]   When the show starts, you throw the ticket away.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.840]   They don't need your ticket.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.920]   They're not impressed.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.040]   I'm saying what I'm saying because I want them to be impressed.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.920]   They're not impressed with us.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:12.720]   Prosperous, wealthy, safe, middle class, do what everybody else does, people.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.040]   Don't build a church like that.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Don't go there.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.080]   Don't spend your life like that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.960]   It will be wasted.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.560]   You will have lived it.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.720]   My desire and prayer for you is that your life have a radical flavor.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:41.920]   Some extraordinary love, something risky, some crazy sacrifice that nobody can understand,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.540]   including mom.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.220]   Something salty and bright.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.380]   The world may not like it.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.640]   They may crucify it.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.000]   Satan's face shone like an angel.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.040]   His face shone like an angel.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.680]   They could not resist his wisdom and they killed him.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.080]   They weren't bored.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.200]   They weren't sleeping.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   And chapter 8 of Acts says he didn't die in vain.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.080]   He did his greatest work in spreading the gospel at that moment because God cleaned
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.560]   house in Jerusalem and saw to it that a persecution caused them to obey Acts 1.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   That's what it cost Stephen his life to get them off their butt into Samaria and into
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.000]   Judea and to the ends of the earth.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.120]   And it will cost you your life to build a church that doesn't live like the rest of
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.280]   the world.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.560]   You got to live like that.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:03.640]   You got to have a flavor about your life that is risky and radical, different.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.120]   That clip was from John Piper's conference message titled "How the Supremacy of Christ
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.920]   Creates Radical Christian Sacrifice" at the Together for the Gospel conference in Louisville,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Kentucky.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.040]   He preached it on April 17, 2008.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.200]   Special thanks to Jeff Connor of Neno, Wisconsin for suggesting this clip.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.800]   The full message audio can be found online at DesiringGod.org.

[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.360]   I know a few of our regular listeners are in fact wealthy by God's grace.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.160]   And if you want more on the missional value of affluence, see episode number 420 in this
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.240]   podcast series titled "Wartime Wisdom for the Wealthy."
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.680]   That's episode number 420 in this series.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.200]   What Jesus tells us to pray lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.480]   What exactly does that mean?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.160]   How does he deliver us from evil?
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.000]   Pastor John will offer his thoughts for us tomorrow.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.960]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
