[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   The wrong thing to do is to try and hide it or a lack of transparency, that that
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.920]   tends not to work out well.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.920]   An example that I heard was one kid found out that their father was extremely
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.840]   wealthy because they read about the newspaper.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   Best case, oh money's something to be embarrassed about, you know, worst case,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.680]   my dad's a liar and, you know, didn't tell me anything on this.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.560]   And so in reality, you know, your kids are smart.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.480]   They're going to pick up things.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.080]   They're going to understand how they stand.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.040]   And so by not having a pretty significant degree of transparency in age
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880]   appropriate open communication, it really just means that you're taking this topic
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   that you probably think is important and just abdicating the ability to teach them
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.440]   about it or the responsibility to teach them about it because you're sort of
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   pretending it doesn't exist, which, you know, maybe the best case in air quotes
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.720]   of what that looks like is when you pass away, they suddenly found out that they
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.320]   inherited hundreds of millions of dollars they didn't know existed.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.280]   That's not really a best case, but that's if you sort of managed to keep
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.240]   the secret the whole time, then otherwise they just, you're keeping
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.800]   secrets and you're not teaching.
