[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   On April 26th, 1998, John Piper preached a sermon on Romans 1 verse 1. It was sermon
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   number one in a new series he called Romans, the greatest letter ever written. He announced
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.640]   to his church it would be "a great ten years in Romans." He would go on to complete the
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.360]   book in 225 sermons in just 8 years and 8 months, finishing up on Christmas Eve 2006.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.160]   This Roman series is now legend, but back in the early months of the series, the church
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.960]   had to be prepared to plunge into Romans 118-320, a prolonged argument from Paul that diagnoses
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.240]   the world's sin problems and God's righteous, wrathful response to it. This section alone
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.360]   would require 22 of those sermons, and to prepare his congregation for such a heavy
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.480]   season ahead, Pastor John explained how hard texts about sin and wrath are vital for creating
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.480]   sages in a local church. Here's a clip of him explaining this from his August 30th,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.080]   1998 sermon titled "The Wrath of God Against Ungodliness and Unrighteousness." Here he
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.760]   is. For a couple of years, I've been throwing out from time to time a goal that I have for
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   the church in the word "sage." I want us to be, through Sunday school, Wednesday night
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.520]   efforts, track one TBI, small groups, preaching, worship, I want us to become a church in which
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:58.840]   we nurture and cultivate sages, sagacious people, that is, people who are wise, discerning,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:10.360]   penetrating, people-loving, heart-knowing, God-exalting sages. I've put it like this,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   all of you 20, 30, 40-year-old people should think, and I'm thinking of women and men,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.000]   I've said it especially to some of you women, some women wonder, "What's my vision for
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.200]   my life spiritually as I grow older?" Single, say, or married. And here's one vision,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.320]   here's one way to articulate to yourself why you're on planet earth. Think of becoming
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   a sixty-year-old sage
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.820]   to which hundreds of young women in their twenties
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.120]   and thirties and forties will come streaming
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.520]   because you penetrate. You see things.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.180]   You understand things. You grasp things. You know nature.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.520]   You know God. You know the heart. You know sin.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.020]   You know ugliness. You know beauty. You know wrath. You know holiness.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.320]   You know mercy. You know things. You've
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.820]   been into the human heart and worked around there
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.620]   and understood it and untangled the sanctity and the sin
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.920]   of the human nature and people read all over you the aroma of wisdom.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.320]   And I just think the only reason that doesn't happen more often than it does
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.020]   is that we don't pray toward it, think toward it, work toward it,
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.120]   read toward it, listen toward it, act toward it, relate toward it.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   We just coast. So,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.220]   long after I'm off the scene, may some people
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.420]   in this room right now be remembering. Remember twenty,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.720]   thirty years ago when Pastor John
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.820]   Piper was here and he called us to be sages?
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.520]   There's one. There's one. There's one. There's one.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.620]   The men and women in their sixties and seventies and eighties
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.320]   to whom people go because every time they go
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.520]   there's a fountain of life. The lips of wisdom
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.020]   are a fountain of life. Who drinks at your life?
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.520]   You are meant to be that. You are on the
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.320]   earth to become that way.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.220]   And so many of you have low views of what you're going to be
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.420]   when you're older. Stop having low views.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.220]   The Bible is written to make you wise
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   unto salvation and not just your own.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.620]   All of which is simply to tell you
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.020]   that to linger in the presence of an authoritative
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.720]   analysis of the human condition for some months
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320]   is not an unhelpful thing to do
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.820]   if you want to produce sagacious,
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.820]   wise, penetrating, loving
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.920]   counselors to whom people go
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.720]   and get great help.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.320]   Verse 18 of chapter 1, which begins this whole section on sin,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.220]   is given as a support for
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.820]   the gospel. You see the word "for"
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.220]   or "because" at the beginning of verse 18? If you have an NIV,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.820]   you don't see it because they dropped it. Shame on them.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.920]   Don't know why they do that sort of thing, but if you have an NASV or
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.420]   RSV or King James or one of the more
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.120]   literal renderings, you will see the word "for"
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.320]   or "because" at the beginning of verse 18, and it is
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.720]   absolutely essential
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.820]   for understanding the flow of the apostolic argument.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.820]   The gospel is power because
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.420]   in it righteousness is revealed
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.020]   for you to have by faith. God's not yours.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.220]   So that you can have peace in your conscience, acceptance with God, hope for
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.620]   everlasting life.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.620]   And you need that because
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.620]   the wrath of God is against your sin
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.220]   mightily. Get the connection?
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.420]   Which means that if you understand wrath and you understand
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.520]   sin and ungodliness and unrighteousness,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.220]   you will desperately look for the gospel.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.420]   You will want a shield
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.920]   from that wrath more than you want anything in the world.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.620]   And it's there in verse 17. We're coming back to it
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.120]   every Sunday. So if you wonder, "Are we going to leave the gospel behind
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.520]   and only talk about the problem for several months?" The answer is
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.320]   no. Because the only reason Paul talks about the problem
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.620]   is to make you love the gospel. And if you try
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.120]   to do an end run around this section and jump
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.620]   from 17 to 321,
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.020]   you won't love the gospel. That's being taught all over the world today
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   in the name of Christianity. Let's just jump over this sin stuff.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.020]   Let's just jump over this wrath stuff.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.120]   This is not encouraging. It is not going to make people want to come back to my
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   church on Sunday morning.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.320]   I don't believe that, by the way. Visitors, whoever you are,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.120]   frankly, I think you'd like an interpretation of
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.520]   death and suffering
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.020]   and moral degeneracy in our society. I think
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.420]   the world is kind of interested in where did that come from?
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.720]   And is there any hope to overcome it?
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.320]   I'm not worried about talking about sin and chasing anybody away.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.520]   People leave for all kinds of reasons. And people come for the most strange
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.720]   reasons you can ever imagine.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.120]   God brings you here this morning for this message.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.320]   You're here for this message. And I pray that you'll be
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:17.620]   listening. Because or for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.220]   ungodliness
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.220]   and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. The first thing I
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.720]   want you to see in that verse
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.420]   is the two uses of the word unrighteousness.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.720]   Twice, twice, wrath is coming against
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.020]   our unrighteousness. And we are holding down or suppressing or hindering the
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.820]   truth
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.920]   in unrighteousness. Surely, Paul,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   in writing those two words, unrighteousness,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.720]   means for us to connect them with the word righteousness in verse 17.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   And here that the reason we need
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.120]   a righteousness from God is because we
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.520]   are unrighteous. That's what he wants us to hear
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.720]   in these words. So don't miss that connection.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.520]   In other words, you can see right off the bat that the bad news of verse 18
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.620]   is meant to highlight the good news of verse 17.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.720]   And if you don't get your condition as unrighteous, you won't love
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.120]   the awesome reckoning
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.720]   of verse 17. So don't run from these things.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   Don't run from the diagnosis. Amen.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.320]   Do not run away from texts like Romans 118 to 320.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.520]   Slow down. Go through them deliberately. That clip was taken from John Piper's
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   sermon on Romans 118, preached on
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   August 30th, 1998. To find this sermon or the entire
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.620]   epic 225-part sermon series, you can Google it.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.820]   Just type in Romans, the greatest letter ever written.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.020]   Over the years, we've heard from many APJ listeners who have plowed through this
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.120]   entire series. Jonathan Stith wrote in to say this,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.320]   "Pastor John, your series in Romans was used supernaturally by the Holy Spirit
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.820]   and is the reason I am walking with the Lord today."
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.420]   Incredible. David Artrip wrote in, "Pastor John, your sermon series through
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.120]   Romans changed my life by opening my eyes to the deep truths of the gospel
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.420]   and God's sovereignty and goodness." Wow. The entire Romans series has been
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.320]   listened to by Jason Fest, Karen Featherston, Leonardo Diaz,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.020]   Stephan Tate, Jesse Pauland, Michael Fergus, Tony Gidwillow,
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.620]   Brent Stong, Annie Johnson, Scott Hewson, Dylan Rumbaugh,
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.220]   Hunter Manning, Mark Mabelline, and David Johnson.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.520]   And those are just a few of the APJ listeners who have emailed us to tell us
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.720]   about the experience. That's amazing. Thank you for sending your stories to us.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.920]   Well, it seems like every week we get emailed this question,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.620]   "How do I find a good local church?" Well, next time we're going to finally
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.820]   address the question. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Friday.
