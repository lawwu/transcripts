[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The second half of the thirteenth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   "In whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise."
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Now we are returning again to this great and vital and all-important subject,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   because regarding it as I do, as being of such supreme importance,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   it is vital that we should be in no misunderstanding or under no misapprehension with respect to it.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   We have first of all considered the actual statement which is made, the words.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We notice that we are told that after that ye believed, or having believed,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It's not something that happens automatically, the moment we believe.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It doesn't happen of necessity immediately.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It may happen almost exactly at the same time as conversion, but it may not.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   The two things are separate and are distinct.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I am not postulating that there must be a long interval,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   but I am saying that they do not happen at the same time,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and that the two things are separate and distinct.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We have also seen that this sealing with the Spirit is the fulfillment of a great promise.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We have traced the promises as they are described in the Old Testament
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and also by the preaching of John the Baptist and our Lord himself.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   This sealing with the Spirit is the fulfillment of a promise
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that had been made by God the Father throughout the centuries.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It is the promise of the Father,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   the thing to which these children of Israel had been looking forward,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   the thing which John the Baptist so emphasized.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   He said, "I indeed baptize you with water,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   but he, he somebody who is very lecherous,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   who shew I am unworthy to enloose,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This tremendous thing.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And yet, as we have seen, there is an interpretation of it
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   which would reduce it to something non-experimental,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   something of which we are not aware at all,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   nothing that comes into the realm of experience, we are told,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   doesn't affect the feelings at all.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It is an act of God whereby he secures us, but we are not aware of it.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Now, we were trying to show last Sunday morning
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   that surely that cannot be the true interpretation.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You cannot read the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   in which you have an account of the baptism with the Holy Ghost,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   the thing which our Lord had promised,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   as you find it recorded in Acts 1, verses 4 to 6.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You can't read that and still say that it's not experimental.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's the most profound and the most moving, the most exalting thing
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   that has ever happened in Christian experience or ever can happen.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Indeed, I reminded you last Sunday morning
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   that the great Dr. Thomas Goodwin of the 17th century didn't hesitate to say this.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   He said there is only one experience above and beyond the sealing of the Spirit,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and that is to be in heaven itself.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   There's nothing greater.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It is the greatest experience on earth, nothing beyond it but heaven itself.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So let us say we must emphasize with all our being this experimental aspect.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And we defined the essence of the experience as being this.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It is the peculiar, special, distinct assurance of salvation
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   which is given by the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You've got that perfect statement of it there in the 16th verse of the 8th chapter
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   of the Epistle to the Romans which we read at the beginning.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirits
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   that we are the children of God."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's what the sealing with the Spirit means.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It is that peculiar, unmistakable assurance,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   not something that you have to reason yourself into out of the Scriptures,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   not something that you deduce from the new life that is in you
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and the new inclinations over and above that.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   As Thomas Goodwin again put it, and John Wesley, you remember,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I read the quotations from them last Sunday morning at the end,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   they say it is something immediate, not immediate but immediate,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   something direct, not an audible voice,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   but a making sure of the promises of God beyond any doubt or peradventure,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   a kind of luminosity, the bringing of the word to us in such a way
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that God is telling us, "Thou art my beloved Son,"
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   as he said it to his own son.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We are that in him.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It is because we are in Christ.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It is in Christ that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit, with the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He is the sealer, and he seals us in that way.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Now, there is a sense in which I personally at any rate
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   am not concerned about the terminology.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   To me it's a very regrettable thing that some people seem to be so concerned
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   about the terminology that they fail to face the real question.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   The real question is this, "Do we know that we have been sealed by the Spirit?"
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The result of sealing with the Spirit is, as we have seen so clearly
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   from again that eighth chapter of Romans and the fourth chapter of Galatians,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   is that God has sent into our heart the Spirit of adoption,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   There is that within us which cries out unto God as Father.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Now, that doesn't mean that you accept the doctrine that God is your Father in Christ.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It includes that, but it goes beyond that.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It is the filial spirit God has sent forth into our hearts
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   because we are sons, the Spirit of sonship,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So that, my dear friends, I would suggest to you that the question
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   that ought to be uttermost in your minds is not a question of terminology,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   but the question of whether you have got the Spirit of adoption,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   whether you really are crying, "Abba, Father," from the depth of your hearts.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So that let's get out of the atmosphere of some mere superficial intellectual excitement
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and concern about terms and really face the content.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Terminology is finally irrelevant, although it is important.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   We should have ideas clearly in our minds,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   but it is the thing itself that matters.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Look again, I say, at the second chapter of Acts.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Look what happened to those Samaritans in chapter 8 of the Acts.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Look at what happened to Paul, having believed on the road to Damascus for three days.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   He was without this.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Then Ananias visits him, and then he receives this.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Look what happened to Cornelius and his family.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Look at those disciples in Ephesus in the 19th of Acts.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Read what the Apostle says here.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Listen to him asking the Galatians,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   "Did you receive the Holy Ghost by the hearing of faith or by the works of the law?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Which is it?"
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   "Now you know what happened to you," he seems to say.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   "How did it happen to you?"
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   That's the question.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Very well, then.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   We go on, therefore, with our description of this in order to bring this out still more clearly.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   The first result of a sealing with the Spirit is this immediate, direct, blessed assurance
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that we are the children of God, that we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That's the thing the Apostle is concerned about.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   He's writing about an inheritance which Jews and Gentiles have received in Christ.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We have made inheritors, partakers in the inheritance together.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And this is the sealing of it to us.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It means that clearly and nothing but that.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   But there are certain other results that happen at the same time, and here is one of them.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   In writing again to the Romans in the fifth chapter, in the fifth verse, the Apostle puts it like this.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He says, "Experience worketh hope," and then he goes on, "and hope maketh not ashamed."
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Because, he says, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You notice the expression?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's comparable to that term in the second chapter of Acts, "The Holy Ghost was poured forth."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's the same idea, exactly.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Not something vague and indefinite, but the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   so that we are, as it were, filled to overflowing with this love of God.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   The sealing of the Spirit leads to that.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So again, I say that that is the sort of question we've got to face.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Do we know anything about that?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Can we say that the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   This great love of God to us in Christ, here it is, it's been poured into us by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   That's a part of the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And of course, another result there for which it leads to is this.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Listen to the Apostle Peter writing to Christian people.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   He doesn't know them, he calls them strangers scattered abroad through various parts of the world.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And this is what he says to them, "Whom having not seen ye love.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   In whom, though now ye see him not yet believing,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   That's it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's the relationship of these people to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   They love him and they rejoice in him with a joy unspeakable.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He can't express it.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And full of glory.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Peter writes that, I say, about these Christians whose names he doesn't know,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   scattered abroad in various countries.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Now, that is, I understand, it is the teaching of the New Testament
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   with regard to this sealing of the Spirit.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That is the condition of one who has been sealed by the Spirit.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   He knows this, this is his reaction.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   This love of God is shed abroad in his heart.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And he loves Christ and rejoices in him in that way.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And then I ask a question.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Is there anything else?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   What about gifts?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   What about spiritual gifts, says someone?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   For it is obvious from the very chapter which I'm emphasizing,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   that those who were there sealed by the Spirit did receive certain gifts.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   They spoke with other tongues, you remember, we are told.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And there were certain other gifts.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Now, it is perfectly clear that at the very beginning,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   there on the day of Pentecost and subsequently,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   the sealing with the Spirit was accompanied by these gifts.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Read all those cases to which I've referred
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   and you will find that they did speak with tongues.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And that was the final proof to Peter and others
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that they truly had become Christian,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   that they had received the gift of the Holy Ghost
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and that therefore they must be baptized.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Very well.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Someone may well ask the question, does it therefore follow
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   that every time anyone is sealed with the Spirit
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   that such a person of necessity has these particular gifts?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Well, fortunately, we are given an answer to that question
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   in the twelfth chapter of the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   where the teaching is to this effect,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   that the Holy Spirit is the Lord of these gifts,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   that he is a sovereign Lord with respect to them,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and that he dispenses them and distributes them as he sees fit.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   To one he gives one gift, to another, another gift.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   They don't all have the same gifts,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   they don't all have any one particular gift.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Paul asks the question, do all speak in tongues?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   They don't.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Do all interpret? They don't.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Do all work miracles? No, they don't.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   The Holy Spirit gives one gift to one and one to another,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and there are many gifts.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He gives us illustrations of them,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   gift of wisdom, gift of help, understanding, and so on,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   various gifts which he enumerates.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   But the point of his teaching is this,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   that nothing is so fatal as to be coveting the certain particular gifts.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   There was trouble in the church of Corinth because of them.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   The whole church of Corinth was apparently divided up into groups and segments
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   because they were concerned about certain particular gifts.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Some of them were more spectacular than the others,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and the men who had the spectacular gifts despised the others,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   and those with the lesser gifts envied the ones with the greater gifts.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And Paul gives his great teaching concerning the church as a body.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But his point is that this question of gifts
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   is entirely the prerogative of the Holy Ghost.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   He can give gifts, he can withhold gifts,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   as he chooses and as he pleases.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And therefore it is very interesting to observe this,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   that when you come down and read the history of the Christian church,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   especially in terms of this doctrine of the sealing with the Holy Ghost,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   you will find this interesting thing,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   that these gifts which were given at the beginning
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   do not seem to have been given in subsequent ages of the Christian church.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I mean certain of them.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   There are certain gifts, on the other hand, which have been repeated.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Now, let me put it like this to you.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I read to you last Sunday morning the account given by a number of godly, saintly,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   remarkable men of God, of how they received this sealing with the Spirit.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I read you the case of George Whitefield.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I read the case of John Wesley, Jonathan Edwards,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   John Flavel the Puritan, D.L. Moody,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and I could have read you many, many more.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Now, there is an interesting question.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Take all those great men of God.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Not one of them ever spoke with tongues, not one.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But they had other gifts.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Some of them had the gift of understanding, the gift of teaching.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Whitefield had that unique gift of oratory,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   probably the greatest orator apart from anything else,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   quite apart from his message,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   the greatest orator that the world has ever known,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   probably apart from Dynastonians.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Now, that was a gift God gave to him,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and a special gift in preaching the gospel.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Different men of different gifts.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Wesley with his amazing gift of lucidity and of organizing, and so on.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   But not one of them had the gift of speaking with tongues,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   and they don't seem to have had the gift of miracles, and so on.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   But they had the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   God told them in this direct and immediate manner
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   that they were his children,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   that he had loved them with an everlasting love,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that he had chosen them in Christ.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   They were absolutely certain of it.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Wesley tells us, you remember,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   that there in Aldersgate Street, when his heart was strangely warmed,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   he knew that Christ had died for my sins, even for mine.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   He'd believed it before,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   but now he knows it with this direct and immediate certainty.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   So that it is important that we should differentiate
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   between the thing itself and the gifts that may or may not accompany it.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   The thing about the sealing with the Spirit is
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   that it seals the inheritance to us.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   That it is an assurance of sonship.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It is the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And it is tragic to notice
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   the way in which so many have been confused about this great matter,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   because of all that confusion about particular gifts.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   They're afraid even to consider it,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   because they know people who claim to have had this sealing with the Spirit,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   but who insist upon a particular gift.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And thus they are robbed of the blessing.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Well, now, I trust that it's quite plain and clear
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that you must not of necessity postulate gifts,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   particular gifts, with the sealing itself.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   There may be gifts, there may not be gifts.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   There is always some gift,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   but the thing itself is the blessed assurance,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   immediate and direct,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that we are the children of God.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Therefore, my dear friends,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I don't ask you whether you've spoken with tongues or not.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What I am asking you again is this.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Are you rejoicing in Jesus Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Is the spirit of adoption in you?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Why are you crying out, "Abba, Father"?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Have you got the direct certainty?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Has that been given you,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   that you are a child of God and an heir of eternal bliss?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   That's the question.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Now, it seems to me that it is in the light of this only
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   that we understand the meaning of a phrase
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   that was once used by our Lord,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   which has often perplexed people.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Do you remember how just before the cross
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   our Lord, speaking to the disciples, said this to them?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   "It is expedient for you that I go away,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   but if I go away, I will send him unto you."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   You will find that in the 16th of John, in the 7th verse.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Listen to these words.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Observe what he says.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   "Here is the Son of God standing amongst the disciples,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and saying to them,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   'Don't, let not your heart be troubled,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   don't be upset because I am going.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's actually a good thing for you that I should go.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Is that conceivable?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Here he is, the Son of God, with all knowledge,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and he was teaching them.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   He was always there to advise them,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   tell them what to do and what not to do.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He was able to give them power to preach and to cast out devils.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And as long as he is with them, they are happy and so on,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   but he is going, and he says,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   'It's a good thing for you that I should go.'"
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And it seems to me there is only one adequate explanation
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   or exposition of that,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and that is this sealing with the Spirit.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   The fact is that after Pentecost,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   these disciples were more certain of him
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   than they were when they were actually looking at him
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   with their naked eyes.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   They were more certain of him,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   they knew his doctrine better,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   they had a fuller understanding,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   they were filled with his own Spirit and with his love.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It was expedient for them,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   it was a good thing for them.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And you and I are meant to be in the same position.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   We are in a position in which it is better for us to be as we are
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   than if we were actually alive
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   when our Lord was here in the days of his flesh.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And the question is, are we?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Have we got that understanding?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Have we got that certain knowledge?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Have we got that love?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's the result of the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Well now, then, having put it like that,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   let me try to be still more explicit and clear
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   by raising a number of questions,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   which I know are in many people's minds
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and which are always raised when this doctrine is truly preached.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   May I say in passing in brackets
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   that what I am expounding to you is no new doctrine.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's a measure of the ignorance of modern evangelicalism
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   to regard this as new.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I've been trying to show you that this is the great doctrine
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   specially committed to the Puritans of the 17th century.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   John Wesley said many times that he did believe
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   that God had rarely raised up the Methodists
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   very largely to preach this very thing,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   this doctrine of assurance.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And you remember he believed it so intensely
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   that at first he tended to say
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   that if you haven't got it, you are not even a Christian at all.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   He modified that later on,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   but it was the peculiar doctrine,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   this blessed assurance of sonship,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   which is given by the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It is only, alas, since about the middle of the last century
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   that that other conception with regard to the sealing came in,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   which regards it as something outside the realm of consciousness
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and of experience.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Very well, then, let me raise some of the questions
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   to try and dissipate this confusion.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   The first question is, someone might ask,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   what is the relationship of the conversion experience
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to this sealing with the Spirit?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Because it may be argued that when a man is converted,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   he is given a rest of soul.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Now, what's the difference, someone may ask,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   between that and this sealing with the Spirit?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Because when a man has this rest of justification,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   he knows that his sins are forgiven.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He is given a sense of peace and of quiet.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Isn't that the same thing?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, the answer is no.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   The sealing with the Spirit goes well beyond that.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   The man who is justified by faith
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   is a man who believes the Word
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   and believes the teaching of the Word.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And he is given, as a result of that,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   this kind of rest and of satisfaction.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   But that may often be tested, and it may often be shaken,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and he will have to fly back to the Word,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   he'll have to fly back to other arguments.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Yes, and when he does so, he is again given his assurance.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   But he's always having to contend for it, as it were.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He still has to do it by faith.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   But the sealing with the Spirit is something so beyond that
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   that there's no longer argument.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You see, it is this direct assurance.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It is this Spirit bearing witness with our spirit.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   The man does nothing, but it's done to him.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It is God who seals us.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And we are aware of it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I was reading the other day a very beautiful illustration
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   to bring out this aspect of the truth,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   which was used by the saintly and the godly Richard Sibbes,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   another of those great Puritans of 300 years ago.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He used to preach here in London, in Lincoln's Inn.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And he was known as the Heavenly Dr. Sibbes.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Well, the Heavenly Dr. Sibbes used a little illustration like this.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   He said the difference between those two things can be put in this form.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   It's like a child who has been perhaps a little mischievous and disobedient,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and has got a sense of guilt and is unhappy,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and keeps on running back to his father.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And, well, the father just does receive him,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   but he doesn't smile much at him.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   He is reprimanding him, and he is punishing him in a way for his disobedience.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   But the child, by running back, gets a certain satisfaction
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   that he is with father after all.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And this goes on for some time, and they are walking on the road together.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And the child closes up to the father and touches him.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And the father goes on and just looks at him.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And then, after a while, the father takes hold of the child
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and lifts him up and fondles him in his arms
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and showers his love upon him.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   That's the difference.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Yes, without the sealing of the Spirit, you can know that your sins are forgiven.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   But not in this way.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   This goes beyond it.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   This is God, if I may so express it,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   enduring us and showering his love upon us, overwhelming us.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   You notice that that came in to all those experiences that I read to you.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   It was something overwhelming.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Even a man who had got the powerful physique of a D.L. Moody
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   felt that his body was cracking beneath it
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   when God did it to him and he cried out unto God to stop.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   He was afraid that it would actually kill him.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   That's what it means. That's the difference.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Very well, there's one question. Let me go on to another.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I've already hinted at it in passing, but it's so important that I return to it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's the relationship to sanctification.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Now, there are many people who have become confused about the sealing of the Spirit
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   because of this unfortunate confusion of it with sanctification.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It's so often been confused with this.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   You are familiar with the teaching that does so.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And there are some who say,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "Well, I've tended to avoid this whole doctrine of the sealing of the Spirit
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   because I've only known people who talk about eradication, mentioning it."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And they say, "I don't believe in that doctrine of eradication
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   because I could see that sin was not eradicated in them."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And there they are, they say, "I'd rather have been afraid of it all
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   because it's been put in connection with sanctification or eradication
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   or a clean heart or perfection or something like that."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Now, the reply to that is this.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   There is no direct connection between the sealing with the Spirit and sanctification.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   The Apostle Paul, in this section of the Epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   is not touching the doctrine of sanctification at all.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He hasn't come to that.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   All the Apostle is doing in this whole section from verse 1 to 14
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   is to tell us what God has done to us in Christ.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   He's showing us our position.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   He's later going to deal with sanctification.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   But here, he hasn't started with it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   He's not interested in it.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   What he's interested in at this point is our inheritance,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   our sonship, our relationship, the certainty of the ultimate arrival.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   So that, I say, to bring in sanctification here is to confuse counsel
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and to confuse our terms.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   It, therefore, I say, has no direct connection with the question of sanctification.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Paul says it is something that has happened to these people.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And, therefore, it is not something which is continuous as sanctification is continuous.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Now, I think that about two years ago,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   when I was preaching on the whole question of sanctification here on Sunday mornings,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I put the relationship between this experience of sealing and sanctification in this form.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   I said it is the relationship of showers of rain and sunshine
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   to the seed that has been planted in the earth.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Look at it like this.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   There is a farmer. He's ploughed his land.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   He's harrowed it, and then he's put in the seal,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   and then he's rolled it over, and then he leaves it.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And weeks go by, and you see nothing at all.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And you say, "Well, is there any seed there?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Was there any life in that seed?"
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Because you don't see anything.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Well, nothing happens at all.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It begins to appear above the surface, just sprouting and appearing.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And then it begins to grow just a little.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   You look at it day after day.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You say, "Well, surely the life has gone.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   This crop is dead. Nothing's going to happen."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   But then suddenly there's a wonderful shower and a burst of sunshine,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and you can almost visibly see that grain rising up, sprouting up,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and another comes, still more marvelous.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I suggest it's something like that.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   From the moment that man sowed the seed, the life was there, and the process had begun.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   The moment a man is born again, sanctification has already started.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Sanctification is not an experience to be received.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Sanctification is the working out of the life of God in the soul.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It starts from the moment of rebirth.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It's bound to.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   You can't have the life of God in you without its being active.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Ah, yes, but it may appear to be quiescent.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   But then this blessed experience is given, the shower and the sunshine.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And, of course, it has an effect upon one's sanctification.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   It isn't sanctification, but it has an effect upon it.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   The rain and the shower haven't got the life.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   The life's in the seed.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Yes, but they greatly promote it and stimulate it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   So does this experience.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   In other words, I can put it in this form.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Sealing with the Spirit promotes sanctification.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   It doesn't guarantee it of necessity.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   It isn't the same thing.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So that I'm going on to make this statement, which may surprise you.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It is possible for a man who has had this amazing experience of sealing with the Spirit
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   to become a terrible backslider.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   It's often happened.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   A man who'd been sealed with the Spirit, he falls back.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   He becomes a serious backslider.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   He still remembers what happened to him.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He can't get away from that.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   There are men who will tell you in their experiences that it was that alone that kept them sometimes
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   even from suicide.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Then they knew this, though all arguments seem to be against it.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   This was the thing that remained.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So, you see, it doesn't guarantee a continuance in a sanctified life, not at all.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   The poet Cowper, I think, helps us at this point.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   He says, "Where is the blessedness I knew when first I saw the Lord?"
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Where is that soul-refreshing view of Jesus and his Word?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He'd had it, but he'd lost it, as it were.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   But he'd had it and he'd never forget it, you see.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   It's something you can look back to.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   It is an experience.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   That's why I'm emphasizing this.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It was the thing that held poor Cowper when he was on the verge of lunacy.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   This sealing of the Spirit which God had given him and which God repeated to him in his mercy
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   and in his grace.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So there is the relationship of this experience to sanctification.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   We mustn't confuse it with sanctification.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   This has nothing to do with sanctification.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And my little booklet was about sanctification, not about sealing with the Spirit.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Christ, our sanctification, doesn't deal with sealing with the Spirit.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   It wasn't meant to.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It was meant to deal with sanctification and its argument is still valid and is still true.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   The two things must never be confused.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Well, let me go on to another question which is often asked and it's this.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   You read out to us, says someone, the experiences of those saintly men.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And you told us how John Fleville, during the best part of a day, didn't know where he was.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   He was so enjoying this visitation of God that he even forgot his wife and children in his ecstasy.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Are you saying, says someone, that we have not been sealed with the Spirit
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   until we've had some overwhelming experience like that?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Well, of course I'm not.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   The intensity of the experience may vary considerably.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   But, and let me emphasize the but,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I am saying this and the doctrine compels me to say it.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   This doctrine, this experience is unmistakable.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   The intensity may vary, as the intensity of any experience may vary.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Our appreciation of music varies.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   People may have an appreciation of music but it isn't always with the same intensity.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Our appreciation of beauty and of flowers isn't always the same.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I may like flowers but I may not be able to say,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   to me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that too often lie too deep for tears.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   I'm not a Wordsworth but I still appreciate beauty and flowers.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   The intensity may vary.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But God forbid that anybody should interpret that statement as meaning.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   If you are very well then, though I may be uncertain about this,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I can still claim it. No, you can't.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   It is certain. It is unmistakable.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   There's no question about that.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I have emphasized this repeatedly and I must say it again in this connection.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   If you're only having to persuade yourself about this thing, you don't know it.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It is of the essence of this thing that it is unmistakable,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   that it is given, that it is God telling us through the Spirit.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   The intensity may vary tremendously,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   but the thing itself is plain and clear and unmistakable.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I do trust that that is clear.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Let me go on then to another thing that follows directly from that.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   What about the factor of emotion?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   There are many people who are troubled about this.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   It seems to me that the modern Christian is more frightened of emotion than of anything else.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And of course they are frightened because they do not know the distinction between emotion and emotionalism.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And because they are afraid of emotionalism, they are afraid of emotion and they quell it.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And we've actually reached a stage in which people boast that in Christian experience there is no emotion.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   They are rather pleased today when people show no emotion at their conversion.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   No tears, they say. Marvellous. No emotion.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   You see how we can be led astray by confused thinking.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   There is all the difference in the world between emotion and emotionalism.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Is it conceivable that anybody can be told by God directly that he is God's child and feel nothing?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And feel no emotion?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   There was never a more stollied, unemotional man than John Wesley.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   He was a typical logician.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   A man who was not emotional by temperament and who distrusted it.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   But after what happened to him in Waldersgate Street and his heart was warm, John Wesley knew what it was to have a glorious emotion.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It is impossible to believe that God can speak thus to my soul and I am not moved to the very vitals of my being.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Yes, but someone says, what about all these excesses? What about all the fanaticism?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   What about all the phenomena? Are you asking for disorder? Aren't you tending to encourage disorder?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   They say, I read accounts of revivals. Revivals taking place recently.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I read a booklet which tells me this is that and I see strange phenomena and I don't like that sort of thing. I'm frightened.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Wait a minute, my friend.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   When God visits the soul, it is the most overwhelming experience that one can ever have.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And it is not surprising that sometimes the physical frame can't stand it.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I've reminded you of Moody who felt that even physically he was breaking down.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Well, it's not surprising that sometimes when the Spirit of God enters into people in such power, that for a while they really do lose their self-control.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   It doesn't trouble me at all.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   If you're in any difficulty about that, the best advice I can give you is to read a great book by Jonathan Edwards called
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   "The Religious Affections" on the nature of the religious affections.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Unfortunately it isn't in print but you can get it.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Jonathan Edwards, you see, passed through that great revival in Northampton in New England in 1735 and afterwards.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And there were strange phenomena and people were troubled about these.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   They said, is this a real work of the Spirit or is it a counterfeit?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And Jonathan Edwards has answered that question in that mighty volume.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I'm summarizing it to you by putting it like this.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   It is not at all surprising that when the Spirit of God thus enters into a man's soul in power,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   that unusual things should happen, that the balance of a man may be upset temporarily.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I'm not justifying that, I'm simply explaining it.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So I say don't be afraid of that.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And remember always that at such a time the devil is present and he is anxious to produce counterfeits.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   He turns people's attention to the phenomena and to the experiences and to the excitement.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And there are some poor people who simply look for ecstasy and for excitement and they get it.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And they get it from the devil. It has nothing to do with this.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Well what's the difference, says someone?
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Well there are certain tests that can always be applied.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   The true emotion produced by the Holy Ghost always leads to humility,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   always leads to reverence, always leads to a holy love of God.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Ah, men may sing, he may shout, he may dance, that doesn't persist.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   That's the temporary because of the weakness of the body.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   But what is permanent and what proves the reality is that the man is filled with a sense of awe.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   He's been near the majesty of God and is humbled.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   There is a humility.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   You remember that several of them told us in their experiences that they very rarely spoke about it.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   They didn't stand and boast. There was no boastfulness.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   No, no, the thing was too sacred almost to be mentioned, they say.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But there it is. It leads to humility.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And it leads to that love of God and that rejoicing in Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   It must do that because it is a revelation of this.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It's a seeing something of the height and the depth and the breadth and the length
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And it's impossible for anyone to have that
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   without at one and the same time being moved to the very vitals of one's being
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and yet humbled and having a sense of awe and of reverence and above all this love of God.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Well, let me summarize it in a word by putting it like this.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   No man ever knew more about this kind of thing than the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And you see how he's moved by it.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Paul was moved by a grand emotion.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   You can't read his letters if you're a Christian at all without being moved yourself.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Unless you've ever wept as you read some of them.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Unless you've ever felt like praising God.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Well, I say you must be ignorant of these things.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   The man was moved, the very name of Jesus Christ could move him and make him forget his argument
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and forget his own logic for a while.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He bursts out into a hymn of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And yet, you notice his constant humility, his self-depreciation, his self-abasement.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   You notice his burning passionate love.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   You notice his reverence, you notice the order.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   There it is in one and the same man.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   He was lifted up into the third heavens on one occasion and he didn't know where he was exactly.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   You know that's a part of it. These men all describe this.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And yet, here is the teaching, the incomparable teaching, and the balance, and the wisdom, and the understanding.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Oh, my dear friends, let us be careful, lest in our fear of some excitability and emotionalism
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and some strange enthusiasm and some odd phenomena.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Let's be very careful, lest in our fear of that we may be guilty of quenching the spirit
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   and thereby robbing ourselves and others of this wonderful blessing that God has for all his people.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Even yet, we haven't finished with it because I still have other questions which I postpone until next Sunday, God willing.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Somebody wants to ask if it's meant for all then.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Did all the first Christians have it? Should I seek it?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   God willing, I hope to deal with some of those questions next Sunday morning.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   But as I leave you, let me ask you again the same question.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Is there a spirit in you that cries out, "Abba, Father"?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Do you know, beyond argument, beyond having to convince yourself,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   that you are a child of God and a joint heir with Jesus Christ?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   That is the sealing of the spirit. Amen.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
