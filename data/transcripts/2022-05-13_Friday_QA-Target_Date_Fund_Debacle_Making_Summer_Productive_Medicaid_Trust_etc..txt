[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. Today
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   is Friday, May 13, 2022. And today, got the microphones all hooked up, we do live Q&A.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, each and every Friday when I can arrange the technology
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   to be in front of an internet connection and have a microphone and all of those useful
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   things, we do a live Q&A show. Works just like Call-In Talk Radio works, listeners call
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   in. You can talk about anything that you want. It's an open line Friday show. Ask any question

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   To join one of these Friday Q&A shows, to gain access to the codes and the times and
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   everything, you simply need to become a patron of the show. You can do that by going to
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance. Just search Patreon for Radical Personal Finance, you'll

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Q&A shows. That simply allows me to meter the number of callers so that usually we have
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   somewhere between four to eight callers instead of 40 to 80, which is obviously unsustainable.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And today we begin with, I forgot his name, was it Luke?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Luke: Yeah.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Luke, you're up. Welcome to the show.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Luke: Hey Joshua, thanks for taking my call. So my question involves an article that I
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   saw in January that Morningstar posted about Vanguard Lifecycle Fund. I had just seen that
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   a couple of people were, I think they were actually filing a class action lawsuit against
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Vanguard. They got an unexpected tax bill for some capital gains tax. I guess Vanguard
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   had quite a bit of redemptions and so they had to sell some of the assets in this lifecycle
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   fund and some people that held that lifecycle fund in a non-tax advantaged account ended
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   up with a significant tax bill at the end of the year from some capital gains. So I
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   was just curious your thoughts on holding a lifecycle fund like that in a non-tax advantaged
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   account. Is that a good idea or a bad idea or maybe some better option?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So let's just, the article here, I see a Wall Street Journal article from January 1, sorry,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   January 21, 2022 headlined the huge tax bills that came out of nowhere at Vanguard. A change
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that benefited big clients left little ones holding the bag. Let's read a couple paragraphs
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and make sure that we're on track here. It's easy for a small investor to make big mistakes.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It would be even easier for giant investment firms to help prevent them. But sadly, the
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   asset management industry seems to have other priorities. Just look at what happened last
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   month to some investors in Vanguard's target retirement funds. They got whacked with huge
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   capital gains distributions. Those payouts triggered painful tax bills they could easily
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   have avoided if Vanguard had simply warned them not to hold these funds outside of a
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   tax advantaged retirement account. Like many investment firms, Vanguard offers target date
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   funds, bundles of stocks, bonds, and cash that automatically become more conservative
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   as investors approach their retirement date. These funds are tailored for investors in
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   401ks or other retirement plans where taxes are deferred. So target funds aren't managed
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   to minimize dividends or capital gains. Hold them in a taxable account instead of a retirement
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   plan, and you will owe taxes on those payouts, sometimes much more than you would in other
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   types of funds. That shows the importance of what financial advisors call asset location.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   The choice of whether to put particular investments in a taxable or non-taxable account.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Most of the money in Vanguard's target funds comes from corporate and individual retirement
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   plans where funds gains and income aren't currently taxable. However, some investors
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   do not put non-retirement money into target date funds, and in December they got a nasty
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   surprise. Vanguard's target retirement 2035 and 2040 funds, for example, distributed approximately
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   15% of their total assets as capital gains, which are taxable outside of retirement accounts.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Fury erupted on bogleheads.org, a website popular among Vanguard investors. One investor
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   posted there, "I think I'm screwed by Vanguard resulting in an enormous tax bill. I feel
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   that Vanguard guided me down this path, which is frustrating." In the Bogleheads area on
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Reddit, another online forum, an investor posting as SittingHawk said he received about
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   $550,000 in distributions in Vanguard's target retirement 2035 fund, so he owes 23.8% in
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   federal tax and 4.95% in Illinois state tax. All told, more than $150,000. How, he asked
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   in capital letters, could Vanguard let this happen? So, here, it happened, a few paragraphs
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   down, it happened because big clients left little ones holding the bag. Vanguard's target
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   funds come in more than one format. Smaller clients get the standard version. Big customers
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   like corporate retirement plans get an institutional version with identical holdings at a lower
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   fee. At the end of 2020, Vanguard reduced the minimum investment in its institutional
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million. That set off an elephant stampede
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   as multi-million dollar corporate retirement plans got out of the standard target funds
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and into the institutional equivalents. Clients have to sell out of one format to buy the
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   other. Last year, assets at Vanguard's 2035 target funds shrank to $38 billion from $46
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   billion at year-end 2020. The 2040 fund shriveled to $29 billion from $36 billion. As big clients
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   left, their sales caused the funds to offload some holdings, triggering capital gains which
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   could be distributed only to the dwindling group of investors who stuck around. Some
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   had made the mistake of owning these funds in taxable accounts. Vanguard didn't have
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   anything to say about how it infuriated the individual investors who have taxable money
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   in these funds. Spokeswoman Carolyn Wegman said that because the target retirement approach
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   seeks to reduce risk over time by automatically trimming stock positions, these funds are
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   best served in a tax-deferred account. It goes on and says that it doesn't sell investors
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   that the funds aren't ideal for their taxable accounts, etc. So there's the background of
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   it, of what happened. It sounds to me like this was probably not really anticipated by
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   anyone from just reading that journal article. Is that your impression of it as well, Luke?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Yeah, that's the impression that I got. I've heard from multiple different financial advisors
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   in a few different places that a life cycle fund is a good place to put money, even if
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   it's not in a tax-advantaged account. So it seemed like I was not the only one that had
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   been given that advice, according to this article.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah. Well, generally speaking, life cycle funds do have a fairly high reputation, meaning
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   that people like them because they're simple. It's hard to screw them up. What life cycle
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   funds are designed to do is to follow the traditional advice of increasing your allocation
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   from stocks to bonds as you get older. In a world where there are so many wacky things
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   you can do and invest in that can bite investors, then we like, financial advisors and others,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   like to give simple solutions that work. It's hard to screw up a life cycle fund here. It
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   would seem to me that this was more of simply an unintended consequence from vanguards changing
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   their institutional account to allow smaller investors, instead of a $100 million minimum
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   have a $5 million minimum. So I would guess that this is just one of those risks that
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   is not really seen, not really understood in the beginning. Vanguard probably wasn't
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   paying much attention and I'm not sure what they could have done about it. So I'm not
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   an expert on it. Generally, yes, a life cycle fund is less tax-efficient than other forms
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   of standard index funds because they're continually selling stocks to move to bonds. And the bond
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   allocation inside of those funds can be relatively high, which can create current income and
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   dividends, etc. And so they're not as tax-efficient. That's why they're usually held in a retirement
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   account. I don't think this is a big problem one way or the other. This particular event,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   just from reading the one article that I've just quoted from, to me sounds like more of
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   a one-off event and something to be aware of rather than any kind of malicious intent
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   or any kind of scandal of any kind. That's the flavor that I get from this one article.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So would you have a recommendation for maybe a better way to... I'll give you a little
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   background. So my wife and I both have Roth IRAs. We both contribute to... it's their
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   savings fund. It's basically the government 401(k). And then on the side, we put a significant
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   amount of our money into just a taxable investment account that we're using to save up for when
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   we can move back to our home state and hopefully buy some land and a house. Do you have any
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   advice on the best... So I had asked... I talked to some people and they suggested for
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   that, for our homestead fund, we just put it into a life cycle fund. And put it in,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   not touch it, and then have access to it when we decide to move back. Do you have a better
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   suggestion? Is that a good idea? I just had read these articles and it made me a little
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   bit nervous after I had seen that.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   How long... what's your time frame as to when you anticipate moving to the homestead?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   On the short end, 10 years, probably more likely 15 to 20.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   How do you tell somebody whether they should paint their house beige or cream? That's the
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   problem here. There's nothing wrong with the advice. I can't say... I don't have an
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   argument as to argue why one is better than the other. For that type of application, a
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   life cycle fund can work. If you're trying to buy some kind of balanced fund that's going
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   to automatically move money from stocks to bonds, then that can be fine. And the tax
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   inefficiency of it would be something that you would need to pull up the prospectus,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   get a sense of what your actual tax bill could be, and adjust it yourself. And make that
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   calculation yourself. That advice that you've been given, I don't think it's wrong. I don't
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   have an alternative that I could argue is better. Basically, it's an argument between
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   should you... again, should you paint your house a cream color or an eggshell color?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Or it's like, well, it kind of gets you a similar result. All I can say is I have never
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   myself invested into a life cycle fund, nor have I ever recommended one. And my reasons
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   for that is I think that if you invest a little bit more time into becoming a more knowledgeable
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   investor, and you take more control of your money, that that will probably result in a
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   better outcome because you're more involved. And you can make the choice to say, I'm going
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   to go ahead and move from stocks to bonds with this amount of my portfolio myself. But
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   the life cycle fund is not wrong, it's just flavors of preference. And my preference
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   is to say... my preference generally is to say that I try to get people to be more aggressive
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   with their portfolios and own more stocks than bonds. And I seek to do that by encouraging
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   people to substitute the word volatility for the word risk. Because at its core, it's
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   the volatility of stocks that people need to be aware of, not necessarily the risk of
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   stocks. Stock investing is risky because stocks tend to be more volatile, as we see right
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   now, with a significantly volatile down market in the stock market. But at its core, I am
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   persuaded myself that there is a fundamental truth that owners make more money than lenders
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   over time. And so I want to be an owner of companies, not a lender to companies. And
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   as such, I want to own shares of the company, not lend money to companies. I believe that
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   owners make more money than lenders, even if there's more volatility. I also believe
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   myself, I am convinced that volatility is only one risk of investing. And the more significant
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   risk of investing, especially in the traditional retirement space, is the risk of running short
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   of money, the risk of underperforming inflation. That that risk is a bigger risk for many people
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   than is the risk of volatility. My third argument is that we can handle volatility very effectively
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   if we pay attention to timeline. And so we can handle volatility with personal financial
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   planning, having cash reserves, having a stable financial condition that allows us to have
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   reduced need for income at certain times. That allows us to wait out times of volatility
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   in the market. It allows us to not need to panic when things are down. And thus, we don't
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   need the same consistency that a bond portfolio provides, or at least we don't need as much
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   money in a bond portfolio. I'm not opposed to a balanced portfolio where that includes
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   bonds. I am opposed to have, I am opposed for most people to the idea of having 60%
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   of your money in bonds just because you happen to be 60 years old. And so for those reasons,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I'm biased against target date retirement funds because in my opinion, these are a bigger
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   risk for many retirement investors because they cause people to be too conservative in
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   their portfolio allocation, thus increasing the risk that they'll run out of money. Those
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   are my basic reasons why I'm opposed generally to target date retirement funds. While not
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   saying that they're wrong or that there's anything wrong or dangerous about them, they
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   have those risks that I've pointed out. Now in your situation, could it work? It could
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   work fine. But if you've got a time horizon of 20 years for a goal that is not a pressing
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   goal, then I'm going to have the same personal bias. I can't tell you the portfolio that
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   you should choose to it, choose for that. But if I've got a 10 to 20 year timeline,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   then to me, I want to be an owner of companies. And then I want to watch that carefully and
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   watch my timing and try to time the market as far as when I make those jumps out of being
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   an owner of a company to a holder of cash to meet my specific goals. And so my instinct
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   is that if you've got a 10 to 20 year timeline, that you're going to be better off if you
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   own more companies during that period. And then again, I'm using this terminology clearly.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And then you seek to time the market as to when your ownership of those companies gets
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   into a high profit swing or a high cycle in the stock market value, that that's the time
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   at which you say, "Oh look, I've got $500,000 over here in my equities portfolio and I can
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   buy the piece of land that I want for $500,000." Click sell on the stocks, buy the land, boom.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   But since you have a high degree of flexibility in that, I would be inclined myself to take
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   more volatility and focus more on owning companies rather than lending to companies. That's
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   why I'm biased against target rate date retirement funds myself. They're not wrong, but that's
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   why I'm biased against them.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Great. Yeah, that's perfect. That's just good to think about. I have heard similar
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   things from people just in terms of you don't have any control over how much of your portfolio
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   is allocated to bonds. I was kind of leaning that way. That's good confirmation. Thank
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   you.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Yeah, my pleasure. These are really hard questions to answer because for one person, the best,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   safest solution may very well be a target date retirement fund because it's so simple
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and it makes them feel confident and secure. That's great. And so it's very much a matter
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   of preference, taste, and nuance in this area. There's no clear and obvious answer at least
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   that I can give.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   All right, we go to 484 Area Code. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Hello.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Greetings. Welcome.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Hi. Nice to talk to you, Joshua. My wife and I were chatting about the summer coming up
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.560]   and our children and how we might, I was just thinking, what would Joshua Sheets would do
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.120]   to make an epic summer for his children and make sure that they're having a really productive
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:27.000]   summer, learning new skills, things like that. And I just didn't know if you had great ideas
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.400]   because you already do a lot of the homeschooling. I could see my kids playing outside, playing
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.560]   video games, doing some reading here and there, and doing a lot of family adventures. And
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:46.720]   at the end of the summer, maybe they didn't become better educated or have some new skills.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.120]   And I just wondered if I think language would be a great thing. And I think my son, who
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.320]   really does like video games a lot, he's very, very intelligent. I'd rather see him coding
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.720]   video games by the end of the summer because otherwise he'd spend time on Roblox if we
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   let him.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   How old are your children?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   Twelve is the son and ten is the daughter.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   Okay. So I love the question and I'll do my best to give you some of my ideas with
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.000]   the caveat that my children are younger and I'm still testing a lot of the ideas. And
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   I think that in this area, not a lot of this is, it's not right or wrong. It's just shades
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:35.400]   of application as a parent. As a parent, you need to trust yourself to respond to what's
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.600]   working and what's not working with regard to your children. So if you place a certain
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.960]   book in front of your children or a certain class and it doesn't work, you have to judge
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.760]   whether you want to pursue it and say, "No, you have to do it or not."
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.160]   And what are your children, what kind of school do your children do during the school year?
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.560]   They're in public school.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.200]   Okay. So just the standard government school. Okay, great. So here are a few thoughts that
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.880]   I have. Number one, in an ideal world, I don't see much of a reason, this does not apply
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.680]   to you, it's just a background as to why my answer is a little bit different. I don't
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.440]   see much of a reason to take summer breaks in the same way that we are conditioned to
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.560]   by what's around. It's my understanding that the concept of the summer break does actually
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:32.920]   have some roots in the need for children to be available to work, at least in the US,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.680]   the need for children to be available for summer labor on their farms at home. And then
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.120]   it just became kind of this cultural norm. And I think that the summer break, the way
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   that it's often done, is often not great. And I think if you talk to teachers, you hear
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.240]   this a lot as well, that a teacher finds that the last couple of weeks of the school year
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.280]   are often not so productive, and the first couple of weeks of the school year are often
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.880]   not so productive. You have to get the child caught back up from the summer lull. This
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.640]   is debated a bit, right? I'm part of the homeschool world, and so we debate this. Some people
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.000]   in the homeschool world talk very intensively about the value of having that summer break,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   some people don't. At the moment, in our family, we're not actively pursuing any kind of formalized
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.480]   summer break. Basically, we'd stick to our fairly standard school schedule unless we
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   have a reason to do something else. And so the reason to do something else is when we
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.240]   travel or when we have some special events, visitors, or we're visiting someone, or some
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.980]   special holidays that we're remembering. And I think that's effective because it keeps
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:46.680]   the consistency going, and it's better for learning outcomes. So I think that in a perfect
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:53.920]   world, I don't want my children to forget or to lose track of what they're doing. So
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:00.680]   I want, for example, the things that are languages, and by that I don't just mean English reading,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.960]   I mean the things that are just part of life, things like mathematics. I view mathematics
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.840]   as a language. Or things like foreign language, etc. Those things, I want them to continue
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:19.560]   year-round. And so if you feel like you can have a, if you feel like it wouldn't be counterproductive
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.840]   to your children, then I think that it's not wrong, especially if you have a two and a
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.720]   half or three month break, it's not wrong to require of your children that they do some
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:37.840]   amount of academics. Doing math year-round is a really good idea. Having some kind of
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.600]   break or having it broken up is, I think, a good idea. But requiring academics of your
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.120]   children during the summer, I think, is overall in their best interest. That may not be a
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   battle worth fighting if it is indeed a battle. So you, I'm not saying that's a must, but
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.840]   at its core, I think you can stave off a lot of the summer decline by just doing some basic
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:09.800]   progression. I think that this also can help with students who are not in the elite of
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:18.520]   academics. One of the challenges of your children being in kind of a standard cohort in the
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.760]   local government school is that the pace of the classes is not customized to the pace
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.800]   of the child. And so if you work with your child on an individual level, which is an
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.640]   opportunity that you have in the summertime, then you have the chance to make sure the
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.240]   child is really mastering things. The biggest mistake, the biggest regret that I have, and
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:47.520]   this has affected what I do with my own children as far as their formal studies, is that when
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.480]   I was with a cohort, a lot of times I didn't do enough work to be really confident. I think
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.720]   here especially of math. I was an okay math student, but I wasn't a great math student.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:03.640]   I got A's and B's, but I never mastered the material. I got a two on my AP calculus exam
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:09.560]   because I never mastered the material. Now when I look back, what I realize is if my
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.640]   parents had simply figured out that I wasn't doing enough practice problems and they had
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:22.040]   required more practice problems of me in the time when I had more time, then I would have
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.080]   been a better student by simply doing more practice problems. Now again, would I have
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.000]   resisted? Probably. Should they have pushed through that resistance? Today I would thank
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.880]   them if they had pushed through that resistance. When I think back on the battles that I fought
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:44.620]   with my parents, I regret the times that I won by getting them to capitulate and keep
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.380]   me from doing something. I wish that they had been a little bit tougher on me and required
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:55.880]   more of me. That's my own perspective. So what does that mean? Well, if you assess where
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.720]   your child is doing well and where your child is not doing well, and use the summertime
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.640]   to shore up some of the academics where your child is not doing so well. Summer school
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.240]   exists for a reason. While you might not want your child to go to summer school, you can
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.480]   make sure that your child has some schooling during the summer even at home. That may be
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:24.560]   too hard for you to do since you're kind of on the standard school schedule, but it's
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.040]   worth considering. The next thing is, I think at 12 years old, you're starting to make the
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:39.000]   pivot to thinking about high school stuff. And so I think a good look at your outline
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.080]   for academics as far as what's your plan for academics, what subjects is your child going
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:54.100]   to take, what scholarships is your child going to take, what types of input do you need.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.980]   That would be a really smart idea. You're slightly young, but the reason I'm mentioning
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:05.080]   this is I think one of the most productive activities for say a ninth grader to do or
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:11.960]   a tenth grader to do in summer is to do things like make scholarship applications. And I
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.720]   believe that a child's part-time summer job, the most productive part-time summer job is
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.840]   to do scholarship applications. And so you should be keeping that in mind and thinking
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.080]   about where are we going to be a couple years from now in terms of this particular child's
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:34.200]   interests. Now, back to kind of more of the nature of what you asked me. I think summer
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:41.800]   is a really wonderful opportunity for exploration of different things. And I believe that learning
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.840]   in and of itself is its own reward. And I believe that in their natural state, children
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:54.120]   love to learn. And so what you have the freedom and flexibility to do in the summertime environment
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:59.800]   is not to rub it in your face, but to rub it in your face is what we homeschooling parents
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.440]   have the freedom and flexibility to do all the time is to say, what do I think is good
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.720]   for my child to learn? And how can I find ways to engage my child with this? And so
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.600]   if you think that it's good for your child to learn coding, then you have the opportunity
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.280]   to say, hey, this summer we're going to practice coding. And then you make it as a project
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.660]   that you do and with a 12 year old with in together with your student and say, what are
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:31.600]   some of the activities that we can start to do that will help you with coding? Coding
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:40.920]   is fairly straightforward. There, your two best kind of starting points would be the
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:48.680]   Khan Academy resources on coding, which are coordinated by code.org. And they have a great
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.480]   number of projects. There are a number of, what's that coding language? I think it's
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   called basic or anyway, the first coding language that your 12 and 10 year old should learn
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:07.240]   should be Python. And so you want to start them on coding Python projects and you want
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   to try to find resources that will help them with that process. And so I think code.org
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.840]   is a great place to start and the Khan Academy classes to give them a little bit of the background
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.400]   on computer science. And then you'll want to try to see what other resources you can
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.120]   find to support that. So I'd take a big trip to the library and get a bunch of books on
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.080]   coding. I'd look around and see, are there any coding clubs? Are there any coding camps
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:41.160]   that we would like to enroll the children in? What is available? And then lay out basically
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:50.320]   your expectations of what the child can do during that summer education.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:58.640]   I think to continue on, I think that it's not, I think it's, the goal is not to have
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:05.600]   your child be studying and doing academics all year and all summer. I think that's a
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:12.000]   wrong approach as well. And so while I've mentioned a couple of academically oriented
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.040]   things, I would say don't underestimate the value of simply having free time. One of the
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.760]   things that is often difficult for our children in our modern context is their lives are very,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:30.440]   very stuffed full of schedules and they are very, they're over-scheduled and over-filled.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.760]   And this would be different perhaps than when you were a child. When you were a child, you
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.000]   probably had some times on your summer vacations where you felt bored. Was that your experience?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:48.360]   Yeah. I think my parents kicked me out the door and I went into the woods. We don't live
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.200]   in that environment right now.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.400]   So that's the challenge. And so I think that there's actually great value in creating that
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.360]   for your children if there's some way, that same sensation that you had of being bored.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:07.520]   Not that the boredom is the goal, but meaning creating some differentiation. And so if your
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:14.920]   child is simply at home and now your child doesn't have classes to go to, but he's non-stop
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.680]   playing games, non-stop in communication with his friends, et cetera, you don't have that
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:25.080]   same experience. So I think one of the best ways to handle it in the modern world, depending
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.760]   on your family's capability, is change the environment. So you might live in a city,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.160]   but you might make sure that you go and take an extended trip to the country, an extended
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.920]   camping trip with your children. You might send them to a relative's house for a couple
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.800]   of weeks. You might enroll them in a summer camp or something like that where they have
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.440]   a diverse experience. I think that those things are a really useful part of life. And that
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:56.680]   in the summertime, you should look and say, "Where are some things that I could fill out
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:06.280]   my child's deficiencies?" by exposing him to an environment where he can do things that
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.840]   he doesn't otherwise do. So maybe if you live a very cidified lifestyle, then maybe signing
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.880]   up for an outdoor adventure camp is perfect, right? Because you get to learn woodcraft
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.000]   skills, you get to learn to row a canoe, you get to learn to do archery, you get to learn
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.120]   to shoot a gun, you get to do whatever those things are that use the summertime as a time
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:36.320]   of offsetting your normal life and filling in those areas. Camps are obviously a really
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.720]   useful tool, but camps can be more expensive than you want to actually engage in. And so
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:49.080]   you can take the concept of a camp and start to bring it in to your home and say, "Here
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.360]   are the subjects, here are the things that we want to work on." So what I have done
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   myself is I have a giant mind map that I created of all of the subjects and skills that I want
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:12.240]   my children to excel in. And so those include academic subjects, and then they include physical
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.520]   skills, etc. And then what I'll do is I look at each of those skills and I say, "How am
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.400]   I doing with this?" And some of them are easy, right? Math is easy, right? We have a math
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.920]   curriculum, we do math every day. Some of them are harder, right? I have... I have...
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.440]   Pick one here, right? I have canoeing and boating, or I have vehicle driving as one
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.120]   of the things there. And so that may be hard for me, but I take that and I'm using that
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:45.960]   as inspiration to say, "I want my child to be skilled with..." Here are several that
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:52.000]   are related. Canoeing and boating, lifeguard training, and swimming, right? So those are
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.600]   kind of three related things. And so I can take those ideas and I can design a one-week
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.320]   summer camp for my children, or... meaning I do it myself. I can design a weekend trip
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.800]   around those skills. And I can say, "What I want to put in is I want my children to
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.920]   have some skill with canoeing and boating, I want them to be skilled swimmers, and I
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.080]   want them to have some lifeguard training. So let's find... let's prepare a four-day
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   vacation at a lake house where there's a canoe, where we're going to do lots and lots of swimming.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.040]   In preparation for that, let me find a book on lifeguard training or a digital class on
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.840]   lifeguard training that we're going to go through together, that's going to go through
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:36.640]   kind of more advanced than just swimming. And then let's go out to the lake house that
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.800]   we've rented. We're going to plan to spend a lot of time playing out on the water, and
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.840]   then I'm going to run them through a bunch of drills like dumping the canoe upside down
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.920]   and here, I'm drowning, save me, or whatever the version of it. Mine are too young, we're
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.680]   not to that point yet, so I'm just ideating with you. So you make your list of the things
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.120]   that you want them to do, and then think in the context of what your children like and
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.040]   what your children don't like, and your financial resources, your time resources, etc., what
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   would work really well for them. And I think that if you embrace using the summer for that,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:14.200]   then most of your academic subjects are probably well enough served by your local school. And
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.680]   then you just simply build the environment around them where you can shore up some of
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.240]   those things that they are weak in. I have a few more ideas, but I'll pause. Is this
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   helpful as far as your question? >> I think it, yeah, I do think it is. And
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.280]   I guess I was specifically also thinking about the foreign language aspect of that. And if
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.080]   I go back in shows, there might be something there where you talk about how you taught
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.160]   your children that already, right? >> I can do this all day. I don't suffer from
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.880]   things. I'll talk about foreign languages now. All right.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.840]   >> You didn't mention that in your- >> I haven't mentioned it yet. This is a
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.480]   subject I spend hours and hours every week thinking about this particular topic. It's
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.720]   a huge passion of mine. And so you're scratching the surface of an inexhaustible store of ideas.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.360]   You just point me in the direction you want me to talk about. Let's talk about foreign
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.080]   languages. >> Yeah, well, because one of the disappointing
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.680]   things that I found with the change in the school curriculum was the post pandemic is
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:24.400]   the language for my son, it was just put into like the first semester. So he had the semester
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.560]   of German and now he hasn't had anything since then. So I think exactly what you said at
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.160]   the beginning of the conversation where I should be peppering that throughout. I should
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.240]   have already been doing that, but I can't do anything about that now.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.720]   >> That's okay. >> But in preparation for the next semester
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.880]   when I'll pick that back up. >> Okay. So let's talk about foreign language.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.480]   I am in the process of teaching my children German. So we'll just use German as an example.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:57.120]   And I'll tell you what my plans are with their needs for how to help them. So let me explain
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:06.440]   what I do right now, literally this morning with my children with German. So first, this
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:13.540]   does come, I am an intermediate advanced language learner, meaning I'm not a clueless parent
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.160]   who doesn't know how to do it. I have studied intensively the topic of language acquisition.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:26.200]   I've tried to understand the various things that are out there. And I have tried to incorporate
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:32.360]   that into what I think will work for my children. So the very short review of this is that the
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   way that you learn a language is by being exposed to the language. That's the way you
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.480]   learn a language is by being exposed to it. And what you need is you need comprehensible
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.080]   input. If you have a student who is very self-motivated, then you can just simply provide your student
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:56.880]   with good skills. My students are not particularly motivated to learn languages. It's not that,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.400]   it's not a big thing to them. They don't resist it, but it's just not something that they're
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   asking for. And so what I am doing is I'm creating the environment around them where
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   they don't really have, where they don't really have the choice. And so I do that without
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.060]   going to the environment. Is it true that if you could take your children to Germany
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.960]   for four months every single summer and put them exclusively in a German-speaking summer
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.420]   camp and exclusively German-speaking environment, that they would probably make a lot of progress
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.560]   in German? I think it is true. Is that something that you have the capacity in terms of your
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.600]   time freedom and your money freedom to do right now?
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.400]   Probably not this summer, but I guess I could do that in the future.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   Maybe in the future.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   I really did it.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:50.180]   Right. So what I do is I try to figure out how can I get language resources into my children
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:55.380]   and for exposure. So the very first step, I'll literally play you right now on my computer.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.260]   I'll literally play you. I make these audio files. I'll play about one minute. These are
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.140]   the audio files that my children are going through together. This is something that I
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:08.060]   create and I create them with these little stories that I then narrate over to help them.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.620]   And I play these. These files end up being about less than 10 minutes. And I play them
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.540]   basically three times a day at the breakfast table, lunch table and dinner table for them.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:23.100]   So here's an example of what I create for my children.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.140]   German mini stories, story one with English translation.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.800]   Ich erzähle euch jetzt eine kurze Geschichte über Markus.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.620]   I'm going to tell you a short story about Markus.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.340]   Markus steht jeden Tag um sechs Uhr auf.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.900]   Markus gets up every day at six o'clock.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.100]   Er macht Frühstück und trinkt einen Kaffee.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.460]   He makes breakfast and drinks a coffee.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:57.300]   So I'll stop there. What these are is these are the story, the mini stories from LingQ.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.460]   I've taken those and then for my own use, I take the audio from them and I overlay it
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.000]   with the English translation because while I love that particular software application,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.680]   my children won't use it. They don't like it. They don't want to use it. And so I create
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.500]   an audio version and I play this for them.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:20.180]   Then I'm in the process of, I've commissioned a German speaking friend of mine to record
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.540]   a number of, since I don't speak German, to record a number of Spanish books. And what
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:32.180]   I'm doing is I'm trading Spanish language stories with German stories. So I'll give
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.660]   you an example here. I'll play an example of one of the Spanish stories that I have
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   made for my friend. And this is the way that I taught my children Spanish and French and
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:46.140]   I'm basically commissioning it in German now for them. So here's an example of what I send
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.660]   to my friend because my friend is trying to speak, teach Spanish and I've commissioned
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.900]   my friend to make German stories for me like this.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:41:00.820]   Los Hollister in Suiza. The Hollisters in Switzerland. Por Jerry West. By Jerry West.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.620]   A bilingual recording in Spanish and in English.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:14.260]   Capitulo uno. Chapter one. Un tropezón en la nieve. A stumble in the snow.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:20.220]   Un gran copo de nieve fría, a large cold snowflake, fue a aterrizar en la punta de
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:26.340]   la naricilla, landed on the tip of the little nose, de la pequeña Sue Hollister. Of the
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:33.460]   little Sue Hollister. El copo se derritió antes de que los ojos oscuros de Sue, the
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.220]   snowflake melted before the dark eyes of Sue.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.220]   So that's enough. It gives you an idea. I do these bilingual children's stories and
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:46.380]   I find that this is a really effective way of getting them started in the language. And
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.580]   I require my children to listen to them. I don't have to force it because it's kind of
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.660]   interesting. I work really hard to make sure it's interesting. But I do just simply require
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:59.440]   them to listen to the stories. And that provides the basis. And then the goal is to get them
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:06.860]   quickly to where they can consume audio books and written books in the native language without
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.900]   translation. I have already purchased a bunch of audio books and a bunch of written books
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.140]   and as soon as we can get to those I've got those ready. And they require them to have
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.660]   a significant amount of reading exposure and listening exposure to the language. Then after
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:26.840]   they have read and listened extensively to the language, then I will schedule a significant
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.540]   activation trip to Germany or to a German speaking environment to help them to activate
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:38.380]   the language. And so with lots of input they'll be aware of the language. I won't require
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.860]   any output but then we'll go and I've still been looking. So I have a folder on my computer.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.580]   I've been looking at German summer camps, all kinds of family camps, things like that.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.540]   And researching them trying to find something that would be exclusively German speaking
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:59.660]   authentic local material. And it's in my plans probably not for this summer but maybe for
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.420]   this fall that we'll go to Germany. We'll spend a month in Germany and I'll help them
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.100]   to activate the language. Maybe this fall, maybe next summer, something like that. So
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.260]   that's my overall plan and now you could take that and you could say what can I do more
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:21.060]   of. Probably it's more input. And so require your child to get more input. Try to find
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:28.020]   input that works for him so that he can understand more of it, etc. And I could give you, I may
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.460]   have a list if you go to my Twitter profile, I'm profiling some things but I have a list
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.220]   of YouTube channels that I'm using to get comprehensible input. You could do Khan Academy
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.820]   in German. That's been successful. I've had my 8 year old go through, he's going through
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   the Kindergarten Khan Academy in German to help with the language acquisition, etc. There's
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.540]   just tons of stuff available. And so if that's important to you then you can surround him
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:57.800]   with input and then figure out some way either with rewards or requirements, etc. to help
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.260]   him be exposed to it. So you can set that up. That's what I'm doing right now and you
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.140]   can find some version of that that will work for your students.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:11.900]   >> Steven: Okay, that sounds great. And his best friend, his mother is German so that
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:20.260]   certainly is a great thing. We're not far from Pennsylvania, Dutch territory too. So
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:25.300]   we can probably find a little bit of that as well. Great idea. Thank you.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:32.420]   >> Tom: If you could find somebody, what kinds of books does your son like to read? Does
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.420]   he like to read?
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:41.900]   >> Steven: Yeah, definitely. We put different things in front of him. He's certainly read
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.180]   all sorts of fantasy and Harry Potter type things but he's recently read Freakonomics.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.580]   He'll read a lot of different things.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.060]   >> Tom: So just starting with something like Harry Potter for example. Harry Potter is
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.620]   a wonderful language learning tool because it's available in virtually all languages.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.500]   It's a little hard to translate well, which they've done, but it's available in all
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.740]   the languages. But if you can get him to the point where either he can read Harry Potter
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:14.300]   himself in German and he liked it in English, then that's a good idea. Or if you can commission
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:21.060]   for yourself his best friend's mom to sit down and to read to him and do a bilingual
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.500]   translation like I just modeled for you or to make some kind of recording that he can
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:32.260]   listen to. It's not easy to do. It does take time and it doesn't really exist publicly
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:39.260]   because of copyright requirements. But it's possible or you can do it. One of the things
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:46.160]   that I also have done is I make the files myself and I'll go through and I'll take
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.380]   a book that I don't know and I'll translate it sentence by sentence to create the audio.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.100]   But if you can do that, that will help him immensely as well.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:46:01.500]   >> Steven: Okay. Good stuff. I figured that you might light up on this topic.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:08.300]   >> Tom: Yeah. And so a couple more. There's so much that could be said. I think at its
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:14.420]   core if I were to try to make the overall statement, decide for yourself as a father
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.940]   you need to look at your children and say where do I want my children to make progress.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:27.140]   And again, probably most of the academic needs are well covered by their schooling. So what
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:33.620]   may not be well covered is the non-academics. And so everything from dancing lessons. I
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.940]   think that one of the goals that I have for my children is I want my children to be good
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:45.220]   dancers. Because knowing how to dance well is a major boon, especially in the social
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:52.180]   life of a high school student, of a college student, etc. And so maybe you say let's take
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:47:00.040]   some Latin dance lessons. Let's do some whatever. You can go and get a course for them on break
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:06.500]   dancing and practice break dancing. Maybe it's physical fitness. We need to really improve
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:12.020]   our physical fitness. And I think that you as a father, what I think we should be doing
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:19.420]   as fathers is studying our children. And again, they're not yet capable of understanding
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:25.220]   how to improve their scenarios, excuse me, their skills of where they are. But we as
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:31.620]   parents, that's our job. And so if we identify that hey, social skills are weak. Well now
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.160]   you have a whole summer where you don't have to deal with homework, you don't have to deal
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.420]   with the teacher's requirements. You need to help your children develop better social
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:46.380]   skills. If you identify the fact that self-confidence is low. Don't allow your teenager to have
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.260]   low self-confidence. So figure out how can I do it, right? Let's get to the gym. Let's
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:57.220]   join a boxing club. And this summer, son, you and I, we're going to go boxing four days
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:02.220]   a week. These are the kinds of things that will make a big, big difference in your son
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:09.940]   and your daughter's experiences of high school. And if you will be proactive about saying
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:16.620]   here's where they need to be, then ensuring them up right now you can require, and you
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:21.300]   can make it fun of course, but you can require certain things that will make a big, big difference
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.340]   in your students' teenage years. So don't just think about academics. Academics are
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:34.140]   a big part of it. Don't just think about coding, but also think about again, physical strength,
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:41.340]   physical confidence, physical coordination, the skills that will be useful, social skills,
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:46.460]   dancing skills, whatever they happen to be, whatever area you want to shore up, you have
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.700]   an opportunity in the summer to shore those things up. And then of course, lots of free
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.380]   time, lots of library books, lots of voluntary free reading, lots of sunshine, lots of playing
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.340]   at the lake, lots of fun, et cetera. Those are all important. The only topic I didn't
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.740]   cover yet, because you have 12 year old and a 10 year old is summer jobs. I think that
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:10.820]   summer jobs are a very, very valuable thing to facilitate for your children as well. And
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:16.660]   at 12 years old, I think that that is your responsibility as a father to make it happen.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:21.500]   And this is one thing I'm very grateful that my father did for me was he worked really
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:28.860]   hard to help me get lots of summer jobs starting about the time I was 12 or 13. I don't remember
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.780]   specifically the year, but I would say about seventh grade. I don't know how old seventh
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:38.540]   graders are, but I remember that every single summer from seventh grade on, I had some form
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:44.300]   of a summer job that helped me immensely. Yes, it put a little bit of money in my pocket,
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:50.540]   but it helped me immensely to learn how to interact in an adult environment. Usually
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.380]   you have to be the one to arrange this. It needs to be a family friend, somebody from
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:59.260]   church, a business colleague, something like that. Because while your 12 year old can be
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.380]   useful, certainly your 12 year old is not the first hire that your friend would make.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.460]   You want to make sure of course it's an appropriate, safe environment. But having that variety
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:13.700]   of summer jobs did wonders for my confidence, did wonders for my exposure, did wonders for
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:19.300]   so many aspects of my personal growth. And I think that it's really good if you can help
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:27.140]   your students to have jobs. The two cautions I would give on that subject is, number one,
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:36.340]   I think while any job can be helpful, I think I see limited benefits of the so-called standard
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:41.860]   summer jobs. What I mean is, what are the standard jobs? Well, I can be a waiter in
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:47.540]   a restaurant, or more properly for someone very young, I can be an attendant at an ice
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:53.740]   cream shop, or I can do some kind of retail job, etc. That may be fine for an experience,
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.740]   but those jobs are extremely limited in terms of the skills that they impart and the path
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:03.700]   that they open up. They can be a good first step, because at least I think that any kind
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:11.420]   of work that's honest work can be very helpful. But it's better to have a summer job where
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:19.660]   there's some kind of skill acquisition beyond simply, you know, flipping burgers or scooping
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:23.940]   ice cream out, something like that. Those are fine for a start, but that should be a
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:29.660]   two months of experience and then move on. The other thing that I think you should pay
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:37.860]   attention to is making sure that there is a real variety of jobs, so that especially
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:44.620]   in an environment that can lead to some greater lessons. So, if you imagine yourself to be
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:52.220]   a very wealthy person, right? What skills do you want your child to have as the father
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:52:00.660]   of a child, a very wealthy father? It's not just, again, saying "Can I flip your burgers?"
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.540]   although that's helpful, but what you're trying to do is you're trying to expose your children
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.300]   to a diverse set of experiences, so that they can learn things that they're good at, things
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:13.460]   that they're not good at. So, I learned from my manual labor jobs that I don't want to
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.020]   do this. I learned from my easy jobs that they weren't intellectually satisfying. I
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:24.580]   learned from my intellectual jobs that, hey, that's good, but I have other desires as well.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:32.020]   And so, you can go to your, look around your friends, look around your peer group, your
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:36.700]   neighbors, etc., and try to find opportunities for your child to work. However, I think that
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:42.540]   those shouldn't get in the way. The goal is not to have your 13-year-old earning his own
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:49.220]   way. They shouldn't get in the way of cool opportunities. A friend says, "Hey, come with
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.740]   us to the mountains for the weekend." Right? A 13-year-old should be able to go to the
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.980]   mountains and have that kind of set of experiences, or, "Hey, come to Europe with us," or whatever
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:02.060]   your context is. And it shouldn't get in the way of academics. So, clearly, academics for
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:09.740]   an academically inclined student, academics are more important than earning money. And
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.340]   so, having a summer job where it's not all summer, you can still go to camp, you could
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:20.220]   still go on vacation with family, etc., but yet where there is some summer job, I think
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:24.380]   is the best mixture, if you can figure that out. Not easy in today's world, but that's
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   the best, in my opinion. >> Okay. Well, that definitely gives me,
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:36.380]   as I hoped, some just ideas that I never thought of, which happens almost every time I listen
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.140]   to your podcast. >> Well, thank you for calling in and asking
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.740]   a thought-provoking question. So, I hope that you guys have a great summer, and then call
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:51.020]   in the fall to a live show and tell me what worked, what didn't work, and then we'll see
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.780]   if we can refine this into better and better frameworks for other parents in the future.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.980]   All right. I got a bazillion callers on the line, so I thought that was a fruitful conversation
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.540]   and worth working on, but we'll go ahead and make some progress on the phone lines here.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.180]   Charlie, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:12.100]   >> Hi, Joshua. I'd appreciate your insight on our situation. So, we're a family of five.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.980]   We've been happily renting for a few years while saving up for a house down payment and
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.300]   deciding where we want to plant our flag geographically before buying a house. But we've been given
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.300]   notice that our current rental situation is going to come to an end in August as our landlord
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:28.860]   plans to sell the house, understandably so. So, as I see it, we have a few options. We
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:34.620]   could buy a house right now, despite the rising interest rates and currently high prices.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.660]   Alternatively, we could buy this house that we've been living in. We may be able to get
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:44.140]   a good deal on it, but we don't really see it being a perfect long-term situation. Or
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.860]   we could theoretically find another rental and wait a little bit to see what the market
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:53.340]   does. But in the last two or three years while we've been here, the rental market has gone
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.500]   up a lot and we would probably be going down in quality a lot or up in price a lot for
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:02.860]   rental. So, I was wondering if you had any advice on predicting the future and deciding
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:06.020]   what the best housing arrangement might be at this time.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:12.660]   >> How old are your children? >> They're young, one, three, and five.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.500]   Your biggest factor is going to be the age of your children, meaning it's relatively
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:23.100]   easy to rent, even if it's not a great rental house when you have babies and when there
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:29.180]   aren't many of them. But as you have more children and as they get older, they get more
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:35.980]   and more active and this is the driving reason why you want a more and more comfortable house.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.780]   And so, the time is short for you to get your family into a place that fits your family's
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:47.740]   needs. And it should be a high priority for you. Do you have any clarity on where you
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.980]   want to be geographically in the coming years? >> Yeah, we do want to stay put where we are
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:56.300]   now geographically. We settled on that in the last year or so.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:03.420]   >> And do you have the money that you could afford to either buy this house or to go and
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:07.460]   afford to buy another house? >> We could definitely afford the one we're
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:14.060]   in. We could probably afford another one as well, but with rates high and prices still
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:20.620]   pretty high, it's not quite as much as we would hope to have long-term in a house.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:31.260]   >> I think that you should buy a house. Financially, it almost always pays to buy a house. If you're
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:36.620]   going to be somewhere for a while, it really just almost always pays. And especially at
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:43.940]   the phase of life that you're in, it pays to have control over your house, have stability,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:50.180]   and it pays to give your family some sense of settledness. Even if it's a five-year house,
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:54.180]   living it and saying, "Okay, this is our house for the next five years," having done it both
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:57:00.220]   ways, I think it really is more attractive for your family to know where you're going
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.460]   to be. The benefit of going after the house that you're in is you know everything that's
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.460]   right with it and everything that's wrong with it. And that's so powerful. The biggest
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:13.100]   risk of purchasing something from another person is generally, "What are they not telling
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.300]   me?" And so you've lived in the house, you know what's right with it, you know what's
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:23.060]   wrong with it, you know what works for your family and what would need to be adjusted
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:28.020]   and what would need to be fixed. You would save potentially quite a bit of money by going
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:33.180]   ahead and doing a deal privately with the landlord. Number one, the landlord, depending
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:38.780]   on the landlord's normal way of selling the house, will probably save a good amount in
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:45.660]   selling expenses. Realtor expenses, fewer costs of marketing the property, dealing with
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:50.820]   anything. You probably could talk the landlord down a little bit on price and arrive at a
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:57.180]   very fair bargain by agreeing to take the house as is. I would assume the landlord would
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:03.180]   have in his mind a budget that, "Okay, my renters are going to leave, then I'm going
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.580]   to spend X amount of money on fixing the house up, shining it up, putting it on the marketplace
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:13.940]   and getting it ready to go." You may be able to get the house with that budget out, which
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.740]   could be a great buy, especially that you know what needs to be fixed and what doesn't
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.260]   need to be fixed. If there's something that needs to be fixed, then of course you can
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.680]   negotiate that with them and say, "Hey, either give us an allowance in the purchase price
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.380]   for these defects of the property or go ahead and fix these things for us before we buy
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:34.780]   the property." Depending on the landlord's cash needs, you may even be able to do a scenario
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:42.860]   where the landlord holds the financing, which could be great. That's worth exploring. I
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:47.340]   think all those savings are significant. In addition, you save on moving costs, which
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:54.420]   while not usually that much, they are real moving costs, both in money and in time and
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:00.380]   in effort. You save on furnishing costs. You don't have to go and redo the furniture because
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:06.980]   it doesn't fit, etc. You know what those things are. If the house is suitable to you, if you
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:11.700]   like it, even if it's not perfect long term, if it could be suitable for the coming years,
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:17.760]   then I think it's in your best interest to pursue this house. That would be my primary
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:23.980]   goal. The reasons not to buy the house would be if you said it's clearly not suitable,
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.660]   there's something that just doesn't work, we don't want it, we've been waiting to move,
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:31.820]   in which case I would say go and shop for a house. I think the great thing generally
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:39.420]   about rising rates is that rising rates should result in changes in price. Most American
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:45.240]   homebuyers purchase houses based upon the monthly payment. The monthly payment is driven
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.520]   by the purchase price of the house and the interest rates. While there's not an immediate
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:57.360]   one-to-one change that happens in one month, over the coming months I don't think you should
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.780]   be scared to buy a house just because rates are high. Rates being high will affect housing
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.460]   prices and they are what they are. As long as your finances are in order and you can
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.380]   afford the payment, then get the house. If rates rise more, you'll be glad to have the
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:18.140]   house. If rates decrease, you refinance. Rates are what they are.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.940]   That sounds good. Thank you for your time. If we had our perfect scenario, we'd be keep
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.280]   renting for a little bit longer in our current situation and then try to buy something that's
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.100]   more perfect, but we don't have unlimited time in this case. Thank you for your insight.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.780]   I do think that buying the one we're in has been creeping up as a more attractive looking
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:43.220]   idea over the last few weeks as we've seen the market around us. We'll keep our eyes
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.360]   open for ideas, but that might be the best one right now.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.980]   I don't know that you're going to get a steal because your landlord knows that housing prices
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:01:00.800]   are high, but you certainly can get a discount by saving the landlord marketing costs, hassle,
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.500]   etc. You should be able to get a discount and do the best deal that you can. Look around,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.240]   see what's available, but I would try hard to buy the house that I'm in at the moment
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.340]   knowing that in a perfect world, you live in it for five years, then you keep it as
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.880]   a rental and you move out and you buy a house that is more suitable for your family then.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.920]   So I hope it works out for you. Andrew, welcome to the show. How can I serve
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:32.720]   you today? Andrew, you're up. Andrew, we'll come back to you in a few minutes and we'll
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.640]   go on to 205 Area Code. How can I serve you today?
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:43.040]   Hey, good afternoon. I was calling to give your opinion on cashing out a commercial property
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:49.880]   versus a 1031 and I'm looking at it through the lens of having a pretty measurable capital
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:55.400]   gains and today's favorable capital gains rate versus what I suspect is going to be
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   higher in the coming future. I was hoping you could just give me your two cents on that.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.360]   Why are you selling the property? It's oversized for the business and it's not
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.580]   needed so we're scaling down. Okay. So your business is in it now and you're
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.980]   selling the property that your business has been operating out of. Are you buying another
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.840]   property for the business? I would like to wait until I feel like it's
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.720]   a commercial rates in our area at near all-time highs and I'd like to wait until I feel like
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.760]   I could get a better deal on a multi-tenant property in the future.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:37.780]   Got it. So do you want to continue to own commercial real estate?
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.120]   I really have enjoyed the passive income side of it. There's a part of me that feels like
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.780]   in the world of finances, I've built columns of stocks, business, real estate, et cetera.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.340]   And I feel like if I'm erasing items from one column that I should try to replace it
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:03:00.800]   with another item just to maintain that pillar of wealth. However, that's the primary motivation.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.180]   Currently I'm looking at beachfront rentals and trying to establish whether or not that's
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:13.040]   something I can get excited about. The rate of returns are fairly low for what I'm accustomed
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:21.700]   to with the primary care there being property appreciation versus annual income. And that's
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:27.420]   just due to the fact that the property values are at all-time highs at beachfront as well.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:33.980]   Right. Well, your question put in its simplest form is, should I sell this property and roll
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.540]   the money immediately into real estate and thus not paying taxes, or should I sell the
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:47.180]   property, pay taxes, and wait? That's your question, right?
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.780]   More or less. And it is kind of that simple because the flip side of it is obviously if
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.900]   you pay the taxes, and if I decide to pay the taxes, the property that I buy years from
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:04.500]   now is 20% higher. Basically I'm going to have 20% tax savings on a 1031 swap now versus
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.860]   paying, buying the same property later. I don't expect property values to fall 20% in
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:16.060]   this beachfront value. I can't get excited about the returns I'm getting. And so I also
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:23.060]   as a small business owner, I'm a little fatigued. So the whole idea of just paying off a laundry
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:28.660]   list of personal debt obligations is pretty appealing even if it comes at having to pay
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.300]   the capital gains associated with this property sale.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:39.500]   Right. To try to identify the factors that you have to decide, I would say the first
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:46.020]   question is, do I want to own more real estate right now? Because if you're going to do a
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.780]   1031 exchange, you have to buy another piece of real estate and roll the money immediately
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:59.120]   into it. And you should not let the taxes be the reason you make a bad investment decision.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.220]   If your money is better served paying off personal debt or personal expenses or buying
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:09.820]   a fun vacation, whatever it is, if your money is better spent doing that, then you just
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.580]   suck up the taxes and go for it. If on the other hand you do want to continue to own
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:20.300]   real estate, then there's no reason, generally speaking, there's no reason not to do a 1031
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.260]   exchange unless you can't find the properties. And so the question is, do I want to own real
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:29.500]   estate right now and can I find something that I want to own enough for me to buy it
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.420]   quickly? Otherwise, paying taxes is not the end of the world, but it's as simple as that.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:41.340]   Do I want to own the real estate right now or do I have another use for it? And to disconnect
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:46.260]   it, depending on the money, you could buy the other property, refinance it and pay off
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.620]   your personal debt. That might be a good move. I'm sure you've thought about that. And from
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:59.140]   a tax efficiency perspective, that's a good move. But if you can't find another property
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:07.540]   that you're excited about, then it's just not there.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.580]   So you can move your business out of the current property that you own and then just keep it,
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.460]   right? Why not simply move your business out and rent out the whole space and keep the
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.700]   property that you own and defer your decision?
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:27.700]   I feel like financially we're at a, I feel like the market for us is running about 20%
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:35.220]   higher than it normally is as far as cashing out of the property. And in a way, I think
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:40.500]   I'm answering your question is that maybe it just feels like it's time to exit more
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:50.060]   than it does. I don't want to own it any longer. That's probably the best answer is why. The
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:55.740]   monthly cash flow would be there, but it would be nice just to collect a paycheck on it.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:01.580]   Then sell the building, pay the tax and then wait until you find a deal in the future.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.420]   And the good news about that is that when you actually get into the property, yes, you've
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.560]   paid the tax, but when you get into the new property, you'll go ahead and have your stepped
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:18.860]   up basis. A 1031 exchange only defers the tax. It doesn't eliminate the tax. So that
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:25.160]   can be something that you remind yourself of to feel happier about your decision. Yes,
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.180]   some people argue that you can use 1031 for permanent deferral, right? You can always
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:33.260]   buy new properties. You can borrow against those properties for your cash needs, and
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.620]   then you can hold the properties until death and your heirs can get the step up and tax
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:45.540]   basis at death, thus eliminating the tax cost. That can work, but most of us probably aren't
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:51.380]   going to do that so aggressively. And so in this case, yes, you may go ahead and pay the
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:57.740]   tax today, but at least once the tax is paid, when you get back into another property, you
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.220]   have now a higher tax basis and you don't have that embedded tax liability lying over
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.340]   you. But it sounds like you're done with the real estate for now and you have other uses
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.780]   of the money. It sounds like from a lifestyle perspective, cleaning up personal debt and
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:15.540]   being in a better cash position might just be a better win for you. So take the win and
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:21.620]   pay the tax man. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. My pleasure. We go on to
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:27.620]   John. John, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Hey, Joshua. Thanks for taking
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:36.580]   the call. I have a question about my mom and some advice she's getting from her advisor.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:44.780]   He's not pushing her into it, but he had mentioned her maybe getting into a trust or looking
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:51.860]   into getting a trust set up. She had had some health problems this year. Looks like she's
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:57.900]   over them, but she's also pretty elderly. He had been talking to her about the five
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:03.380]   year look back rule and things like that for setting up a trust to protect some of her
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:11.220]   money if she was to go into long term care. But not just the expense of getting the trust
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:16.780]   set up, but also giving up all control, even if it is to me, and having very, very little
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:25.540]   in liquid assets allowed. She's really trying to protect that one particular contingency
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:32.820]   of needing to get assistance with long term care. It just didn't quite seem right to us.
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.140]   I was just curious about your thoughts on that or anything else that you might suggest
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:47.140]   to kind of pull it off as the final decade or two of the life.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:55.460]   So just to make it a little bit more precise, you're considering whether your mom moving
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:02.500]   assets into a trust could be helpful because of her advancing age and declining health.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:08.300]   And the specific benefits that you're hoping to get from a trust for her is that if she
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:15.540]   needed ongoing long term care, then she could potentially qualify for Medicaid long term
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:23.020]   care benefits without necessarily having to spend down all of her assets as is normally
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.260]   the requirement because she's transferred those assets out of her control. And that
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:33.780]   transfer has occurred five years prior or more than five years prior to the actual event
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.180]   needing long term care. Is that a good summary of what you've said?
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:44.300]   Yeah, I think that was the original approach to why they brought it up and also the fact
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.500]   that people in that trust, the amount of assets, could people be extremely strong, much less
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:56.740]   than too comfortable having a liquid, to have a requirement liquid.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:02.380]   So the reason I needed to specify the terms is that if someone says, "Should I put my
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:05.940]   money in a trust or not?" the answer is always, "Well, what do you want a trust to do for
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:12.080]   you?" There are many flavors of trusts that have different goals. And in general, one
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:18.620]   of the best ways to handle your assets, to make administration of those assets smooth,
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:25.740]   simple, effective, etc. is through the use of a trust. And so a very common trust, a
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.500]   living trust, a revocable living trust where I just have the Joshua Sheets trust and I
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.180]   put all my money in that, that's a very effective estate planning tool because then when Joshua
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:40.300]   Sheets dies, then Joshua's trust continues on and they're just a new trustee that's assigned
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.180]   to it or a new beneficiary that's assigned to the trust. But that doesn't do anything
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.000]   from Medicaid, doesn't do anything from Asset Protection Plan, doesn't do anything for that.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.500]   And so if you want a trust that's going to allow her to exempt these assets from Medicaid,
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:12:01.700]   that's a different road to go down. And so that's why I needed to make it clear and precise.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:07.740]   How much money or how many assets does your mom have currently, not in a trust?
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:18.340]   She has a house, probably in the range of $250,000, I'm guessing maybe close to the
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:27.180]   $200,000, not a fancy house or anything. She has probably, I'm guessing close to a million
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:32.180]   or yeah, probably just around a million dollars in assets that are in her investment. Some
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:39.580]   pretty basic things that are appropriate for someone her age. Nothing complicated, business
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.580]   files or anything like that. So pretty simple.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:49.500]   Okay. John, you may be speaking to me on a headset. It sounds pretty terrible and I can
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.020]   barely make out the words. Is there any way while I respond to you, see if you can do
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:59.460]   anything to get me a better audio connection, please. So if your mom has a $250,000 house
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:05.440]   and a million dollars of assets, then that's a significant amount of money and it's worth
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.900]   adjusting. It's worth paying attention to, to try to hold on to it. The first thing I
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:15.620]   want to clarify is what does it mean to do Medicaid planning? What it means to do Medicaid
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:22.660]   planning is basically this, let me get rid of all my money so that I'm broke so that
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:29.620]   I can go on government provided healthcare in the future when I need it. That's basically
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:34.880]   what it means is let me get rid of all my money so that I'm broke so that I can go on
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.660]   government paid healthcare in the future. My first reason I point that out is that's
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:45.580]   probably not your mom's goal for her life nor your goal for your mother. Would you agree?
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:50.020]   That's correct. Yeah. Yeah. That would not be the goal.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:57.460]   That's not the goal. So your mom's goal for her life is to use her money to provide her
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:04.500]   with the best possible quality of life and the best possible care if she ever needed
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:11.720]   it so that she can enjoy and be well cared for and well provided for her, well provided
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:18.320]   for throughout her entire lifetime. And your goal for your mother is that she has the very
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.460]   best quality of life and the best quality of care that she can have during her entire
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:28.600]   lifetime. And then it would be nice for both of you, hey if there's money left over, of
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.180]   course we'd like to have the money. If there's some kind of benefit that we can get that
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:36.940]   helps us, we'd like to have some kind of benefit, that would be nice. But those are secondary
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:42.460]   concerns versus the primary concerns which is the money paying for the best quality of
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.180]   life. Agreed? Agreed. Yeah.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:51.620]   So I'm not going to answer your question today any more precisely than that because I can't.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.700]   You need to speak with the Medicaid planning attorney, you need to understand the laws
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:15:00.420]   of your state, you need to understand what would be involved in creating the trust, what
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:05.780]   your mom's resources would be in the trust, what your benefits would be, what you can
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:10.620]   and can't do. This is not something that you're going to hide. This is something where you're
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.260]   going to follow the law to systematically try to put something in place. And if you
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:23.580]   can get Medicaid benefits, and if those Medicaid benefits are helpful, and you can keep some
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:27.620]   more money by doing it, yeah I think it's a good idea. But you want to make sure that
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:35.300]   the cost is not more than you can bear. Meaning that her cost of giving up the money to control
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:41.140]   the trust, making sure that she gets high quality care and not just Medicaid care, because
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.020]   that may not be high quality care, especially when she needs care. Those are the things
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:51.180]   that you need to really look into with the attorney. There's no reason that it's not
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.580]   wrong to do it, you just need to make sure that you understand the legalities of it and
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.660]   what it would open up and make sure that that's the right decision for you. And recognize
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:05.140]   that the reason she has money is to provide for her the best quality lifestyle. Medicaid
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   planning is a little bit complicated because Medicaid technically can provide care in a
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:16.260]   Medicaid nursing home. Technically there are provisions for Medicaid to even provide in-home
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:23.260]   care. But this varies greatly. For example, there have been many people who've had Medicaid
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:28.100]   care in a nursing home and they're like, "I would never put my mom into that nursing home.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:32.300]   Never. That one is just horrible." But then there are people who have had Medicaid care
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:37.980]   in a nursing home that have been very nice. There have been provisions for some kind of
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:43.140]   in-home care for Medicaid, but most of those provisions legally are not really encouraged,
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.540]   although that has had some changes over the years. The reason has simply been there's
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:50.700]   been a lot of fraud and whatnot of in-home Medicaid care. And so there was a time when,
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.300]   hey, you can only go to a nursing home. And so the language I used to use with clients
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:57.460]   was, "You don't want to go to a nursing home. I never met anyone who wants to go to a nursing
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.180]   home. So why are you planning on going to a Medicaid nursing home when you can stay
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:06.820]   in your own home?" That can change and it has changed some, especially as they've investigated
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.820]   different models. But right now with Medicaid, there are plenty of people who even qualify
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:16.020]   for Medicaid coverage. A couple of years ago, I did a story on the story from Maine, where
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.420]   there are people who qualify for Medicaid coverage. They have full government approval
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.700]   for getting the benefits, but they can't find nurses. They can't find people who will actually
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:27.740]   come and provide the care, especially at the Medicaid rates. There's just a massive labor
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:37.180]   shortage. So it's not an easy question to answer. And Medicaid, I think, is a last resort.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.900]   It's not a primary plan. So make the primary plan for your mother and then keep Medicaid
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.740]   planning as a component of your things that you consider, but in a secondary position.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:51.860]   And then get your attorney's advice on the costs of doing that and see whether you and
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.820]   she are willing to bear those costs.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:18:02.540]   Yeah, I think that helps a lot and put it in perspective. None of it felt very appropriate
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:08.820]   for her level of what she's saved up for. And knowing nursing homes in general, just
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:13.220]   even good ones, aren't really a place I really want her to be. And we have the ability that
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:17.420]   we live close up through that. I mean, my primary plan is to have her move in with us
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.780]   if she really needs that level of care. And we have the flexibility in our schedule to
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:28.540]   be able to care for her. So yeah, I'm glad I wasn't missing any big other advantage to
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:32.820]   it. But maybe we'll still have a talk with the lawyer. But yeah, I think that's really
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:37.980]   put things in perspective as to what it's really trying to do. And that's not really
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.980]   our goal.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.500]   Right. If you can...
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.500]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:45.580]   Yeah, my pleasure. If you can make it work, I think most likely the best solution for
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:54.340]   mom is see if you can have some kind of separate but close living arrangements in your house.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:19:00.800]   That might mean remodeling a bedroom so that there's a separate bedroom and bathroom and
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.980]   kitchenette where she can have privacy, you can have separation, but yet she can be there
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:10.580]   very close. It might mean building a little house in the backyard, something like that.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   And then if she needs care, then having the money that you can provide for a caregiver
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:24.020]   to help you is I think the best solution. Being a full-time caregiver for your mother
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:31.180]   is very, very taxing. So ideally, if she can be close physically, then you can provide
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:36.300]   with her with a lot of care. And then if you can afford to hire a nurse or an assistant
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.260]   to help with some of the daily care, that can really help to protect your health and
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:45.300]   your wife's health and help you to have the best of the relationship without having all
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.700]   of the difficult work. And so I think with that amount of money, she should be able to
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:54.920]   afford to help contribute to any kind of renovations that would be needed to make a comfortable
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.460]   place for her, that would give her privacy and yet closeness. And with that amount of
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:03.900]   money, I think she could comfortably afford to pay for care for the period of time that
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.900]   it would be necessary.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:15.020]   All right, we go to unmute, unmute, unmute. So close. We're trying to go. There we go.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:19.460]   We'll go to this one. Mauricio, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:25.140]   Hey, Joshua. Thank you for extending your call for us. So I'll try to be as specific
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:31.740]   as I could. So my question is, unless you get European, how valid would it be to get
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:41.220]   employed by my own online business that I'm running under an LLC, under an entity at Wyoming?
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:46.380]   So to give you a little bit of background, I currently own and operate two separate online
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:52.060]   stores. They're basically doing drop shipping from a major hardware store. I don't hold
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:58.700]   any inventory. Basically, my participation in the business initially started as I'm funding
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:03.980]   purchases for these products using credit lines, mainly business credit lines. Then
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:09.300]   I'm receiving these returns and I'm taking them typically to the closest hardware store
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:14.460]   where I live. But nowadays, I've tried to separate myself from that and I'm having a
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.340]   third party provider outside from where I live, which is outside from California, do
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:25.820]   this for me. So again, I live in California, started my business in California as a sole
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:32.100]   owner, but now I'm looking to move this under an LLC in Wyoming. So I have been advised
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:37.820]   that since my business is an online business, I can operate the business from anywhere in
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:43.060]   the US, wherever I want. It doesn't necessarily need to be in California and I can avoid that
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:50.340]   $800 franchise fee for that LLC. And I basically can basically, I'm sorry, I can basically
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:55.980]   move my business outside, which I'm choosing Wyoming, and then have my business hire me
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:01.580]   as a contractor from where I currently live, which is California. What is your opinion
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.900]   on that strategy?
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:10.460]   And to be clear, you're doing this so that you can save costs and taxes, is that right?
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:19.140]   Mainly for that, yes. And so that I can basically not have to be involved physically in or participate
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:23.500]   actively in the business doing returns. I can have delegated as much as possible from
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:30.100]   that business to somebody else and then just fund the business to grow.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:36.140]   These are separate things. So first let's deal with the California question. My answer
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:42.260]   is you will not save any money on taxes because if you are living in California, no matter
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:47.060]   where your business is located, no matter whether you're an employee of the business,
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:55.300]   you are going to owe California taxes most likely on all the profit from your business.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:00.620]   While there may be minor exceptions, there may be minor things that you can do to save
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:06.460]   money, none of these things apply to California. You are living in a state that is one of the
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:12.300]   two most aggressive states in the country for tax collection and is one of the two most
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:17.740]   aggressive states for basically saying you owe us California tax on everything that you
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:24.540]   do. When it comes to business planning, you cannot just play shell games, meaning that
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:30.260]   you cannot just have things that have the appearance of being different, you have to
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:37.540]   actually have substance. And so substance is the name of the game when it comes to taxes.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:44.860]   You have to make the substance of what you do different in order for you to save on taxes.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:51.700]   That's not to say that having your company based in Wyoming can't work, but generally
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:56.260]   speaking when businesses do business in California, they have to have a local California LLC.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:03.380]   They have to have a local California pay the $800 franchise fee. And so it's very important
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:08.460]   that you follow that law and you're not dealing with people who are unsophisticated, you're
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.260]   not dealing with people who are not paying attention. You are dealing with one of the
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:18.380]   most, first you're dealing with a massive economy that by all accounts, I forget this
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:22.620]   off, I can't tell you this off the top of my head, but if you go and you look and see
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:28.140]   what number in the world the California economy in and of itself would be, it's on the top
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:33.900]   ten list of global economies, bigger than many other major nations. This state also
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:40.580]   has a very aggressive tax policy, very aggressive posture, and a very well-funded tax collection
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.780]   department. You're not playing with people that you can just say, "Oh, okay, I can play
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.940]   some games." No, you're dealing with very serious people. So I would not do any of those
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:55.380]   things being a California resident. If you weren't a California resident and you were
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:02.420]   willing to change your residency, you certainly could have a different tax structure. And
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:08.940]   depending on what your lifestyle looks like, there may be some ways that you could structure
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:15.260]   your affairs in a way that allows you to spend decent amounts of time in California without
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:22.460]   actually being a California tax resident. So of course, many people moved to Nevada
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:27.460]   and Nevada is relatively close to California. And there are plenty of ways that you can
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.700]   prove to the California tax collectors that I have genuinely, legitimately moved to Nevada
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.780]   and yet still travel to California somewhat frequently to see people. But when you say,
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:43.220]   "I live in California," then I think your simplest and best solution is simply to keep
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:47.420]   everything in California. Keep your business in California and recognize that taxes are
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:54.980]   the cost of what I pay for being here. And don't play any games that are just shell games.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:59.860]   They don't work. What you could do... Well, let me just pause there for a moment. Do you
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:06.900]   agree with me? Disagree with me? Honestly, I just think, you know, so I'll probably have
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:11.940]   to read this information. But I agree with you that I have to be careful what I'm trying
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:19.180]   to do and recognize that California is very aggressive. Are you willing to consider moving
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:25.660]   outside of California at this time? Not at the moment. Not at the moment. All right.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:30.380]   So the answer to your question is very simple. If you're not willing to consider moving outside
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.180]   of California, which by the way is a totally fine decision, I'm not saying you should be,
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.460]   just trying to clarify it, then run everything in California, keep everything in California,
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:46.780]   and deal with the California tax bill and board as simply a cost of doing business.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.540]   If you see your business expanding in the future, then you can always ask yourself,
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:59.140]   is there a way that I can separate some of my affairs in some way? And so I think the
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:04.700]   most legitimate, it's probably difficult for many people, but the most legitimate tax savings
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:09.700]   that you can use is some form of transfer pricing arrangement. Are you familiar with
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:15.900]   the concept of transfer pricing? No, I can't say I am. Okay. So the basic idea of transfer
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:22.980]   pricing is, let's say that you have a part of your company that performs a certain amount
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:28.500]   of work that can be moved to another place. You can take that company and you can move
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.660]   it to another country. So you'd simply cut out maybe your entire accounting team or you
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.780]   cut out your entire creative team or you cut out your entire coding software development
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:43.500]   team and you move that team to another country and you set up a separate company in that
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:51.340]   jurisdiction that then bills your home company for those services. And so this is one of
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:58.660]   the primary tax reduction techniques used by large and sophisticated companies, is they
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:04.140]   create offshore subsidiaries that then bill the head company for their work and then those
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:13.340]   offshore subsidiaries are owned offshore and their profits can stay offshore in some cases.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.820]   This is more difficult than it once was, but it is possible to do that and it is possible
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:24.420]   to keep those profits stored offshore. But from what you're describing, if you're not
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:29.460]   willing to move outside of California, then I think that most of your tax reduction ideas
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:36.660]   about using another state or even another country just simply don't work for a California
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.980]   residence. What does work is for you to make sure you keep good track of your expenses.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:48.220]   What does work is for you to follow the law and deduct the maximum amount of expenses.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:53.380]   What does work is to fund retirement accounts. Those are the tax savings plans that work
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.700]   for a California resident.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:02.820]   Got it. Okay. I guess where I was confused is the fact that it's an online business where
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:10.260]   I actually don't go to the store and buy the product myself, where I get receive an order
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:16.460]   through my online store and I basically just go on the backend to this major hardware store
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:22.140]   and purchase it from them through the internet. I set up the address of this individual and
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:27.540]   I have it shipped to them. So again, everything is done from my computer. I don't necessarily
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.860]   need to have a place. It's still the business.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:31.860]   But where do you live?
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.860]   It's occurring in California.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.860]   Where do you live?
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   I live in California.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.660]   Right. That's the problem. Who owns the company?
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.660]   Myself, yeah.
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:43.900]   You do and you live in California. And as a California resident, you owe California state
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:50.860]   income taxes on your worldwide income. So it doesn't matter. Everything you described
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:56.860]   is true, but it doesn't matter. You live in California. You own the company. You're the
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.540]   one who gets the profits from it. Doesn't matter whether you have a company in Wyoming
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:05.260]   that all the business goes through and there's a bank account at the end of the year, you
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:11.640]   own the Wyoming company and thus you owe California tax on it. And so this is, again, we're dealing
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:17.220]   with California. And so California, if you have any business, any operations in California,
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:22.100]   anybody who has a business outside of California, they still have to file a local, what's it
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.780]   called, a foreign business or whatever it's called and pay the $800 franchise tax board.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:32.380]   So it just doesn't work with California. The key data point is that you said, "I live in
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:39.660]   California." And to the extent that you live in California, you owe the California tax
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:47.420]   authorities, income tax on all of your income from anywhere in the world, no matter where
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:54.280]   it is, unless there is some applicable deduction. Now, if a point in time comes in the future
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:31:00.900]   where you decide that you want to move outside of California, then you can rework everything.
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:05.940]   But to the extent that you live in California, you owe taxes on your worldwide income to
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.060]   the state of California. That's the law.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.060]   Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.460]   My pleasure. Just try to focus.
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:14.460]   If you don't mind.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.460]   Yeah, go ahead real fast.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.780]   Yeah, go ahead. I was just going to say, real quick, if you don't allow me, the gentleman
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:24.660]   that just talked about his commercial real estate, I was thinking maybe just throwing
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:30.340]   out the idea, maybe he already knows this, the subject to financing. If he's looking
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:36.980]   to get rid of that property to get some extra income to be able to pay off his debts, he
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:44.620]   can probably find someone that is willing to finance, become the financer of the sale
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:50.700]   of his commercial property, receive a down payment from somebody that's willing to go
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:54.980]   into that kind of business with him, receive a lump sum of money initially, and then receive
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:32:01.820]   a monthly payment until maybe a 10-year finance for that subject to or seller finance deal.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:05.940]   And he can receive the extra income for a period of years, use that extra income initially
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.140]   to pay off his cards, and then eventually move on with the next property. I just wanted
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.540]   to throw that idea to him.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]   Absolutely.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.540]   That's a good story.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.940]   I appreciate your adding the idea to the mix. Absolutely. Thank you, Mauricio. Wish you
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:24.340]   all the best. We go now to 432 Area Code. Welcome. How can I serve you today?
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.340]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.340]   Go ahead.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:34.620]   Yes. I'd like to thank you very much for all of your input on everything. I hadn't been
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:41.380]   listening to you a long time, but when I signed up, I'd like to affirm your summer job statement
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:51.100]   to the first caller. I worked as a summer job since I was 11, so it really helps your
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:33:01.180]   work ethic. So my wife and I have three kids, ages five, three, and six months. The oldest
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:13.220]   is getting to that school age, and he is very shy and very analytical. The middle sibling
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:24.700]   is a grade A certified buffalo, likes to destroy whatever he's doing. And the youngest is happy
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.620]   when he's not hungry.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   For now.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:39.780]   For now. For now. Yes. So we're looking to put the oldest in public school. Our local
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:46.700]   option, our school district is very large. My wife and I come from small districts, 1A,
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:55.260]   you know, Permian Basin of Texas. So our local school is 3,800 students. It's way more than
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:34:00.020]   we feel like doing. We have four options in the area that are smaller schools, two are
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:06.300]   250 students, more or less. Both of those are very close to where I went to school.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.940]   One of them is about 800 students, and the other one's about 1,100 students, and they're
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:17.820]   both actually closer. But I just wanted to ask you some opinions on things to think about
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:22.300]   over the summer. We're actually fixing to interview, we have interviews Tuesday and
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:30.740]   Thursday with two of the schools. The one that's actually the furthest and the most
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:36.820]   dangerous roads is actually one of our top picks, but we haven't seen the other schools.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.100]   So just wanted to ask your opinion on that.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:43.800]   Do you have concerns? Is there some reason why you're not confident with this choice?
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.460]   Whatever choice is on top of your list?
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:50.940]   We're actually very confident with that choice. The only thing is, is it's a 25 mile trek
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:35:00.940]   on a two lane oil field infested highway that claims lives regularly. So putting my entire
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:08.540]   family on the road, plus a day, since we would be transferring in, they don't provide any
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:15.540]   transportation. So it would be 100 miles a day traveling on that roadway. That's our
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:20.540]   only concern with that school.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:25.660]   It's a little hard for me to discern the question that you are asking. So let me give you a
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:30.780]   thought and then if you can clarify the specific concern that you have, I'd be happy to comment
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:38.980]   on it. What I would point out to you is you are at a stage of life with a five year old,
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:46.540]   three year old and a six month old where you should be very cautious about the precedent
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:54.980]   that you set. The good news is that still, even if your children were eight, you can
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:59.140]   still change anything. As a father you can say, "I'm going to change everything." Whatever
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:07.720]   it is. So if you observe that something is not working well for your family, change it.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:14.580]   Whatever it is. But right now you have not set any precedent and you need to be thoughtful
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:18.660]   about what precedents you are going to set because from here the price gets more expensive.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:25.860]   So for example, if you choose the school that's a 25 mile drive away, the day that you sign
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:29.780]   your son up for that and the day that you start that is the day that relationships start
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:35.300]   getting set. That's the day that he starts making friends. That's the day that you and
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:39.900]   your wife start meeting other parents. You start building a social connection and a relationship.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.540]   And yet you're signing up for a 25 mile trek every single day. As far as I'm concerned,
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:52.760]   that decision sucks because that lifestyle of having to face a 25 mile drive to take
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:57.420]   your child to school, that sucks. Especially with who's going to do that, right? Are you
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:59.940]   going to do that? Is your wife going to do it? Is she going to do it with a three year
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:05.460]   old and a six month old every single day there and back? This fear in the back of your head
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:11.620]   about this being a dangerous road, I think that just stinks in terms of a lifestyle choice
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:16.100]   to sign up for that much time on the road, let alone the cost. And I'm not just talking
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:20.180]   about financial costs, but just the lifestyle cost. And I know you live in Texas, I think
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:25.100]   you live in Texas, and yeah, of course, Texas you drive everywhere, but that stinks. And
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.140]   so I would look around and say, is there not some other option? Is there not a school within
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.540]   three miles of my house? Is there not some place where I can do that? Because this decision
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:38.780]   that you make is also going to drive everything else, right? Let's say you enroll your child
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:45.060]   and the school is 25 miles away. Every birthday party invitation is going to be 25 miles away.
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:51.340]   Every play date is going to be 25 miles away. Weekend activities, right? After school stuff,
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:55.740]   et cetera, it's all really far away. Now, I hope my intention is not to be hyperbolic.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:58.980]   I'm sure there are mitigating factors. There are probably other people that are closer.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:04.860]   Maybe some birthday parties are closer. But that's a really big lifestyle decision that's
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:10.340]   going to affect your entire family. And I think it's worth being careful of it. The
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:17.700]   other thing that you said when you were talking about the structure of, or the personality
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:23.220]   of your children, you mentioned that your oldest is shy and analytical. You need to
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:30.620]   really think carefully whether or not any government school, but most importantly, any
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:39.220]   large school is going to be helpful to the shy and analytical child. And I'll give you
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:45.740]   my... I won't. I'll save it. But I guess I would just say that right now you have total
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:52.340]   freedom. And so think about these big macro impacts in your life of the decision you make
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:56.980]   and then weigh that into your decision making criteria. Is there not a little neighborhood
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:04.860]   school, a little private school, a small local neighborhood school that's close to your house?
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:10.180]   There is. So the school district that we are assigned to in Texas, quote unquote, the school
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:15.740]   is not very far from us. And there are two private schools in the area.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.660]   It's just that the one that's close to you is the huge one that you're uncomfortable
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:22.460]   with? Yes, correct.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:27.500]   What difference does it make actually if the school itself is large to the child? Will
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:35.220]   the child's class be bigger? What's the difference in terms of actual daily life?
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:39.540]   Like you said, him being so analytical in a large classroom setting...
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.540]   Is there a meaningful difference? Would there be a meaningful difference for his daily life
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:46.300]   between those two schools?
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.020]   I think so.
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:54.580]   Yeah. So I, of course, couldn't answer the question. My only goal is to give you things
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:58.660]   to think about. As a father, right? You love your son and you want to do the best. I'll
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:05.100]   go ahead and give you the comment that I have on that I think is just worth thinking about,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:11.940]   especially if you have a shy or analytical child, using your words.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:21.100]   The most common objection that homeschoolers hear with regard to their children is the
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:26.600]   socialization objection. And it goes something like this. Well, if you homeschool your children,
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.720]   how are they going to learn social skills? And while most homeschoolers have thought
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.700]   about that question and they've learned to just laugh at it, I think that it's the opposite,
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.980]   that actually doesn't get enough attention. And so the point is that the defense that
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:47.180]   most homeschoolers will make is, "Well, gosh, I'm not so sure, right? Our children are in
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:52.060]   karate on Monday. On Tuesday, we have co-op. On Wednesday, we have church. On Thursday,
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:57.460]   where are they going to get their social skills?" The point is that homeschooled children get
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:03.140]   lots and lots of social exposure. And in fact, many of us would argue our children get vastly
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:07.260]   more social exposure because we don't waste eight hours a day doing schoolwork. We get
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:10.940]   our schoolwork done in three or four hours, which leaves lots more time for actual social
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:16.020]   exposure. Now, I'm not trying to make the defense of it in and of itself right at the
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:22.380]   moment. My argument and the step B is when I talk about it, I say, "Listen, if you have
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:31.100]   awkward children, awkward children are actually, generally speaking, in my opinion, the result
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:36.340]   of awkward parents. Parents who are awkward often have a tendency to create children who
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:41.220]   are awkward, regardless of the specific schooling decisions of their parents. Whereas adults
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:45.500]   who are socially competent often tend to produce children who are socially competent because
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:51.180]   the children model the behavior of the parents. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. What
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:42:01.980]   I think is under-discussed is the opposite, meaning that I am convinced that most... I'm
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.940]   trying to be thoughtful and not unnecessarily inflammatory, but I am convinced myself that
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:14.220]   the structure of modern schooling, and this applies to government schools, it also applies
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:20.700]   to traditional private schools that are modeled on government schools, that structure is psychologically
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:28.440]   traumatic for a significant portion of students. The entire structure is in and of itself socially
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:36.460]   traumatic. And so if I have a child who is socially awkward, the worst place in the world
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:43.100]   for that child to be is to be put into a school where now that child becomes the kicking post
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:51.540]   of the other children. The environment of a bunch of children who are in an age band
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:58.580]   where the parents cannot get rid of the problem children, and the teachers and the principals
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:04.500]   cannot get rid of the problem children, that is a destructive environment for students
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.220]   who are awkward, or who are shy, or who are not. The teachers work really hard to counteract
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:15.400]   it, but the environment in and of itself is really destructive. It's so destructive that
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.700]   as adults, if we were ever put into that environment, we would consider it to be abuse. If you and
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:26.420]   I as adults went into a company and there were 30 other people that were just simply
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.920]   randomly selected, not selected for skills or capability or for kindness or for competence
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:36.180]   or intelligence or anything else, but just 30 other people that were randomly selected
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.820]   that were our same age, and we were forced to go together in a room and try to figure
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:45.640]   out how to get along, and the principal couldn't kick us out unless one of us murdered somebody,
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.380]   and the teacher didn't have any effective means of control, there would be one or two
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:55.900]   of us in the group of 30 that are just social misfits, who are bullies, who are jerks, etc.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:59.460]   Now as adults, we would take that person on, we would beat the person up, we would kick
[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:03.240]   him out, we wouldn't stand for it, but as children you can't do that, you're forced
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:07.340]   into the environment. And so what happens is that environment in and of itself is a
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:15.180]   socially toxic and traumatic environment that chews up sensitive children, awkward children,
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:19.900]   handicapped children, it chews them up and spits them out. Now you can have in that environment,
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:23.300]   you can have the luck of the draw, you can have a wonderful teacher and you just happen
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.660]   to get a group of 20 other students that are actually really kind and a student can have
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:33.160]   a really good environment, but for every positive story there's a legion of negative stories,
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:38.300]   and when you start talking to people, especially people who are awkward, who are late bloomers,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:42.860]   who are fat, who are skinny, who are stupid, who have bad teeth, who are whatever their
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:47.700]   thing is that gets to be picked on at this certain time, the school environment in and
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:54.780]   of itself creates trauma. And so, forgive me if I'm passionate about it, but I look
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:45:01.900]   at it, and my wife and I were at a picnic recently and there was a friend of ours and
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:07.620]   we were talking about schooling and it came out that we homeschooled and somebody was
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:12.700]   like, "What about socialization?" And I sat up and I was lying on the grass with a
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:17.380]   hat over my face and I said, "Let me just share with you," and I kind of gave what
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:22.220]   I just said, and the point is that we don't talk enough. Why do we have this traumatized
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:28.140]   generation? School is a major source of trauma. So, to the extent that you're concerned,
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:33.100]   will my shy and analytical student fit in, you need to do as you are doing, which is
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:38.500]   to say, where is the best environment? Where can I find the best teacher who's going to
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:45.500]   help and protect my student while he has time to flourish and gain these social confidence,
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:50.660]   et cetera? Where are the best students who are trained and disciplined by their parents?
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:54.100]   But I myself don't have any hope of your being able to have any control of that in
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.260]   a government school, because about the best that you can do is pick among these four different
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:03.380]   options. And so, I'd encourage you, there's no rush. Your child doesn't need to start
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:10.180]   academics until much later. Maybe you want to start now, but literally, right, seven
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.740]   is a perfectly fine age to start any kind of academics. If you're genuinely concerned
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:18.700]   about that, recognize that maybe it's the environment itself that is toxic and traumatic
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:23.740]   for children. Maybe that's what actually creates it for the reasons that I identified. And
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.940]   maybe the best solution is to go to a local neighborhood school or organize something
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:31.380]   in your neighborhood. If you and your wife can't homeschool or don't want to homeschool,
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:34.980]   then maybe you find somebody who organized a little neighborhood school and give another
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:40.820]   year or two. And then choose some social activities for your five-year-old where instead of putting
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:46.780]   him in school, maybe you join a local karate class. Maybe you start to give him that where
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.820]   you can be there looking on. You can help him. He's not forced into a bad environment
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:57.140]   and you can help to bring him out a little bit to where then he can flourish in the local
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:03.140]   school. So I'm not accusing you of making a bad decision. I'm trying to simply highlight
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:09.580]   what I heard a hint of that I'm convinced that we spend not enough time talking about
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:16.100]   how that environment is traumatic to the weaker ones among us and that you can't change it.
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:23.140]   Because when you put a random cohort of 20 to 30 students that are age-banded, which
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:31.020]   is a deeply unhealthy thing, right? In our modern world, we talk a lot about diversity.
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:36.020]   Diversity is a double-edged sword. In some situations, diversity is an asset. In some
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:41.920]   situations, diversity is a liability. In order to understand whether it's an asset or a liability,
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:50.780]   you have to ask yourself, what is actually diverse? With children having a non-diversity
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:48:00.300]   of age, in some cases can be useful. But from a social perspective, it is generally a disadvantage
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:08.260]   because there's no sense of leadership by age. And so when you put a cohort of randomly
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:15.180]   selected children where you can't control the background of those parents, you can't
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:21.540]   control the training of those parents, and they're forced into a room, and the principal,
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:26.960]   because it's a government school, the principal can only kick out the very worst offenders,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.020]   that is a recipe for social psychological trauma. And that's why one of the reasons
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:36.460]   that contributes to why we see so much. So forgive me if it sounded like I was yelling
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:41.460]   at you, just trying to articulate why this is a big deal, especially if you have a shy
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:48.380]   or sensitive child. >>I actually appreciate your passion.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:53.140]   >>It's really tough. So those are the two points I'd make. Be careful about what you
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:57.100]   sign up for. 25 miles is a long time. That really stinks to spend that much time in a
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:01.620]   car. I know it's normal in Texas, but it does really stink to spend that much time in a
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:05.260]   car. And just go back to the drawing board and see if maybe there's a third option that
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.940]   we haven't thought of that would be a better lifestyle for us and a better lifestyle for
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:14.700]   and a better solution for the needs of our particular children.
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:20.100]   >>Great. Awesome. Well, I appreciate your input. >>My pleasure, sir. All right, got
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:25.980]   two callers left. We'll see if they are here. 619 Area Code, how can I serve you today?
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:32.020]   >>Thanks for taking my call, Joshua. It's been a long time listening. I've taken several
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:37.740]   courses of yours, so I just appreciate all you do. And I'm calling today for some career
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:44.140]   changer advice. I know I'm unhappy where I'm at, but I'm very unsure of what I want to
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:52.260]   do next. But my current role is definitely my highest earning potential by far. And I'm
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:58.380]   not ready to move on from that without knowing what to do next. So I've kind of set post
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:05.060]   fire as a benchmark for myself to hopefully minimize the regret of possibly leaving too
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:11.060]   soon. But I'm trying to figure out if you have any advice on figuring out a reasonably
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:17.900]   accurate post fire target number, because there's so many variables and so much time,
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:23.380]   precision feels pretty impossible. And I'm also wondering if that's really the right
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:30.100]   goal to have, or if a better goal would be to focus more on spending time exploring interest
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:37.180]   or what the possible next move might be. >>So let's first define our terms. When you
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:44.260]   use the term "post fire," my understanding of that term is you're describing the concept
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:51.260]   that you have saved and invested enough money that at retirement you could support your
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:56.580]   needs. So therefore, if you choose to change something with your job or your work, you
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:00.860]   would just need to cover your lifestyle. Is that the way you're using the term?
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:07.100]   >>Yes, that's correct. >>Okay. So the idea is you've saved aggressively.
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:11.900]   If you do a retirement calculation, okay, 65, I have enough money to live on. So now
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:19.780]   I'm going to perhaps pull back from this job that I don't really like, but I've maximized
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.900]   my earning capacity. And I'm just going to try to find something that provides me with
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:29.380]   a better lifestyle that's enough to meet my expenses. That's the basic plan that you have
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:32.740]   for the coming years. >>Exactly.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:39.580]   >>Okay. Now, please repeat your question so that I can answer it now that we've clarified
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.140]   our terms. >>Sure. So I'm just trying to figure out
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:52.100]   if you have any advice on figuring out a reasonably accurate post fire number with the time horizon
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:58.780]   and all the variables. And I guess the variables I'm considering are expected returns, inflation,
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:05.460]   take withdrawal rate, and then expected expenses in retirement, given how young I am. All those
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:13.220]   numbers feel very murky. So it just feels very hard to even come up with a remotely
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:17.420]   accurate forecast of when I've actually achieved that benchmark.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:20.580]   >>How old are you now? >>31.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:27.140]   >>And how much are you earning currently? >>$100,000 per year with bonus.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:32.900]   >>And about how much do you have saved? >>$150,000.
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:40.340]   >>And about how much are you spending? >>I save 50% of my pre-tax income or more
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:49.740]   between 50% and 70% depending on how I'm doing. >>So the answer to your question is we could
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:56.060]   do some calculations, right? But all of those calculations are estimates as you're pointing
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:05.260]   out. What number should we use for after tax, after inflation, real returns on our portfolio?
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:11.500]   We could use the historic stock market number, but maybe that's not quite enough. What maybe
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:15.540]   the next 20 years are different than the last 20 years? Who knows, right? A lot of smart
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:24.780]   people think that they're going to be, but we don't know. I guess, frankly, what will
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:33.300]   be the safe withdrawal rate 34 years in the future? Who knows? I'm not opposed to using
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.500]   any of the current numbers to get at it. I would just say, pick any retirement calculator
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:43.980]   you like. If you'd like, I'll grab my calculator and we can run some numbers. I guess I would
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:48.940]   look at it and say that I don't think that you're going to probably find any sense of
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:57.580]   solidity in those numbers because the forecast is so far away. And I would say that at 31
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:04.420]   years old, are you married? Do you have children? Or are you just responsible for yourself?
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:11.380]   No, we have one child. We have one on the way.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:21.380]   Okay, great. I guess I think you should go and just ignore financial independence and
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:25.540]   focus on building a life that you don't want to retire from. And if that means you cut
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:30.860]   your income temporarily, as you may know from my income course, I made this argument. I
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:36.860]   said this, I said, if you give me two people, the one person who is just earning as much
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:41.300]   money as possible, but doing something that's not a good fit for him, and the second person
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.540]   who's doing something that's a good fit for him, I am convinced that in the fullness of
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:52.740]   time, that the second person will go far, far farther financially. And even if he doesn't,
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:57.500]   he'll have a better, more satisfied life. I think that the most precious thing that
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:03.660]   you have is time. And the way that you use that time is the most important thing. And
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:08.660]   you've proven yourself to be the kind of person who has a long time horizon. If I'm spending
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:12.420]   time with you, I'm going to spend a lot of my time trying to say, listen, dude, you're
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:18.020]   31 years old and you're rich, right? You're in the top, I need to look at the numbers,
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:22.260]   but what's probably six to 8% of the world population in terms of wealth, you're very
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:27.740]   rich. So why don't you just start acting like someone who's rich and start building a plan
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:35.740]   for the next decade that excites you. And leave 65 alone for now until you make that
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:42.500]   plan. And I'm fine with, I think it's good to run the numbers and say, okay, here's my
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:48.340]   coast fire assumptions. But the only goal of that is to give you a personal sense of
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:55.020]   mindset freedom where you're willing to go ahead and take the jump. But I think that
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:59.060]   there are a lot of people that I observe who are prisoners to this idea that I have to
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:05.100]   have money. And I've been there. And every time I've taken the jump, I've never regretted
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:10.660]   it and I've realized that the bars were in my head. I didn't need to be as rich as I
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.780]   thought I needed to be to make this step. All I needed to do was just make the step.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:18.020]   And so if you recognize I need to convince myself I need to have more money to make the
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:23.860]   step, fine. But that's your own weakness. And so the idea that you have to be coast
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:29.780]   fire, check the box, I'm there, I think is a weakness. It's not something to be embraced.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:34.740]   It's a weakness. You're a rich guy. Just pick something else that you think has a better
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:39.660]   chance of putting you in a direction you might enjoy more and then go in that direction.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:42.780]   And it doesn't have to be perfectly thought out. It doesn't have to be planned out. You
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:46.460]   don't even have to be sure that it's the right long-term solution. You just have to have
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:53.180]   some idea that it's leading you in a direction that's better than where you want to go.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:57:03.340]   Have you ever sailed across the ocean or do you watch any kind of sailing YouTube channels?
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:07.340]   No, but I certainly wish that I had sailed across the ocean.
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:13.500]   Okay, well I can describe the concept simple enough. So the basic idea is if I use a GPS
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:23.260]   example on the road, then we're very accustomed to our GPS predictions now being quite accurate,
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:28.860]   especially in light of real-time traffic updating. And they are quite accurate. If I'm in Miami,
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:33.740]   Florida, and I put in my GPS and I say I want to drive to Seattle, Washington, there's a
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:42.900]   very good chance that I'll be there within a couple of hours of the time predicted. Now
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:47.220]   I don't know for sure, but meaning the total travel time is pretty reliable and pretty
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:51.580]   predictable. But I'm fascinated myself when I watch sailing channels and I look at their
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:58.140]   GPSs and their GPS does the same calculations that our car GPSs do. The problem is there
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:02.580]   are a lot more variables, especially when they're sailing. They're sailing and the best
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:08.380]   they can do is have a rough estimate of, "Hey, this trip across the ocean generally takes
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:14.420]   21 days." And so we're expecting that it'll be 21 days. But it could be 19 days, it could
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:20.700]   be 25 days, and there's a whole lot of ocean between here and there. And the variables
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:26.140]   are much more significant. We're dealing with wind variability, we're dealing with speed
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:31.540]   over ground, we're dealing with mechanical issues, we're dealing with do we use the engines,
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:37.020]   do we not use the engines, et cetera. So the GPS is useful, but it's not accurate enough
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:43.260]   to actually make predictions on. And that's how I see what you're describing. I just say,
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:46.900]   "Listen, you know that you've saved a good amount of money. That should give you enough
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:52.300]   focus, but work on the next 10 years. Don't work on that 10 years, work on the next 10
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:57.700]   years." Because if you can make from 31 to 41 really good, then you'll be in a totally
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:03.100]   different place where you can make 41 to 51 even better. Then you can make 51 to 61 even
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:13.660]   better. And spending your time at 31 thinking about 65, anything beyond saying, "Hey, I
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:21.700]   save about half my income," is just, I think, overall a waste of time. So that's the best
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:25.440]   answer I could give you is I think it's a waste of time. You know that you're doing
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:32.620]   the kinds of things that... Are you a healthy guy? Are you in good shape? Do you add a healthy
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:40.300]   body weight? Yes, I work out every day. All right. Can you guarantee that you're going
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:46.420]   to live to 92 years old and be in perfect health all along the way? Unfortunately, no.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:53.020]   No. But what you can do is you can know that as I continue these activities that I do now
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:58.400]   of eating healthful food, being physically active, making sure that I stay abreast of
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:03.840]   my current situation, that there's the best chance that I have of living a long, healthy
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:08.140]   and active life. But there are things that can come against me. Right? That's the best
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:15.680]   that you got. Yes. And I'll say it certainly feels more exciting to think about 31 to 41
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:20.560]   than it does to 65. I really like the way you frame that because I know when I'm excited
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:25.640]   about something as I've proven to myself, I'll work really hard at it. Good. Good. So
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:29.720]   I think that perhaps that health metaphor is the best one I could give you about money.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:36.280]   You cannot know with your money that you're going to have enough money at 65. You cannot
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.920]   know it. It's not possible. You can go to any calculator and you can use it. But there
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:45.240]   are genuinely many events that go beyond the calculator. Right? How do we even know that
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.440]   the United States can continue growing into perpetuity? The last 200 years where we have
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.960]   2% per annum economic growth is absolutely a miracle in the history of the world. But
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:01.640]   can it continue? We don't even know that. All we can do is make guesses. So what I would
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:06.800]   say is you have good financial principles. The principles are I'm going to spend less
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.280]   than I earn. I'm going to save money and have that available. I'm going to save money and
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:17.280]   I'm going to invest money. When I invest money, I'm going to invest it at the highest possible
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.880]   in the best quality investments that I can find at the highest possible long-term rate
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.840]   of return. I can't guarantee you or tell you what the number is that you're going to need
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.520]   to have a 65. But I can tell you that as you continue doing that, then you're going to
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:35.280]   wind up in a good situation. Right? You're going to put yourself in the situation where
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.680]   you have the best chances of winning. So if we pull back to 31 to 41, if you can make
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:47.440]   – let's say that you could make a career change and you go from $100,000 a year to
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.680]   $70,000 a year. Thus now instead of saving 50% of your income, you can only save 20%
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:02:00.080]   of your income or 15% of your income. I would beg of you if that transition leads you to
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:05.040]   a life you're more excited about, I would beg of you to do that because it's not necessary
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:11.000]   to save 50% of your income to be well squared away at 65. You're way ahead with these coast
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.160]   fire plan. Now if you could just drop to 15% of your income, you're in great shape. And
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:20.400]   then that'll occur for a few years and then something will happen, something else will
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.240]   change, another opportunity will come your way, you'll adjust, you'll move, you'll change
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:30.400]   and you'll make those decisions. And as long as you're earning more money than you're spending,
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:35.760]   you're investing your money at the best possible things that you can find, you're going to
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:42.840]   be fine at 65. So I would say the health metaphor is the best I got for you, but I really think
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:48.200]   it's true and I think that once you're excited about 31 to 41 genuinely, then you go back
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:55.640]   and say, "Can I sweeten the pot for 61?" But you may not make it and it would be a shame
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.200]   to spend the thing that you can never get back, which is the time of your life, it would
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:10.480]   be a shame to spend that in a way that is not in your best plans just to get the thing
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.480]   that is the most replaceable thing in the world, which is money.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:18.760]   >>Jerry Holkins Oh, you're 100% right. And I think I'm just
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:24.760]   trying to pursue more perceived safety when in reality I have a bigger margin of safety
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:33.040]   than most anyone could ever reasonably want. So thank you for your advice and thanks for
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.720]   everything you do. You've been a tremendous positive influence on myself and I'm sure
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:38.720]   many others.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.920]   >>Tavis Thank you for listening and for being a customer.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.960]   I really appreciate it. All right, let's see if Andrew is there. Andrew, are you with us
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:46.960]   this time?
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.960]   >>Andrew Okay, thank you. So I have called in a few
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.440]   times over the past month or two, you may recognize my voice. I kind of asked about
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:05.120]   mustachion level, FI. So kind of going off your last caller, I am rich today. I could
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:12.120]   be mustachioned by today, but I'm also 31 years old and probably don't need to stop
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:17.400]   working today. And so I'm trying to figure out how to build a life I don't want to retire
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:24.240]   to because I have a 40 mile commute that probably takes about 50 minutes each way. And so I've
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:31.520]   been looking at other jobs and I have over the phone received a job offer for a similar
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:40.240]   role at a similar engineering industrial plant with a seven mile commute. So significantly
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:46.880]   better probably save about an hour and a half of driving every day. And one thing that I'm
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:52.200]   struggling with is that they over the last week, my company's corporate division has
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:05:00.800]   posted three fully remote engineering jobs that I reasonably qualify for. So I'm going
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:07.120]   to apply for those as soon as possible Monday once I talk with my supervisor to kind of
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:13.320]   gain his blessing. However, I'm wondering, does it ever make sense to respectfully and
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:18.880]   tactfully give your employer an ultimatum? Because if I have to stay with my employer
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:26.080]   for my current job, then I'm going to quit and go with the shorter commute option. However,
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.640]   I'm still showing up there at 6 a.m. Monday through Friday every day. And the lifestyle
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:37.200]   benefits of having a fully remote job, you know, I can't even put a price on that. So
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:45.840]   I'm trying to figure out like, hey, to be honest, Mr. Boss, I want these remote jobs.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:50.760]   And if you don't give them to me, realistically, I'm going to go to this other plant. But our
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:58.240]   HR process is probably not going to be complete to see if I'm a selected applicant for one
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:05:59.600]   to two to three months.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:06.960]   So my answer to your question is, you asked, does it make sense? Absolutely, it makes sense.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:11.800]   And first, let me give you a framework and then just my thoughts on how to go about it.
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:18.880]   The framework is simply this. Remember that employers and employees do not compete with
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:26.320]   one another. Employers compete with other employers to attract the very best employees.
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:32.320]   And employees compete with other employees to gain the very best employment or get the
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:38.520]   very best job. So you and your employer are not in competition with one another. Your
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:43.960]   employer is in competition with all of the other offers that you can get. So does it
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:49.640]   make sense to go to your boss and say, hey, I want this other job and if not, I'm going
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:53.920]   to leave? Absolutely, it makes sense to do that. And that's what you should do. You should
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:59.360]   get, you should take for yourself the very best job that you have access to that you
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:05.600]   can successfully compete for right now. And jobs are not for life. If you have a contract
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:10.520]   associated then of course you fulfill your contract, but most jobs don't have a contract.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:17.080]   You just simply try to do the very best thing. And your employer must from time to time sweeten
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:23.080]   the pot, especially if that employer is not doing it actively or should I say proactively.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:27.760]   So if you have a job offer and you're getting paid $100,000 here, but this guy across the
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:33.240]   street is offering you $120,000, then now your employer has a different competitive
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.920]   environment. Your employer needs to go across and say, hey, I got to offer you $120,000.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:43.960]   And you should routinely renegotiate with your employer. This is not game, and we'll
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:48.800]   get to the games in a second, but that's just the way of doing business. And a lot of employers
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:55.520]   get lazy because they get complacent. And what will happen is if you quit, your employer
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.040]   has to sit down and say, oh, wait a second, I need to go and figure out how to attract
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:04.960]   another employee. I may have to pay more money. I may have to offer more benefits. I may have
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:13.160]   to do any number of things and change it. Now, your employer wants to keep you. Why?
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:17.560]   Because hiring a new employee is one of the most expensive, disruptive things that your
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:22.800]   company does. It is a hassle. The employer has to pay headhunters often 50% of your first
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:28.120]   year salary. Recruiters may often get 50% of your first year salary. So recognize that
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:35.520]   every day there are employers out there that will pay a headhunter 50% of your first year
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:41.760]   salary to bring them a candidate. So then in addition to that, they have to take care
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:48.200]   of training costs, costs to get someone up to speed, re-equipment costs, painting your
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:53.960]   office, getting a new PC, all of this stuff. And when they do that, they still have no
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:00.880]   surety, no confidence that a new employee is going to fit with the team, is going to
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.640]   have the capacity because it's not a known quantity. So if you're a good worker, then
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.960]   yes you can and should frequently renew and renegotiate your contract. And that's very
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:18.400]   much within your best interest. And if you're an asset to the employer, the employer will
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:24.320]   work on it. Now, how do you actually negotiate it? First thing is, I think that there's really
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.840]   no need for any games. I don't think that games work. I think that straightforward,
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:36.560]   honest negotiation and honest communication is one of the best things that you can do.
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:44.120]   That said, don't deliver an ultimatum if you don't have to. So you may know that, "Hey,
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.000]   I've got plenty of money. I don't need this job and I've got other options." But you simply
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.360]   go to your employer and say, "This is what I would like. Would you be willing to consider
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:10:00.400]   this?" And then speak in terms of your employer's needs. So you need to talk about what your
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:05.280]   employer wants, what your employer needs. Always speak with what the other person wants.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.840]   And then just identify that, "These are the things that I need and I think that I can
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:15.360]   satisfy them if you can make these changes. If not, I might have to go and look for another
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:21.960]   job or find something that can satisfy that." And so that process is a fairly straightforward
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:26.480]   process and I see it as the winning process. Recognizing that your employer needs you and
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:31.680]   you need your employer, but you also have other options. And so just lay those out and
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:34.520]   then it's up to your employer to decide what he wants to do with it.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:41.280]   Yeah. And so I guess one clarification, are you recommending that I actually tell him
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:50.680]   I have another offer or don't? Or just straight up ask? The problem is if I asked to get this
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.360]   new remote job, he'd probably say, "Yeah, apply for it." And I'm not going to know for
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:00.080]   two months if I get it. And your other offer expires.
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:05.240]   Other offer probably expires in a week. Right. So then I would go and I would tell
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:12.200]   him you have another offer. What do you lose? The worst thing you lose is your job. So you're
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.440]   already willing to take that. You've already decided you're not going to do it. What do
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.720]   you lose? So I would simply go and communicate and say, "I really appreciate this job. I'm
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:24.720]   happy to have it. It's been a good... These are the things that I like about it. I like
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.120]   the company. I can't make this commute every day again. I've gotten an offer from a company
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:35.360]   that has a seven mile commute instead of this commute. However, I also, I like this company
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:41.800]   and I noticed that you guys are offering remote jobs. What do you think about what could we
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:47.920]   do to... I'd rather stay here than take my other offer, but I also need to make a response
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:55.080]   to them. What could we do that allows me to move into a remote job nine days out of 10?"
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:00.280]   Or something like that. And even for you, what I would encourage you to do is make your
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:05.800]   remote job nine days out of 10 or some similar arrangement where it's not 100% remote, but
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:12.200]   it's also not making your crazy drive every day. The best job situation, in my opinion,
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.640]   is 80% remote, 20% in the office. Something like that.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:21.680]   >>Adam: Yeah, I would love it if I could just go into the mine every two or three days every
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.680]   other week. I mean, that's equivalent to being financially independent or retired to me.
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:34.800]   I could go visit my friends or family and take a week and go to a destination, still
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:40.520]   work, put in my time, and then walk out the door and one minute later I'm doing whatever
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.520]   I want.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:47.040]   >>Dave: Right. Right. I think that if you have another offer in hand and you need to
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.600]   give the other offer a response, then yes. The right thing to do is to go, communicate
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:57.480]   clearly, explain what you like about the job, and then explain what you would like to do,
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:02.480]   and then tell them, "I'd like to have an answer fairly quickly." Straightforward communication
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:09.160]   is always the winner. Honest, straightforward communication. The response that you get is
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:14.320]   almost certainly going to be not based upon some kind of games, but rather based upon
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:19.160]   the quality of your work and your actual value to the company.
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:22.640]   They're going to consider it based upon how good you are at your job and your value to
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:28.880]   the company. If you are a high-value employee, and if they can agree to your demands without
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.400]   sacrificing some other thing that's important to them, then they'll probably agree to them.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:36.280]   If not, then you'll probably just go take the other offer.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.640]   >>John: Yeah. Thank you.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:41.840]   >>Dave: Yeah. My pleasure. I'm just glad you got another offer, and I think that you'll
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:47.000]   get untold benefits from having a shorter commute and/or having no commute, as you've
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.040]   identified. After you've reached a good amount of financial capacity, then one of the best
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:56.840]   things that you could possibly do is just simply seek to expand your lifestyle, and
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:59.240]   for you, that's a big opportunity there.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:04.800]   >>John: Yeah. I hope one of your previous episodes, you talked about your disappointment
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:11.120]   in going into new churches along your travels and not getting asked to go, "Hey, come over
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:18.360]   to my place for lunch," and "Welcome to the town," and I've often thought, "Man, you've
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:25.200]   inspired me and helped lead me in such life-changing directions that I hope to stumble into my
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.720]   church in Alabama, Montana, and I would like to invite you to buy a lunch."
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.200]   >>Dave: I would love to, but more importantly than that, what I would love you to do, and
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:40.600]   every listener to do, is to do what I have tried to do, is that when I'm in a church
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:49.240]   meeting on Sunday, if I see somebody, my goal is that no visitor comes through a church
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:55.720]   meeting that I don't invite for a meal, whether it be for a Sunday meal, in the way that I
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:03.200]   said, or sometime that week, because having been in that situation has made me just very
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:08.560]   sensitive to it. And I think that this is one of the most important things that we can
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:17.920]   all do, is that at its core, the entire meaning of the church relates around fellowship. Fellowship
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:23.240]   among other people. And that fellowship should not be organized from the top down, that fellowship
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:31.960]   should be spontaneous from the bottom up. And so, right, although it doesn't always
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:36.480]   happen because I have young children and they need naps and whatnot, I should generally,
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.200]   having a meal together after a church meeting or before a church meeting should be the most
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:45.360]   normal thing. And then it's my goal that always, if I see a visitor, I always at least extend
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:50.200]   the invitation. And if you and I do that, and we encourage our friends to do that, and
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:57.560]   if you can learn anything from my story on that, then I think it can make a big, big
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:02.040]   difference, and it's really worth doing. And I would encourage to you, there's a really
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:08.800]   wonderful little booklet written by Alexander Strauch, it's called The Hospitality Commands.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:12.520]   The subtitle is "Building Loving Christian Community, Building Bridges to Friends and
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:18.280]   Neighbors." Again, the author is Alexander Strauch, S-T-R-A-U-C-H. That little booklet
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:24.920]   is so useful, and it lays out even the biblical foundation of it. But I think that one of
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:32.160]   the best things that we could do to make progress in our local Christian communities and expanding
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:37.960]   those Christian communities is to systematically practice more hospitality. And I find that
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:44.760]   that hospitality crosses lines so well. I can invite people from any Christian nomination,
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:52.080]   I've had tons of atheists at my dinner table, Muslims, Hindus, every... hospitality is the
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:57.320]   easiest thing that's the least practiced among us where we can make progress. I hope to come
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.320]   through in Montana someday, but more importantly, I hope that when I come through, that you've
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:04.000]   had another 50 families in your house before me.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.680]   Love it. Thank you, Joshua.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.400]   Have a wonderful day, sir. Bye.
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:10.400]   You too.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:15.320]   Thank you for listening to today's Q&A show. I am grateful for your being here. I hope
