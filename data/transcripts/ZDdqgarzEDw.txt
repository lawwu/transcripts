[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [SOUND]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.380]   Welcome back, Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.420]   We're on a little later today because Duncan is basically running a TV studio
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.220]   at our New York headquarters today.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.180]   He's been a busy man, so we're here.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.320]   Remember, if you have a question for us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.360]   Last week, I mentioned a book by a quote by a guy named Myer Stattman,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   who is a behavior psychologist.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.240]   And I mentioned his book, and a bunch of people asked.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   It's called What Investors Really Want, really highly underrated.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.360]   And I kind of forgot about it until I mentioned it last week.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.240]   And I went through, he's got a ton of these little anecdotes that I've
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.400]   never really heard on other books before.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.080]   So I wanted to go on.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.580]   He found this book called Watch Your Margin.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.680]   An Insider Look at Wall Street in 1930 from an anonymous trader,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.360]   which is great, perfect title for today.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.520]   But in the book, he gave a back and forth between two guys.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.680]   And one of the guys said, why do people speculate in stocks?
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.520]   And the other guy said, well, of course, to make money.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.920]   And he said, no, no, not at all.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.760]   They do it because they want a thrill.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.520]   That is why we drink bootleg whiskey.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.720]   This was written in Prohibition.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   Kiss girls and take new jobs.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.000]   We want thrills.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200]   It's perfectly human.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.240]   But Wall Street is a poor place to look for thrills for
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.700]   the simple reason that thrills in Wall Street are very expensive.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.340]   Kind of funny how that's sort of, it's as old as the hill,
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.900]   Sunken, as they say, speculation, right?
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.140]   >> Yeah, no, I mean, yeah.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.660]   That's quite a throwback to bring up Prohibition, yeah.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.020]   >> All right, yeah, what investors really want.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.780]   That's a good one.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.380]   All right, first question.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.300]   >> Okay, first today we have one that people might recognize from what are your
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.580]   thoughts, but we're gonna dig a little deeper into it today.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.940]   So there's still lots here.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.900]   I have a question for
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.940]   all the people who have had respectable gains in cryptocurrencies.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.800]   I got into crypto during the COVID crash and I've had some great gains.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   Some of my trades were Bitcoin at 8,500 and Ethereum at 1,300.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.220]   However, I started with a 10% allocation to cryptocurrencies,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.720]   which grew to 20%, and I didn't change it.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.560]   Then it went from 20 to 30, and I trimmed it to 20.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   And long story short,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.200]   it just keeps taking on a larger and larger portion of their portfolio.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.240]   So they wanna know, should they stick to their plan and trim back their allocation,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.880]   or let their winners run and only allocate into stocks and bonds from here on out?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.080]   >> Yeah, this was a question that we received, obviously, towards the peak.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   So that 50% is probably, I don't know, 30% now,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.120]   depending on what else they're investing in.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.840]   Obviously, this stuff is much easier to do when stuff is going to the moon.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.560]   Now, Bitcoin and Ethereum, I think, are both down 45%.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.440]   Solana is 60% off its highs.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.080]   So this is the idea of, do I bank on mean reversion, or
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.760]   do I just let my winners ride?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.600]   So I wanna give a little story from my first book about rebalancing.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.040]   And it was a study of a prison in the Midwest,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.200]   because I like these flyover states, Duncan.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   And this prison guard was noticing that all the inmates who were there for
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.200]   like six months or less were gaining an average of like 20 to 25 pounds in prison.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.680]   And the guy said, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   Why would people gain weight in prison?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   They have the exercise yard, you can't get access to a ton of food.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.040]   You kinda eat a little bit, but what is it?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.760]   And they figured out the problem was the orange jumpsuits they wear,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.800]   cuz they're really baggy, they don't have a belt.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   And it's not like they're wearing a pair of jeans where they put it on,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   everybody can feel it getting tighter.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   So the reason that they were doing it is cuz they're incrementally gaining weight.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.280]   And they couldn't figure out that they were gaining weight because they had so
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.840]   much extra room.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   They had no benchmark or
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.480]   anything to really let them know that, you're gaining weight.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.880]   And they said, so without these clothes,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.680]   it was hard to tell that they were adding these unnoticed pounds.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.520]   So this is the idea of rebalancing, right?
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.560]   It allows you to avoid parts of your portfolio getting overweight.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   See what I did there, Duncan?
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.200]   >> [LAUGH] >> So I think this is the idea,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.640]   investing is always this form of regret minimization.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.840]   Am I going to regret it if this thing goes to the moon and
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.800]   I sell a little bit too early?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.400]   Or what happens if this thing goes to the floor and I held on to it?
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200]   But let's give a simpler example, let's say at a 60/40 portfolio.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.080]   Ten years ago you started 60% stocks, 40% bonds in the United States.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.800]   Because gains in stocks have been so much more than bonds,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.280]   you'd be at an 85/15 portfolio now.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.680]   Now you'd probably say, great, I did awesome.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.440]   If I would have kept trimming back the whole way through,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   I would have made much less money.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.520]   The other side of that is your losses are going to be bigger now, but
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.920]   why did you create that 60/40 portfolio in the first place?
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.640]   It's like, what's the point of an allocation?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   So there's this difference between having a portfolio and having a plan, right?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720]   Having a portfolio is like, I go to the Golden Corral Buffet, and
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.880]   I grab a little of this, and I grab, that one looks good too, and I want some of that.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.240]   And you put it on your plate, and then you realize, this isn't a meal,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   this is just a bunch of mishmash of foods, and
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.080]   they don't really all go together very well.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   That's a portfolio.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.120]   Plan is like something that's really well thought out.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.000]   You take into account expectations, and probabilities, and you have a process.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And I think if you don't have these rules in place ahead of time
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.480]   to guide your actions, you're always going to be playing catch up to whatever
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.240]   the price is doing.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.480]   So when things are going really well and things are going up,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   you're going to think, I don't want to trim now, what if it keeps going up?
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   Then when things are going down, you're going to go, well,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   I can't buy now, because what happens if things go down further?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.880]   So that's why you need to have a rebalancing policy in place and
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.520]   asset allocation to guide your actions ahead of time.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.840]   Because in the moment, it's going to be so much harder to do.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.920]   Now, could you have a type of buy and hold forever kind of thing for
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   some portion of a portfolio?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.840]   Sure, because there's a buy and hold forever, there's a buy and
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.920]   hold and rebalance, maybe there's a buy and hold and reassess.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.120]   But I think investing is always about trade-offs.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.440]   So especially when you get into concentrated positions,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.080]   it's wonderful on the way up, but so much more painful on the way down.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.520]   So I think you have to find a balance where you set some thresholds in place.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.040]   And every time this position gets to 10% or 20%,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.520]   I'm going to trim a little bit.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.120]   And every time on that way down, it gets to 5% or 10% or whatever it is,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.960]   I'm going to add back.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.120]   And I think if you don't have that discipline in place,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.620]   you're basically just guessing.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.640]   And you're trying to follow the ways of the wind or something.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.320]   And you're putting your finger in the air and going, wait, you have no idea.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   So I think you have to have those guidelines and rules in place.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   Otherwise, you're just going to be lost.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.360]   >> Yeah, no, that sounds like good advice.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.640]   To run with your analogy, if your stocks are kind of like the inmates in that
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.480]   prison, Facebook's a pretty dangerous prisoner today, right?
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.280]   >> Facebook got shanked today, big time.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.680]   >> [LAUGH] >> Oof, that's tough.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.160]   My diversification thing, though, I put this on Twitter this morning.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560]   Facebook is down 24%.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   That's the fifth biggest stock in the S&P 500, down 24% in one day.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.160]   That's basically a Black Monday 1987 crash.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.720]   The S&P, when I looked this morning, was down 1.2%.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.480]   So this is why you diversify, and having a concentrated position like that,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   it's great when Facebook is going up.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   Now I looked at it, Facebook is underperforming the S&P 500 over the last
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.080]   like six or seven years now.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.460]   After all those gains basically wiped out in a matter of hours, I guess.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.160]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.440]   All right, let's do the next one.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.160]   >> Okay, so up next, I'm 38 years old, married with three kids,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.000]   aged five and under, and I have five 29s for each.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.520]   And a take home salary of $400,000 in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.760]   Primary home is 1.5 million, just moved in, and
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.200]   we're house poor at the moment, maybe forever.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.560]   Neighbors, I feel like this is kind of a stream of consciousness, but
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   neighbor's house on the block is going for 900,000, and it's a rental gold mine,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   consistently rented for the last ten plus years.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.000]   I'd like to go for it, but need to take out about 500,000
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.120]   of my 401(k) to make the rental cash flow positive.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.840]   Do I stay the 401(k) course, or YOLO this rental property?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.960]   I like YOLO being a verb there.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   >> Yeah, you're gonna be surprised here, but
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.480]   I don't think I would ever use YOLO as a part of financial advice.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.520]   That's never really reasonable.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.200]   I understand the idea here, like, have someone else pay for your mortgage,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.120]   the equity's going up, Austin is this really hot housing market,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.240]   like how can you lose?
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   Pull up this Austin chart here, Duncan.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.960]   Let's do a chart on for Austin over the last year.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.480]   Housing, this is from Zillow, the average housing price in Austin is $625,000.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.160]   It's up 40% over the last year,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.840]   it's basically one of the hottest housing markets in the world.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.480]   We pulled some data from apartmentdata.com that shows rent year over year
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.760]   up 25% in Austin.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.640]   The months of inventory in the Austin real estate market is like 0.8,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.560]   which is well, well under the rest of the country,
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.360]   which is having a short of its own.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.480]   So you probably think to yourself, everyone wants to come here,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.760]   all these people are leaving Silicon Valley and all these other places and
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.000]   moving to Austin, like it's this great place, it makes sense.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.600]   And so you think, well, I don't have this concentrated,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.480]   because that's the big problem, right?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.520]   You have concentration risk, you're two biggest assets on the same block.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.760]   What happens if the, forget the national market,
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.120]   the local real estate market, their slows or the local economy,
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.840]   for whatever reason, slows.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.640]   No, you say, whatever, Austin's going to be hot forever.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.880]   Sure, you might be right, it's going to be the new Silicon Valley.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.120]   But, like, what happens if something happens to the house, right?
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.960]   You need a new roof, you need a new air conditioner, a new water heater.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.640]   There goes like months of profit, potentially.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.520]   And the other problem is you can't spend your house, right?
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.440]   You could take out some home equity line of credit.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.720]   And honestly, if this person came to us and said, listen,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.200]   I've got a ton of equity in my current home.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.320]   I want to use some of that real estate equity, it's just sitting there.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   I'm going to borrow it and put it for a down payment on this new rental house.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.840]   And that's going to be an investment.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.680]   Then you're essentially shifting the balance sheet from one real estate
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.440]   investment to another.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.120]   That actually makes more sense to me than someone who says,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.240]   I'm already house poor, I'm going to buy another house to be double the house poor.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.720]   I don't know, so put this one up,
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.440]   this chart up about the middle class and their housing.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.640]   Obviously, this person has a $1.5 million house, so
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.520]   maybe they're not middle class.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.640]   But this just shows your real estate portfolio and
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   your primary residence to financial assets.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   So the top 1% has like less than 10% in their primary residence and
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.360]   74% in financial assets.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.560]   There's obviously a bunch of other stuff that's not in here.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.800]   The bottom 80% has 63% of their home and just 5% in financial assets.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   And there's a reason that the top 1% keeps getting richer and richer.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   Obviously, the housing market has been on fire, especially these last 18 months.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.120]   But owning financial assets is probably a better thing for
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   the majority of the population because you can diversify.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.960]   You can do so at a lower cost.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.320]   I'm not even thinking through all the costs involved.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.200]   And what if something did go wrong and you had to sell this rental property?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.120]   All the costs involved in buying and selling it, the closing costs and
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.080]   the realtor fees and all this stuff.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.280]   I know it probably seems like a no-brainer.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.320]   But I just think that you're putting so
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.140]   much risk on this one asset class, on this one block.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.600]   I don't know, I'd have a hard time signing off on this,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.160]   especially if you're gonna pull from your entire 401(k) and
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.400]   you don't just have the money laying around for a down payment or something.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.640]   >> Right, yeah, this kind of goes along with what you were saying on the first
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.400]   question, right, diversification, and yeah, you're kind of putting all your eggs in
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.120]   one basket.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.600]   >> Yeah, it's boring, but I think this person kind of answered their own question
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   when, again, yoloing into a rental.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.680]   I think that, I don't know, again, I can't get my head around that.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.000]   I understand the desire to rent these days and
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.960]   think that the equity's gonna go up so much more.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.300]   Even if they're just covering my mortgage,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.120]   I'm building in that equity, I'm slowly paying it off.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.080]   That makes sense in theory, but
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.320]   this is a very risky proposition as far as I'm concerned.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.680]   >> Yep, sounds like it.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.720]   Okay, so up next, this is kind of a long one, but hang in there.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.280]   We're 45-year-olds living in Ohio earning about $240,000 annually.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.480]   We max out our 401(k) and HSA accounts, have $1.5 million in savings, and
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.120]   our house is paid off.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.880]   No college savings for our two teens, but we plan to pay as they go.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.440]   Maybe that's naive.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.560]   I'm worried I'm too heavily in stocks and stock funds.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   I want to hold the after-tax stock portfolio for five years like a boss, but
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.640]   I'm afraid it'll crater if the Fed raises rates quickly.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   I've already lost $150,000.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.920]   I'm planning to work until 55 and live on one salary because my wife likes to work.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.320]   I just need some guidance on how to reduce risk.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.640]   Am I taking too much?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.680]   Should I stay with the stocks I've picked or migrate to a portfolio?
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.760]   >> There's a lot going on in this one.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.040]   They actually had a lot more information here.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.320]   We had to kind of trim it down a little bit.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.120]   This seems like an investing question.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.880]   And this kind of happens a lot with us at our wealth management practice is people
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.360]   come to us and think that they have a portfolio management question.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.480]   When in reality, they need to talk to a financial advisor.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.080]   So we're going to bring in a financial advisor, Chris Venn,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.160]   who's the head of our wealth management practice.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.200]   Chris has created hundreds, maybe thousands of financial plans over his career.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.360]   >> That's fair. >> Right?
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.880]   So Chris, we got a lot going on here.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   The other one that we didn't put here is they told us that they spend like
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.920]   drunken sailors.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.080]   Even though they're maxing out their accounts,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   everything else they spend like crazy.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.120]   So someone comes to you like this.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.400]   They give you all this information and they say, I don't know what to do.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.680]   Do I need to sell my stocks?
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.600]   What do I do?
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.200]   Where do you start with something like this?
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.400]   >> So first off, this sort of reads like an incomplete CFP case study, right?
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.280]   There's a lot of stuff missing here.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.880]   So giving direct answers to some of these questions is inherently problematic.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.240]   That said, there are a few pieces I picked out of here that they can address like
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.000]   right off the bat.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   To begin with, whether or not the kids are a year or four years away from college,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.160]   there's benefit to them being in an Ohio 529 plan.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.360]   In Ohio, you're able to get $4,000 state tax deduction for
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.760]   each beneficiary that you set up.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.320]   So if there's two kids, that's 8,000 a year, like right off their state taxes.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.920]   The other thing that's like an immediate takeaway, they're 45.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.200]   When we're building financial plans, we're putting it out,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.840]   their lifespan, out to age 100, right?
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.520]   The idea is that we wanna plan for this excessive period of time.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.360]   So to think about lightening up on stocks at 45, that's just silly.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.280]   >> Yeah, so they say we're gonna retire by 50 or 55, but guess what?
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   Your portfolio and your lifespan still goes after that.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   So you're planning your portfolio for not just the day you retire,
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.240]   it's while you're in retirement too, right?
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.720]   >> Yeah, and that's just some of the immediate things that jumped out to me.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.920]   Answering this question, it's not the question they're asking.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.880]   The question they're asking is, I've done well and
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.760]   I'm nervous that the stock market's gone down.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.080]   What they should be asking is, do I need a detailed financial plan?
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.240]   And obviously the answer is yes, right?
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.040]   To be able to contextualize what it is that they're saving for,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.480]   what these various goals that they have to accomplish over half a lifetime, right?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.840]   Like that's the way they should be looking at this,
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.240]   not whether or not during a downturn they should lighten up on stocks.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.840]   That's literally one of the primary value adds that we talk about when building
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.480]   plans for people.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.880]   It's like, you're gonna run into situations that are just gonna make you
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.960]   uncomfortable.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.640]   And if you rely on how you're doing versus the stock market,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.320]   you're gonna get uncomfortable and make the worst decision.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.280]   That's just the way it's gonna go.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.840]   >> And this kinda gets back to the first question about a plan versus
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.560]   a portfolio, right?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.440]   These people have done well, they've accumulated assets.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.080]   They've put together a portfolio.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.160]   >> House is paid off.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   >> Right, yeah, they've done really well personal finance wise.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.760]   Obviously, they save a lot of money.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.080]   They said they spend like drunken sailors too,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.640]   which I think is fine as long as you're saving.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.920]   They're maxing everything out, that's good for them.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.520]   But I think you're right, what they need now, especially, and
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.840]   this happens to us a lot with clients that come to us, right?
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.440]   Is that, I'm approaching retirement, I'm approaching some life event.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.120]   Now, help me put a plan together to figure out what to do with it all now that I
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:57.920]   have it, right?
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.720]   >> And it sounds like their life event is they participated in the bull market and
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.800]   made a bunch of money.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.920]   And it's like, look, I applaud them.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.200]   They point out that they over the past six years have visited 33 national parks.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.160]   That's a really serious financial planning conundrum,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.320]   is getting people to do that kind of stuff and enjoy their life while they can.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.120]   But what you don't want to do is make those decisions at the detriment of your
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.000]   future liabilities, right?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.360]   >> Yeah, so they come to you and they say,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.600]   we want to continue to travel and put this together.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.480]   So it's like build a plan that takes that into account, right?
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.800]   Help our kids pay for college, help us go to all these national parks, and
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.480]   also help us not worry about a portfolio crashing all the time if and when it does.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, that's when you first sent me this question, Ben,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.800]   my immediate response was like, this is literally a commercial for
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.680]   why you need to work with financial planner to think through this stuff.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.360]   It really is.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.880]   I mean, again, just like I cherry picked the example of the 529s and the age, but
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.040]   there's 100 other pieces of this that we could pick apart.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:59.360]   But I really think that the most important takeaway that the question needs to be
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.040]   given as far as an answer is, no, you should absolutely not be thinking about
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.440]   lightening up, but it sounds like they're picking individual stocks.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.400]   And he looks like he's interested in migrating towards some sort of a more
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.760]   diversified approach to invest, and clearly, that's what they should be doing.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.800]   >> Right, all right, Duncan, we got another one?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.720]   >> Yep, so this next one's from Chris, and
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.920]   Chris writes, I'm a 40-year-old government worker at a state hospital in California.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.840]   I have a solid pension that will be worth 2 to 3 million when I retire.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.160]   I max out my 403(b) and 457 and backdoor Roth for 6,000, and
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.840]   they give how much they put into their 403(b) and 457.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   Also have two rental properties that are not in California, and
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.120]   200,000 in brokerages and savings.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.360]   Should my pension be treated like the bonds in my retirement portfolio, and
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   should I put 100% of my other retirement investments in an index fund?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   >> First of all, this person is in a good position, obviously,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   to actually have a pension.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.080]   Not many people have that.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.560]   My brother works for the government.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.040]   I think the only reason he's staying in that job is because he's gonna get
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.120]   a pension in his 50s.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.160]   It really- >> Makes sense.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.520]   >> Yeah, this person put a dollar value on it.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.600]   They didn't tell us how much they're gonna get.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.800]   But how does having that income stream change things if someone comes to you
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.120]   from a financial planning perspective?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.960]   They say, all right, here's my portfolio, and
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.280]   then I have this income stream on top of it.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.000]   What does that do to your ability or need to take risk?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.960]   >> Ben, in 15 years of doing this, anyone I've seen come through the door who's got
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.600]   a pension as part of the financial plan is infinitely more comfortable
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.040]   from their own perspective on their finance.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.440]   It doesn't matter how many millions they have.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.480]   It doesn't matter what else they've gone on.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.920]   Knowing that there's a pension, if it's coming from, if it's a state pension,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.400]   if it's a teacher pension, if it's coming from a solid company.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.360]   Obviously, like you said, there just aren't many of these left.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.280]   So that's a small group of people.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.120]   But for those who are fortunate enough to be in that position,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.200]   it changes the entire game.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.240]   Now, when you're thinking about like bucketing out what that pension serves
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   versus like any other investments you have, the only way to answer that question is
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.840]   to look at it through what your actual need is, right?
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.560]   So if you've covered, if he's covered his basic spending need with a pension,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.520]   that makes everything else a little more creative, right?
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.040]   Like you can look at it from a goal to goal perspective.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.240]   So I don't think it's binary, is what I'm saying.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.960]   I don't think it's, all right, I have the pension figured out.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.320]   Let's like, let's just jam the pedal to the floor with the rest of the stuff.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.040]   - Right, it could mean that you take less risk, right?
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.960]   Because you have that pension, you don't need to take as much risk.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.200]   So it like, it's kind of like both sides, right?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.120]   - It's a matter of looking at through the lens of what do you want to have happen?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.000]   I mean, this is a 40 year old, again, longevity, right?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.680]   If the pension is going to be there to supply the basic living expense,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.400]   and you don't have to, you know, take risks to cover your needs,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.520]   then it's a matter of thinking through what exactly you want to do with the excess
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.120]   before you can answer that question.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.440]   You know, what are the planning needs you're solving for?
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.880]   Not simply, well, this is covered, let's invest in all stocks.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.560]   - Yeah, and does it even open you up to the fact that like,
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.280]   this pension allows me to like, invest for the next generation?
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.600]   Like, you could be taking more risk because, yeah,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.080]   maybe you're investing for years or whatever.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.000]   All right, Chris, we got one question actually from the chat here.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.320]   Casey asks, and this is like asking a barber, do I need a haircut?
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.440]   Casey says like, how do I know if I need a financial planner?
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.360]   Like, what are some of the reasons people come to us
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   because they need help?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.440]   Like, what are some of the main reasons?
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:26.680]   - I think the easiest way to look at that is we're helping people make better decisions.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.520]   You know, we're not here, and we being financial planners universally,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.720]   right, not just at Riddell 12.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   Like, universally, financial planners are there literally to help people make
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.880]   decisions that are not only more well-informed, but without, like,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.240]   all the baggage of that, you know, oh, my God, am I doing the right thing?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.160]   You know, oh, my God, did I just like screw up my future?
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.800]   And that's the lens you have to look at that through.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.600]   Do you have a situation where decisions in front of you are being made, you know,
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.280]   like, either on the fly or really uncomfortably?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.480]   And if that's the case, then absolutely, start talking to someone.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.200]   Why not?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.320]   You know, at least do...
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   I can't think of someone who's going to charge for an initial consultation.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.440]   You know, sit down with the firm that you're comfortable with and, you know,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.680]   see if the questions that you're faced with are actually, you know,
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.600]   of detriment to you in the future.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.680]   So to put that in a box is really difficult, right?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.080]   To say, well, you have to be this age and have this many assets or whatever.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.360]   You know, I just think it's as simple as, are your future decisions or near-term
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.840]   decisions stressing you out to the point where you think you're going to mess
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.920]   something up?
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.760]   - Right, yeah.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.040]   Or do you just want to find a place with expertise in a bunch of different areas
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.800]   that can help you make better informed decisions, right?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.160]   - Yeah, and that's really the value we're bringing is, like, as planners is,
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.200]   you know, hey, I want to make sure, like, these questions here, hey,
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.720]   how should I view my pension in light of the fact that I've also got 457s
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.480]   and 401(k) accounts?
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.560]   Well, what are they for, right?
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.760]   I don't, you know, I don't think it's...
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.800]   I think most of these decisions aren't binary.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.600]   - Do the flows of inquiries go up with market volatility, typically,
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.080]   for financial advisors?
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.880]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.000]   - I think especially from people who have advisors that don't have a plan,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.160]   like we see that, and also people who have been doing it themselves and they go,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.920]   "Okay, I've amassed enough wealth that I don't want to mess this up now and I don't
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.200]   have as much time as I used to have," right?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.960]   Like, those are the things that we definitely see.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.120]   - And that's true at any asset level.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.440]   You know, I've heard all too often people with significant amounts of money,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.520]   "Oh, I don't need a financial plan."
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.280]   Well, what do you mean?
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.720]   You've got everything figured out.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.760]   You know the direction of all of these assets as long as your lifestyle is
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.260]   covered.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.880]   Like, that's 99% of the time when you turn that question around on someone,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.280]   it's like, "Well, no, I didn't think of that."
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.780]   - Yeah.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.340]   I mean, like, if it's not fun anymore, right?
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.400]   Like, my Robin Hood's no longer fun, you know?
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:40.900]   - Yeah.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.660]   - It used to be fun, and now it's not.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.140]   - Duncan needs a consultation, Chris.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.780]   All right.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.340]   Next week, we are off.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.740]   I'm taking the family, my wife, three kids, the in-laws, all going to Disney.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.700]   Duncan, you're a Disney guy, what are my tips here?
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.580]   - Oh, I mean, I always like the pools.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.540]   I'd hang out at the pools.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.260]   Epcot, World Showcase.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.700]   - Yeah, a pool sounds great to me.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.140]   Yeah, I'd much rather be in a pool than waiting in line all day.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.620]   Remember, if you have some thoughts on any of the questions here today,
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.300]   leave a comment for us on YouTube, have a question for the show,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.900]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.920]   Duncan, are we doing a ticker yet for 100,000 subscribers?
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.300]   Like, the national debt level in the country?
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.540]   - Yeah, we're getting real close.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.340]   We're getting real close.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.620]   But, yeah, share with your friends.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.900]   Let's get to 100,000.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.760]   - If you liked Chris's compound hoodie today, go to idontshop.com.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.460]   Again, we're off next week.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.780]   I'm in Disney.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.380]   I'm going to be waiting in lines.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.260]   It's going to be hot and sticky.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.340]   I just can't wait, Duncan.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.100]   We'll be back in two weeks.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.060]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.560]   - See ya.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.880]   you
