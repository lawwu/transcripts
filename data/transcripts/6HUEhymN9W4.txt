[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   [Music]
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.600]   An important question here from a listener named Candice on the topic of proxy baptisms in Mormon practice.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   "Pastor John, I've been sharing my faith with a few Mormon friends,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.500]   and I'm deeply concerned for their souls and for their theology.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.900]   As many have already discovered, the teachings, history, and doctrines of the Latter-day Saints are alarming,
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.200]   a far cry from authentic biblical Christianity.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.700]   So far, I've made it clear to them from Scripture that the Mormon God and the Mormon Jesus are very different from the God and Jesus of the Bible.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600]   Their pathway to salvation is works-based,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.000]   and their assertion about the legitimacy of doing work for the dead seems horribly off and rancid.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.100]   However, I don't know how to navigate a conversation on this subject,
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.200]   particularly baptism for the dead as it's mentioned in verse Corinthians 15, 29.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.300]   Can you guide me through how you would address this verse?"
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500]   Well, it sounds to me like Candice may be ahead of me.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600]   [Laughter]
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.000]   I don't—I have never gone very deep into Mormon thinking,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   but let me try to say something helpful just in general,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.200]   and then maybe about that particular issue of how they relate to the dead.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.500]   It is very difficult to interact about the intricacies of doctrine
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.400]   with someone who is operating from a different source of authority,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.700]   as the Mormons are when they add revelation to the Bible.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.700]   You feel frustrated because it seems like you have to become an expert in their sources
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.700]   in order to make any headway when you don't believe those sources are valid.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.500]   So, I think at some points, the average believer in the sufficiency of Scripture
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.700]   must simply say, "I don't think that's taught in the Scriptures,"
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.400]   and believing it leads to some dangerous outcomes according to the Scriptures,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.300]   and then just leave it at that.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.200]   Baptism for the dead is a part in the Mormon thinking,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   a part of a web of beliefs about ancestors and about posterity in the Roman—
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.700]   I mean, the Mormon Church.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.900]   The Church says—here's a quote from an official site, website—
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.200]   "Through the power of the priesthood, members are married for time and eternity
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.500]   and perform proxy baptisms for their ancestors
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   who died without enjoying the blessings of this saving ordinance."
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.100]   Now, that sentence contains at least three pretty serious errors, I think.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.800]   From a biblical standpoint, Jesus says that in the age to come,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.300]   there'll be no marrying or giving in marriage because we'll be like angels.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.200]   And the point there was not merely that there won't be any new marriages,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   but that the ones enacted on earth won't have the same validity
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.100]   because he was addressing the problem raised by marriage on the earth,
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.800]   namely having multiple spouses because they died
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.500]   and it seemed like there were going to be polygamists in heaven.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.900]   And he says, "No, it won't be like that at all because there won't be any marriage there."
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.500]   So there's a serious issue with the whole construct of the way marriage is viewed.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.400]   Secondly, calling baptism a saving ordinance in their context
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.200]   seems to carry implications that it does not carry in the New Testament.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.300]   When 1 Peter 3.21 says, "Baptism now saves you,"
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.200]   which is probably where somebody would run real quickly to defend that phrase "saving ordinance,"
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   he immediately—Peter immediately qualifies the statement by saying,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.100]   "I don't mean that the ritual itself and the water going over the body does the saving,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.100]   but rather the act of faith appealing to God for a good conscience
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.700]   is what does the—it's the instrument of connecting with Christ who is the salvation."
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:25.100]   So I think there's a serious problem about the level at which they have ranked the act,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:34.500]   the actual physical act of baptism, which then creates the pressure to do it for the dead.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.900]   This is a really crucial issue.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.300]   Paul is the most forceful New Testament spokesman to insist that justification,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:54.700]   a right standing with God, is based on faith apart from works of the law, Romans 3.28.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   And those works of the law, apart from them—faith is the instrument of salvation or justification—
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.600]   apart from those, those works would include all the performances of ritual duty.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.300]   That's the kind of thing Paul was constantly wrestling with,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.100]   with circumcision and days and months and seasons and so on.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.000]   So baptism has a crucial place in the demonstration
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   and the symbolic reenactment of the spiritual death and spiritual burial and resurrection
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.600]   that takes place in faith, but not—it's not a saving act in and of itself,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:42.800]   which also means that if a person truly believed in Christ the way the thief on the cross did
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.300]   just before he died and through no rebellion of his own failed to be baptized,
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.400]   that physical act would not be required for his eternal salvation.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.100]   When Jesus said to the thief on the cross, who was never baptized
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.700]   because he just believed and then died on the cross,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.600]   when he said, "Today you will be with me in paradise,"
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.100]   the word "today" is meant to signify, I think,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.600]   that he is safe in fellowship with Christ from now on.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:28.000]   It would be a huge and I think unwarranted stretch to say that baptism would now need to intervene
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   after he died by some later posterity of which he didn't have any,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.400]   who were Christian or became Christian as far as we know.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.900]   So the pressure that Mormons feel to provide proxy baptism now for those who have died
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.300]   is based on, I think, a dangerous misunderstanding of how salvation works,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.700]   how it relates to faith and how it relates to works,
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.000]   and Kandis seems to have a good handle on that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.600]   There is a real concern on the part of Mormons,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.800]   and we should share it, that God must be just in his dealings with those who have died
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.300]   and did not hear the gospel before they died.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.200]   Now Paul's answer to that question,
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:31.500]   that the justice of God in the situation where people have died before the gospel reaches them,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.600]   his solution to that, his answer to that is not to say,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.500]   "Oh, God will provide opportunities beyond the grave for them to hear the gospel and be baptized after they die."
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.300]   That's not Paul's solution.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:53.400]   Paul's solution to the justice of God is to say they won't be judged for not believing the gospel
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   if they never heard the gospel.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.500]   They'll be judged for suppressing and not embracing the truth about God that they knew and had.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.200]   That's Romans 1, 18 to 23.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.700]   "Therefore they are without excuse," he said,
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.300]   "and therefore they're going to come into wrath and judgment,"
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.200]   not because they scorned the gospel, which they never heard,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.000]   but because they scorned the knowledge of God, which they all had,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.700]   and suppressed the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   The New Testament simply does not hold out to those who die without believing the gospel
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:38.700]   the possibility that someone on the earth can do something that would secure the possibility of their salvation after they've died.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:46.000]   In fact, Jesus said in Luke 16, 26, when he was talking about the man who had died unbelieving,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.500]   "A great chasm is fixed between those who have died and those who are in heaven,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   and none can cross it or do anything to bring about the cessation of the torment that they are in."
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.300]   So when we come now, finally, to 1 Corinthians 15, 29,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   where Paul asks the rhetorical question about why people are baptized for the dead,
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:27.000]   there is little reason, I would say no good reason, to think that Paul himself believed this practice was warranted.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.500]   The context is that he's arguing for the physical resurrection of Christians who have died,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   and he's being opposed by people who say there is no such thing.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   For example, verse 12 of 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   "Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   And one of the arguments he uses against those who are opposing the doctrine of the physical resurrection of the believer from the dead,
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   one of the arguments he uses against them is their apparent inconsistency between, on the one hand, denying the resurrection,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   and on the other hand, being baptized for the dead.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   So he asks, in verse 29, "What do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead?
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?"
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   Now, that is no statement that Paul agrees with what they're doing.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:40.300]   He's simply pointing out the inconsistency of claiming not to believe in the resurrection and then trying to be baptized.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.500]   That's the way he uses it, being baptized for the dead.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   So, given everything else that Paul teaches, and that the New Testament teaches about our future destiny hanging on our life of faith and obedience here on the earth, not later,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   I take 1 Corinthians 15, 29 not to be Paul's commendation of baptism for the dead,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   but his pointing out that his adversaries perform this act and are inconsistent in doing so.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   So my suggestion to Candace is that she stay close, which she's already doing, it seems to me,
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   she stay close to the center of biblical teachings on justification by faith and the sufficiency of the scriptures to provide everything she needs for life and faith and godliness,
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   and so not to be entangled in a web of teachings that in the end really do undermine the glory of Christ's finished work and undermine the gospel of justification by grace alone, through faith alone,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   on the basis of Christ alone to the glory of God alone.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   Amen. This is a very good model, by the way, of using first things to discern secondary matters of concern when it comes to church practice and theology.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   And thank you for the question, Candace.

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   Well, if we get eternity with Christ, if we get eternity in the presence of Christ, what is the draw of all the other eternal rewards that are offered to us in scripture?
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500]   It's a good question.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.500]   And it's on the table for Monday.
