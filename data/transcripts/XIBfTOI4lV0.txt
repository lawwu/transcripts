[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.780]   Well, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.760]   What a privilege it is to be here today and to accompany you all as you sing.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.840]   I've asked Kristen to read two verses from God's Word, and then we're going to respond
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   by filling this room with harmony and singing the songs of heaven.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.360]   And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb saying, "Great
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.120]   and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God, the Almighty.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.920]   Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.800]   Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name?
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.680]   For you alone are holy.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.720]   All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   Let's stand.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:36.920]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:57.720]   Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:06.860]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:26.860]   Holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:52.200]   world as we sing, cherubim and seraphim, all who come before thee, who were and are
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.500]   to come before thee.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:17.200]   Holy, holy, holy, though the darkness hide thee, though the eye of sin foment, thy glory
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   may not see, holy thou art, holy, there is none beside thee, perfect in power, in love
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   and purity.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all thy works shall praise thy name, in earth and
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   sky and sea.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   crowns around the world as we sing, cherubim and seraphim, all who come before thee.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Reaching out to those in darkness, I call to war, to love the captive soul, not to rage
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   against the captor, and with the sword that makes the wounded whole, we will fight with
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   the Lord, and Christ will have the prize for which he died, an inheritance of nations.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   crowns around the world as we sing, cherubim and seraphim, all who come before thee.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   Hear and come, with strength in every strife, give grace for every hurdle, that we may run
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   with faith to win the prize of servant good and faithful.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   Let saints of old still line the way, retelling trials of His grace.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   We hear and call, and hunger for the day, when through Christ we stand in glory.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Speak, O Lord, as we come to you, to receive the food of your holy word.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   Speak in your truth, and in deep in us, shape and fashion us in your likeness, that the
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   light of Christ might be seen today in our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your lowly.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   Teach us, Lord, full obedience, holy reverence, true humility.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your purity.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see your majestic love and authority.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   Words of power that can never fail, let their truth prevail over unbelief.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds. Help us grasp the heights of your pleasure for us.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   Truths found and shaped from the dawn of time that will echo down through eternity.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   And by grace we'll stand on your promises, and by faith we'll walk as you walk with us.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   Speak, O Lord, till your church is built, and the earth is filled with your glory.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Speak, O Lord, till your church is built, and the earth is filled with your glory.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Well, good morning. Good morning, men.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   And thank you so much to Keith and Kristen Getty for leading us in worship through song.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   What a blessing they have been to the church, and just such a joy to hear you men singing those great hymns of praise to our Savior.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Please take your Bibles and turn to Acts chapter 20. Acts chapter 20.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   My assignment this morning is to consider the connection between missions and pastoral training.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   Between missions and pastoral training, the raising up of the next generation of faithful leaders,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   specifically through formal training in pastoral training centers, Bible institutes, and seminaries.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   The connection between all of that and missions.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   To consider that topic, we're going to look at the example of the Apostle Paul in Acts chapter 19 and in Acts chapter 20.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   And I'd like to begin this morning by reading a section of Paul's address to the Ephesian elders in Acts chapter 20, verses 28 to 35.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   This will be where our message will conclude this morning, but I'd like to begin by reflecting on this text.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   There Paul tells the Ephesian elders at Miletus, "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   For I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock, and from among your own selves.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   There will be men who arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Be watchful, therefore, remembering how night and day, for a period of three years, I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among those who have been sanctified.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   You yourselves know how these hands ministered to my own needs and to those who were with me,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   for in everything I showed you that by laboring in this manner you should help the weak.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   And remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   In the year 1559, it was June of that year, John Calvin and his fellow ministers dedicated a new building in the city of Geneva.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   It was a building that had been constructed specifically for the purpose of education,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   and part of that building was used to actually train young people,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   but a primary purpose of that building was to continue the work of training pastors,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   something which John Calvin and his fellow ministers were deeply committed to.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   That building became known as the Geneva Academy.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   There are some historians who, looking back on the Reformation, might accuse someone like John Calvin of not being very missions-minded
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   because his ministry was focused primarily on Geneva, but that would not be accurate.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   Calvin was a Great Commission Christian,
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   and he fulfilled that Great Commission primarily by training the refugees who came from all over Europe to Geneva,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   fleeing persecution, and there under Calvin's tutelage and his fellow ministers in Geneva,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   through the Geneva Academy, these men were trained and then sent back to the nations from which they had come.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   We know from the register of the consistory, which was the church council there in Geneva,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   of at least 88 names of men who were trained in Geneva and then sent back home.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   And yet the reality is, scholars estimate, that there were hundreds more whose names were not recorded
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   because it was simply too dangerous, their ministry was too risky to actually publish their names.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   In the 1560s, it's estimated that there were more than 2,000 Protestant Reformed churches in France alone,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   and most of those churches were pastored by men who had been trained under Calvin in Geneva.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   Calvin's academy in Geneva earned itself the nickname "The School of Death."
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   I'm thinking about using that at the Master's Seminary.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   The School of Death, but not because the curriculum was so hard or the professors were so unrelenting,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   but instead because, although the curriculum was rigorous and the professors did hold a high standard,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   after those men were educated and deployed, the places to which they went were so dangerous
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   that they were risking the very real possibility of persecution, imprisonment, and in some cases, even martyrdom.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   And yet through this approach, John Calvin sent pastors to places like Poland and Holland and England and France.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   Three centuries after Calvin's academy, in the year 1855, there was a man named Thomas Medhurst
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   who wanted to study theology, and he began meeting with his local church pastor to do so.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   That engagement was so enticing to other men in the congregation that soon there was a group of men.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   And in just a few years, Charles Spurgeon found himself teaching an entire pastor's college.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   By the time he died in 1892, over 900 men had graduated from Spurgeon's pastor's college.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   And the results were exponential. Over 200 churches were planted in England.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   But even more than that, although Spurgeon's ministry was focused on London and on Britain,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   graduates of Spurgeon's pastor's college went all around the world.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   They took the gospel to every continent on the globe, with the exception of Antarctica.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   These examples serve as historic illustrations of the connection between pastoral training and missions.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   And of course it should not be surprising to us that there is such a connection,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   because of course the Great Commission involves the advancement of the church,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   and faithful churches need faithful leaders.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   And so training and proper preparation is of course required.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   But the question before us this morning is, is there a biblical precedent for that kind of training?
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   Is there somewhere in the New Testament where we see something equivalent to a pastoral training center or even a seminary?
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   I would argue that there is, and it's found in Acts chapter 19, just one chapter earlier.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Acts chapter 19, specifically in verses 8 through 10 of that particular text.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   And what may seem to us as almost a parenthetical comment by Luke as he records Paul on Paul's third missionary journey,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   is actually a very important part of the development of Paul's missionary work.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   And as we will see, it would have exponential impact.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   In Acts chapter 19, Paul finds himself, as I mentioned, on his third missionary journey in Ephesus.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   In verses 1 through 7, he encounters some former disciples of John the Baptist.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   He introduces them to the one to whom John pointed, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   And then in verse 8, Luke records that Paul entered the synagogue.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   And he continued to speak out boldly regarding the gospel for a period of three months.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   He was reasoning and persuading with them in the synagogue regarding the kingdom of God.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   And we imagine that Paul's messages over those three months were very similar to how he preached in the synagogue of Antioch of Pisidia
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   on his first missionary journey in Acts 13.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   How he used the Old Testament to show those Jewish congregants that Jesus is the Messiah to whom the prophets pointed.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   How he explained the historic truths of the gospel.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   That Jesus lived a perfect life, that he died a substitutionary death on the cross,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   and that he rose again in victory and has ascended to the Father's right hand.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   And then I'm sure Paul continued by explaining the implications of that truth,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   even as he did in Acts 13, 38 and 39, where he explains that through faith in Christ,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   you can have what the law of Moses could never give you, forgiveness and justification.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   For three months, this is Paul's message in the synagogue in Ephesus.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   And in addition to those 12 disciples of John the Baptist who are now disciples of Jesus Christ,
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   we can only imagine that there were many more who were saved through Paul's ministry.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   And yet, verse 9, there is opposition.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   "When some were becoming hardened, when they were no longer willing to listen, they were not believing," Luke says.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   "They began to speak evil of the way."
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Paul withdrew, he took the disciples with him, and he began reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   Encountering opposition and conflict, the Apostle Paul takes these new believers,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   at least a dozen of them, probably many more, maybe two, three dozen men,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   and he begins to disciple them on a daily basis in this lecture hall belonging to some local lecturer,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   a man named Tyrannus, which of course means tyrant.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   It's interesting to think about that lecture hall where Paul met daily with these disciples.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   When would Paul have had access to it?
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   We don't know if he rented it or if it was given to him,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   but it seems based on the climate of Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   where business operated in the cool of the morning or in the cool of the evening,
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   that Paul likely would have had access to this lecture hall in the middle of the day,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   in the warm hours of the early afternoon.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:06.200]   In fact, there is a 4th century scribal note in a manuscript of the Western text
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   that actually suggests that Paul had access to this lecture hall from the 5th hour to the 10th hour.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   If sunrise represents hour one around 6 a.m.,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   the 5th hour to the 10th hour would have been from around 11 a.m. to around 4 p.m.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   If that scribal note is even close to accurate,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   that means that Paul would have had access to this lecture hall for roughly five hours a day
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   to meet with these students, and Luke says daily, so we can assume perhaps five to six days a week.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   That's 25 to 30 hours of instruction from Paul to these disciples.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   And look at what Luke says in Acts 19, verse 10, "This took place for two years."
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   If we're even close to estimating the amount of time that Paul invested in these students,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   30 hours a week for two years, that's over 3,000 hours of instruction.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   I'm making the case this morning that the school of Tyrannus,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   which became the lecture hall of Paul,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   sets a precedent for seminary training, for pastoral training,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   for the intentional and formal investment and preparation of men
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   who represent the next generation of spiritual leadership in the church.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   And look at then the impact of this training center here in Ephesus.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   Luke continues in verse 10 to tell us that as a result of this,
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   all who were in Asia--that's a reference to Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey--
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   all who were in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   This was exponential impact.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Because as Paul trained up these men, he sent them out.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   Commentators believe that Epaphras, for example, who went and planted the church in Colossae,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   was likely trained here in Ephesus under Paul at the school of Tyrannus.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   Others suggest that all seven of the seven churches of Revelation,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   except for Ephesus, the other six were planted by men
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   who trained under Paul here at the school of Tyrannus.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   And even in Ephesus itself, if we were to look a little bit farther down
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   in verse 21 and following in Acts chapter 19,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   we would find that even in Ephesus itself,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   this training is having massive impact.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   So much impact that so many people are becoming Christians
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   that the local economy is suffering.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   Not because Christians cause the economy to suffer,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   but because Christians don't buy idols.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   And when you're a silversmith making idols,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Christianity hurts your pocketbook.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   This seminary was, or this training center,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   was, as I mentioned, founded by Paul on his third missionary journey.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   I'm going to propose that maybe we can call it the Third Missionary Seminary,
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:50.200]   or TMS for short.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   Now the question I want us to --
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   that may have been a little bit of eisegesis.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   The question I want us to consider as we continue thinking about this connection
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   between missions and pastoral training is the focus of Paul's training.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   The focus of Paul's training.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   We can certainly speculate as to what the curriculum was
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   in terms of the instruction that Paul gave.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   While he was in Ephesus on his third missionary journey,
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   Paul wrote 1 Corinthians.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   And so likely all of the topics addressed in 1 Corinthians
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.200]   were things he discussed with the men at the school of Tyrannus.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   He also wrote 2 Corinthians.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   And so those same truths, even the heartaches of ministry,
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Paul likely talked about with his disciples there in Ephesus.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   Shortly after leaving, he would write the book of Romans.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   So even that truth is probably all part of the curriculum
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   that Paul imparted to his students as he met with them daily in this school.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   We know a little bit more from Acts 20 that Paul will say,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   "I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole purpose of God."
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   And it's in Acts 20, as we continue to think about
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   the focus of Paul's pastoral training here at this school in Ephesus,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   that I think we gain even more insight into, again,
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   the connection between pastoral training and missions
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   and really what it is that God calls us to do
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   as we seek to raise up the next generation of faithful leaders.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   After the riot in Acts 19, Acts 20, verse 1, Paul leaves Ephesus.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   He goes across the Aegean Sea to Macedonia.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   He visits the Philippians. He goes down to Greece.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   He spends three months in Corinth.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   He then goes back to Macedonia and then back across the Aegean Sea.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   And in Acts 20, verses 6 through 12, he finds himself in Troas.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   It's there in Troas, late at night, that Paul is speaking in a upper room.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   He's going long. He's at a shepherd's conference.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   And you have a young man named Eutychus there sitting in the windowsill,
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   and Eutychus just can't stay awake.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Some of you know how Eutychus feels even this morning.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Thank you, brothers, for praying for me.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   I'm assuming that's what you're doing.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   And, of course, it didn't end well for Eutychus until it did end well
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   because Paul, of course, came and raised Eutychus back to life.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   And then Paul and his traveling companions, including Luke and Timothy,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   they make their way further south.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   Paul wants to see his brothers in Ephesus one more time.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   He wants to see the students into whose lives he had poured so much time
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.200]   and so much energy.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   But he needs to get to Jerusalem, and he wants to get there quickly.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   He wants to get there in time for the Feast of Pentecost,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   and so he doesn't want to stay in Ephesus.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   And so he sails past Ephesus, and he comes to Miletus.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   And in Miletus, he sends for the Ephesian elders,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   and they meet him in Miletus.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   And starting in verse 18 of chapter 20, Paul addresses the Ephesian elders.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   And this is where we're going to spend our time this morning
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   as we look at Paul's address to his former students.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   In fact, I would argue, insofar as the school of Tyrannus in Ephesus
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   represents the first seminary,
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   that this address by Paul to the Ephesian elders
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   represents the first seminary graduation address.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   This is Paul's charge to his former students,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   because those men who trained at the school of Tyrannus,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   many of them were sent out, but many of them stayed.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   And the men who stayed were trained up to be elders
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   and leaders in the church in Ephesus.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   And so as we reflect on Paul's address to the Ephesian elders,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   this is Paul giving the first graduation charge.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   And it is particularly poignant because Paul tells them,
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   verse 25, that they are never going to see him again this side of heaven.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   His training is complete in terms of his instruction to them,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   and now it's time for them to take what they've learned
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   and to employ it in ministry.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   Now, like a good graduation address,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   Paul will spend half of this address looking back
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   on what it was like when he was with them,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   and he'll spend the other half looking forward
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   as he instructs them to be faithful in the future.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   Commencement is both an end and a beginning,
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   and that's true here for Paul with his former students.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   This is the end of their training.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   It's the beginning of the rest of their ministry,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   where Paul will not be physically present,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   and yet they have been well-prepared, well-equipped.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   These verses, verses 18 to 35,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   Luke's record of Paul's address there to the Ephesian elders,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   they can really be divided into two big categories.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   First, Paul's example in verses 18 to 27,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   and then Paul's exhortation in verses 28 to 35.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   Paul's example, and then Paul's exhortations.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   Last night here at the Shepherd's Conference,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   we had a prospective student event,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   and it was wonderful, just a joy to meet men
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   whose hearts are on fire to serve the Lord.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   And there was a young man last night
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   who asked me this question.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   I don't know if that was apropos.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   He said, "What are the seminary's expectations
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   for its graduates?
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   What are your expectations for your graduates?"
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Well, I was ready for that question
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   because I've been thinking about this passage.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   So maybe I can give you an idea of the answer I gave him
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   based on what comes next in our message this morning.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   But I really think here we have Paul
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   expressing his expectations for his graduates.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   After 3,000 potentially hours of apostolic instruction,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   of seminary on steroids, these men are ready.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   Now Paul is charging them with his expectations
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   of what they must be and what they must do.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   And in particular, as he reflects on his example,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   he's going to emphasize the character
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   that they must display.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   And then as he gives exhortations,
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   he's going to emphasize the convictions
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   that they must possess.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   Character and convictions.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   And what I think is so interesting about this,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   because this is Paul's final lesson,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   or at least his final in-person lesson
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   to these former students here at Ephesus,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   he knows they have the content.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   He knows they have the information.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   He knows they have the theology.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   They have the head knowledge.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   He doesn't spend his time now
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   talking about information or methodology.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   He spends his time instead focusing on
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   character and convictions.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   Because he assumes that if they're men of character,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   they will stay faithful to the truth.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   And if they are men of conviction,
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   they will live out that truth
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   in a way that is consistent
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   with being a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   So let's talk then about Paul's example of character
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   in verses 18 to 27.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   Paul begins by noting the fact that
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   the whole time he had been with them,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   while he was in Asia, this is verse 18,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   then verse 19, that he had been serving the Lord.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   And this gets to our first sub-point under character,
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   and that is Paul's mindset for ministry.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   His mindset was a mindset of service.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   His motivation was a motivation of service.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   In fact, while Paul was with these Ephesians,
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   while he was meeting with them daily
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   in the school of Tyrannus,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   when he was writing 2 Corinthians,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   did he not say to the Corinthians,
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   "We make it our ambition, whether at home or absent,
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   "to be pleasing to Christ."
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   And here we see Paul living that out,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   that he had come to Asia Minor and to Ephesus,
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   and they themselves knew that Paul's heart for them
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   was a heart of serving the Lord.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   And that service to the Lord
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   manifest itself in three specific ways,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   as it says there in verse 19.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   It was serving the Lord with all humility,
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   and with tears, and with trials.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Trials that had come upon him through the plots of the Jews.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   I can't help but think of what Paul said
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   in 2 Corinthians 11, again, written right around this time,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   where Paul outlines all of the things that he suffered,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   being beaten innumerable times,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   and scourged, and shipwrecked,
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   and imprisoned, starving, and cold,
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   and yet he says at the end of all of it,
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   it was the care of the churches
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   that was the real weight on his soul.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   And even in chapter 12, the thorn in the flesh.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   And here Paul says to these Ephesian elders,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   "Hey, remember, when I was with you,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   "my mindset was a mindset of service,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   "and it was selfless service."
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   That's what humility is.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   "And it was sincere service."
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   That's what the tears represent.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   "And it was sacrificial service, enduring many trials."
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   I do think it's interesting in this text,
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   I don't think of Paul as a guy who cried very much,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   I think of him as a rough and tough kind of missionary,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   and he certainly was that.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   But you'll notice in verse 19, the word "tears,"
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   and in verse 31, the word "tears,"
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   and in verse 37, the word "tears."
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   There's a lot of crying happening
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   at this graduation ceremony.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   Because this is brotherly affection
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   of lives shared in the foxholes of ministry,
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   the kind of kinship that you men know
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   because you have those kinds of relationships,
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   and Paul looks at these men.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   These men are not some just product of a program.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   These men are his life.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   He's personally invested to the point of weeping
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   for these men.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   Not only is his mindset a mindset of service,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   but you'll notice that his message, secondly,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   his message in verses 20 and 21
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   was a message of convictional courage.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   He says, "I did not shrink back from declaring to you
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   "anything that was profitable,
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   "but in public and from house to house,
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   "I taught you,"
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   and in verse 21, he emphasizes the fact
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   that he was fulfilling the solemn testimony
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   to both Jews and Greeks that God had given him
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   to declare a message of repentance towards God
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   See, Paul had the right mindset,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   and he also had the right message.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   He was on point.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   He was not off script.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   He was speaking courageously.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   He did not shrink back,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   and he was speaking continually
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   in private, house to house,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   in public, in the lecture hall of Tyrannus,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   to everybody, Jews, Greeks,
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   and he was speaking clearly
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   because he knew the message that he must communicate.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   This simple principle alone
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   would save so many seminaries and institutions
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   from going down the wrong path
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   if they would just have convictional clarity
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   with regard to the message that they are to proclaim
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   and the message that they are to instill
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   in the lives of their students,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   and so Paul says, "Remember, my mindset
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   "was a mindset of humble service.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   "My message was a message of convictional clarity
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   "aimed at the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   Thirdly, verses 22 to 24, Paul's mission.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   It was a mission of enduring obedience,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   a mission of enduring obedience.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   In verses 22 and 23,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   Paul talks about the fact that he's on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   He's bound in the Spirit, on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   He doesn't know what's going to await him there.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   All he knows is that everywhere he goes,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   prophets through the Holy Spirit
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   reveal to him that chains and afflictions await.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   Paul doesn't need to know what's going to happen next
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   to know what his mission is,
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   because verse 24, he says,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   "But I make my life of no account.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   "I do not hold it as dear to myself."
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   Brothers, this is self-denial.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   And Paul says, "I die to myself
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   "so that I might finish the course."
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   That's his mission, that I might finish the course,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   that I might be faithful as a steward
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   to the ministry that I have received
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   from the Lord Jesus himself,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   a ministry that focuses on the declaration
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   of the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   Paul's not confused about his mission.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   He doesn't know what's going to happen to him
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   when he gets to Jerusalem.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   He knows it's probably not going to be a lot of fun for him.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   But he doesn't care, because the mission is everything,
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   and he's ready to serve.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   "I die to myself so that I might finish my course,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   "so that I might complete and finish
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   "the ministry that I have received."
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   It is a stewardship, and Paul is a good steward.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   And here we have, in response to his mission,
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   enduring obedience.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   And then fourth, verses 25 to 27,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   his measure of success, his measure of success.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   Paul's mindset was one of humble service.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   His message was one of convictional clarity.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   His mission, at least in terms of his response,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   was one of enduring obedience.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   And now we have his measure of success,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   in verses 25 to 27.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   In verse 25, he tells them,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   "You are those among whom I preached the kingdom of God,
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   "and now I will no longer see your faces
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   "this side of heaven."
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   This is a true graduation, in the sense of,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   once this service is over, and I get on that boat,
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   I will never see you again until glory.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.200]   And yet Paul's response to that,
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   recognizing their training is complete,
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   his instruction is finished for them,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   in terms of in-person training.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   Verse 26, he says, "But I have a clear conscience.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.200]   "I'm declaring to you that I am innocent
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   "of the blood of all men.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   "My conscience is clear before God."
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   Paul, how can you say that?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   Because, verse 27,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   "I did not shrink back from declaring to you
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   "the whole purpose of God."
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   How did Paul measure success?
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   We already know from Acts 19,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   there were those in Ephesus who rejected the message.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   There were those in Ephesus who rioted
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   because they hated the message so much.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   We know from the subsequent verses here in Acts 20
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   that Paul knows that some of his students will defect.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   We know that to be true from 2 Timothy
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   and other places in Paul's writings
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   that not everyone he trained stayed true.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   So how does Paul measure success?
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   He measures success in terms of courageous faithfulness.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   Courageous faithfulness.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   He did not shrink back,
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   but he was faithful to accomplish his mission,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   which was to declare as a herald the truth
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   with which he had been entrusted.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   Amen.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   There are so many in our evangelical world today
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   who are absolutely and totally confused
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   about God's standard of success.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   There are so many who think that success
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   is measured in terms of numbers,
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   numbers of people on a Sunday,
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   numbers of followers on a social media platform,
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   numbers of likes and subscribes.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   But when you stand before Christ,
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   he's not going to say to you,
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   "Well done, my good and popular servant."
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   I heard one pastor once compare the ministries
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   of Jonah and Jeremiah.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   I thought it was a helpful comparison
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   because if you asked the question,
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   "Who had the more successful ministry,
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   Jonah or Jeremiah?"
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   How would you answer that question?
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   Jonah had more converts.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   Jonah had the numbers.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   Jonah had the results.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   But Jeremiah was faithful.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   And so when we look at Paul's example
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   in these verses, verses 18 to 27,
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   what we see is an example in terms of mindset
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   of humble service,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   an example in terms of his message
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   of clarity and conviction,
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   an example in terms of his mission
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   of enduring obedience,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   and an example in terms of his measure of success,
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   that he measured success in terms of faithfulness
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   to proclaim the truth, not results.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   It was faithfulness to God,
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   and therefore his measure of success
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   was vertical, not horizontal.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Well, that brings us to the passage
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   that we began with this morning,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   verses 28 to 35.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   Paul's exhortations.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   Paul's exhortations.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   As Paul has looked back,
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   he has recounted his example,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   and it is the weight of his faithful example
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   that gives weight to his fervent exhortations.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   And Paul, now having invested,
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   as he will say here,
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   three years of his life,
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   two of which in the school of Tyrannus,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   into these men, his former students,
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   he says to them, "As we look forward,
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   "there are three convictions for ministry
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   "that must define your ministries
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   "if you are to be faithful ministers,
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   "faithful shepherds of the flock of God."
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   What are these convictions?
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   Number one, guard.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   Guard the sheep.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   Verses 28 to 30.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   Paul now shifts the focus from his example
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   and looking back to their faithfulness
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   and looking forward,
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   and he says to them, "You men know a lot.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   "You have good doctrine.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   "I know I trained you.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   "You know what you need to know.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   "The question is, will you be who you need to be?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   "That's character.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   "And now, will you minister in a way that honors Christ?
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   "That's conviction."
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   So number one, guard.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   Guard the sheep.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   "Be on guard for yourselves and for the flock
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   "among whom the Holy Spirit made you overseers
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   "to shepherd the church of God
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   "which he purchased with his own blood."
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   Why are they to guard the sheep?
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   Well, verse 28 gives us two reasons.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   Because of the position in which God has placed them
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   and because of the purchase which God made.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   And of course, verse 28 is one of the clearest testimonies,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   attestations in the New Testament of the deity of Christ
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   because for Paul to say that God shed his own blood
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   is a reference, of course, to our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   God in human flesh.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   Paul's point here is that the church is precious
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   and because the church is precious, so precious to God,
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   that he would sacrifice his own son on her behalf
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   to redeem for himself a people for his own possession
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   and he entrusts that to us.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   He is the chief shepherd.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   We are under shepherds.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   To be honest, even thinking of ourselves as under shepherds
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.200]   and the flock as mere sheep maybe sometimes tempts us
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   to think that we are somehow above the flock.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   We also are sheep.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   Maybe a good illustration would be that we are like sheep dogs.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   We're like sheep dogs.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   We can be useful to the master if we honor the master
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   and if we obey the master,
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   but we are more like the sheep than we are like the shepherd.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   Number of years ago, seven and a half years ago actually,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   around Christmas time, we got our kids a dog.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   Against our better judgment, we did.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   Very, very cute little cocker spaniel puppy
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   and she's still a very cute little dog.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   Other than being a cute little dog, she has no value.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   She is incredibly lazy.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   She just lays around the house all day
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   except in those moments where we accidentally leave
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   the front door open and then she runs into the street.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   So she's lazy but also prone to straying.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   She's scared of everything.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Even when she has people that we know who come over to the house,
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   she runs into the other room leaving a little puddle behind.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   And I kid you not, but even though I know she loves our family,
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   she would trade all of us in a heartbeat for a piece of pepperoni.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   So she's lazy, she's prone to straying,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   she's scared of everything, and she's easily corruptible.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   Men, don't be like my dog.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   I have a friend who works in the canine unit
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   for the Los Angeles Police Department.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   He just got back a few months ago from San Antonio
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   where he was training a police dog.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   Four months of training.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   His dog is way better than my dog.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   Men, that's the kind of sheepdog that we are to be,
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   the highly trained, on guard, ready to act,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   not the lazy, corruptible, easy, distracted, "Oh, I'm cute."
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:02.200]   Paul goes on, "So we are to guard the flock
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   because of the position in which we've been placed
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   and because of the price that was paid for the church."
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   Paul goes on to say that he knows that after his departure,
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   "Even from among your own selves, men will arise,
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them."
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   And this is one of the most sobering texts
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   in all of the New Testament, in my opinion,
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   that Paul, after spending three years with these men,
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   his former students in whom he invested so much,
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   we saw his sacrifice in verses 18 and 19,
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   he's invested his very life in these men,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   and now he tells them that, "I know that even from among you,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   there are going to be those who arise, who lead the sheep astray."
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   And going back up to verse 28, what did Paul say?
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   He says, "Be on guard first." For whom? For yourselves.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   And this is why, because if you are to protect the flock,
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:26.200]   you must first protect your own heart.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   It was Robert Murray McShane who said that,
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   "The greatest need of my people is my own personal holiness."
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   Because when you watch your life and your doctrine closely,
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   as Paul told Timothy, in 1 Timothy 4:16,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   as you watch your life and your doctrine closely,
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   you will be able to save not only yourself,
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   but those under your spiritual care.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   And Paul here recognizes the great threat
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:02.200]   that ministerial failure represents.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   When men defect, when men fail,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   the results are catastrophic for the flock.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   So guard yourselves. Guard yourselves.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   I was having a conversation with a couple of the faculty
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   of the seminary just a couple of days ago,
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   and we were speaking very soberly about examples of men
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   who have graduated from the Master's Seminary
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   and then, to our great sadness,
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   have defaulted morally or defected doctrinally.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   And thankfully, by God's grace,
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   those are in the minority of seminary graduates from our school.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   And yet we look at the Apostle Paul and we recognize
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.200]   that even Paul had men in whom he had invested
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   who did not finish the course,
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   who did not run the race without defaulting and being disqualified.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   You can think of some of the examples in the New Testament.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   Judas is probably the most well-known,
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   who defected for the love of money,
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   or Demas, who defected for the love of this world,
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   or Diotrephes, who defected for the love of self.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:27.200]   Paul has other names on that list, Fijelus, Hermogenes,
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   Philetus, Hymenaeus.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   It's quite likely that those men also trained in Ephesus.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   This is going to date me, but...
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   Do you guys remember motivational posters?
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:54.200]   This is back before internet memes were a thing.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   Motivational posters were like internet memes,
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   except you couldn't swipe them away because they were hanging on the wall.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   And it was a picture of some inspirational picture,
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.200]   and then underneath there was a title and then a slogan.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   And the title and the slogan were supposed to be motivating,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   and they were hung up all across office spaces around the nation
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   in an attempt to entice workers to be excited about their jobs.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   About 20 years ago, I came across some motivational poster parodies.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   There was a company that produced these.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   They're still around. They're called Demotivators.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   And, I mean, it was things like a picture of a gear,
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   and underneath it would say "worth,"
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   and then the caption would read,
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   "Just because you're necessary doesn't mean you're important."
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   One of my favorites was a guy dressed up like he was going to run a marathon,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   but he obviously hadn't done that yet,
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   and he was laying down on a park bench.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   The title was "Procrastination."
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   "Hard work sometimes pays off later, but laziness always pays off right now."
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   I mention those because there was one more that I saw,
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   and this one actually cut me to the quick.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   This one wasn't funny.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.200]   This one was sobering.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   It was a picture of a ship that had obviously crashed into a reef
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   and was now half-submerged in the ocean.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   It was a picture of a shipwreck.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   The title underneath said "Mistakes,"
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   and then the slogan read this,
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   "It may be that the purpose of your life is merely to serve as a warning for others."
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   Men, don't be on that list.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.200]   Guard yourselves.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.200]   Guard your sheep.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   Guard your hearts.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   Guard the truth.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   Finish your course like Paul did,
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   and hear the Savior say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   Well, there's a second conviction in the next verses, verses 31 and 32,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.200]   and that conviction is that we must also guide the sheep.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   This is the positive side.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.200]   Guard the sheep is keep away all of the things that are bad.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   Guide the sheep is lead them in the truth.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.200]   Guard the sheep, verses 28 to 30.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   Guide the sheep, verses 31 and 32.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   And even guiding includes both a negative aspect and a positive aspect.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   The negative aspect, verse 31, be watchful,
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   and remember what Paul had warned you about.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   Remember that I, for night and day, for a period of three years,
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   that I admonished each one with tears, verse 31.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   This is intense.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   Be watchful and avoid error.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:24.200]   And then verse 32, "And now I commend you to God and His Word,
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:33.200]   which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among those who are sanctified."
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   You see, we're not only guard dogs, we're guide dogs for God's people.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   And as we seek to lead the sheep and feed the sheep,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   we are not only to protect them from outside influence,
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   we are to take them to the source of truth.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   So be watchful, verse 31.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   Remember apostolic admonition and warning.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   Does not the entire New Testament warn us about false teachers,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   starting with Jesus in Matthew 7?
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   "Beware of false prophets who come to you dressed in sheep's clothing,
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   Be watchful, be vigilant.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.200]   I love even Paul's personal anecdote,
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   that his pastoral ministry to these students was that which was 24/7,
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   night and day, for a period of three years.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.200]   I did not cease to admonish you and to do it again with tears.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   This is not an academic exercise for Paul.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.200]   This is life.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   And yet, Paul recognizes that he must point them to the truth.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.200]   That ultimately, in Paul's absence, as he leaves them and goes now to Jerusalem,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.200]   that he entrusts them to the care of God and His word.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   The word of grace, which is able to build you up,
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   the source of edification, of spiritual growth,
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   of spiritual nourishment, of spiritual life.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   All that we need for life and godliness is revealed in its pages.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.200]   Men, if you want to be faithful, not only guard the flock from error,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   but also teach them the truth.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   And as you do that, you will edify them and you will ensure for them
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   that they will have a part in the inheritance that is ours in Christ Jesus.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.200]   For we are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   And in Him, we have the hope of eternal life, of forgiveness,
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   and of being in His presence for all of eternity.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   And this is something that is shared among all of those
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   whom He has sanctified through His work on the cross
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   and whom He is sanctifying through His work in the scriptures,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   And one day, who we are positionally and who we are becoming practically
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.200]   will be our reality in both spheres.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.200]   For we will be holy when we see Him.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   For we will be like Him when we see Him as He is.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   And let us not then neglect the work of guiding.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   There's only one true compass, one true source, one true guide.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   It is the Word of God which points to the God of the Word.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.200]   I remember a number of years ago, my family was traveling back
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   from a family camp of vacation in the Rocky Mountains.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   We were at Estes Park, if you know where that is.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.200]   And I put Grand Junction, Colorado in my GPS
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.200]   because that's where we needed to get.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   And it gave me a route that I was very excited about
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   because it was not the route we had come, which was much longer.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   This route was much shorter, and I thought, "This is great.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   GPS has figured out a shortcut."
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   And it was great for about the first three hours,
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   and then we hit the fire road.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.200]   And for about an hour, I was grabbing onto a steering wheel
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   with the widest knuckles you have ever seen
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   as I'm taking my family, all in the back,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   watching probably VeggieTales.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   It's probably not a great example at a Shepherd's Conference.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   Thinking about the danger that I'm putting my family in
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   as we're driving down steep roads with no guardrails,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   on dirt, as it's getting dark.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   I don't know if you know this, but there's actually
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   a Wikipedia entry for "Death by GPS."
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   And what it represents is people who were guided the wrong way.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   We know the right way because we have a sure guide.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.200]   Let us be careful men to always lead our sheep
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   in the right way and to not neglect
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   the truth of God's Word.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:25.200]   Well, there's a final conviction and it's in verses 33 to 35,
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.200]   and that is give.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.200]   Give yourself for the sheep.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   Guard the sheep, guide the sheep,
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.200]   and give yourself for the sheep.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   Verse 33, Paul says, "I didn't covet anybody's clothes
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   "or their silver or their gold."
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.200]   Verse 34, he says, "I worked with my own hands
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   "to supply my own needs."
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   This, by the way, is not Paul saying that every minister
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.200]   has to be bivocational.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   There's other passages of Scripture where he talks
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   about how a laborer is worthy of his wages,
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   how it's appropriate for us to be supported
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   through the work of gospel ministry.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200]   That's not Paul's point here.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.200]   Paul's point here is, "I didn't take advantage of you,
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.200]   "Ephesians."
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   Instead, verse 35, "In everything, I showed you
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.200]   "that by laboring in this manner,
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   "you should care for the weak."
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.200]   You must care for the weak.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.200]   And you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   that he himself said, "It is more blessed to give
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.200]   "than to receive."
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   Men, give yourself to the flock.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   Paul was an example of this.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   He gave his time, his energy, verses 18 and 19.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   He gave them the truth, verses 20 and 21.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   He gave them his very life, verses 22 to 24.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:54.200]   He gave everything, including the whole purpose of God,
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   verses 25 to 27.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   He gave it all.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   He's about to go to Jerusalem to be arrested.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   And I think verse 35, I think we, at least for me,
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.200]   I tend to think of it as a verse about money,
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   and it does have financial implications,
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   but I want to suggest to you men this morning
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   that the statement from Christ, from our Lord,
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.200]   that it is more blessed to give than to receive,
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   is actually, in context, a statement about ministry.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   And some of you men here may be feeling like
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   you've given everything, and you can't give any more,
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   and now it's time to actually give up.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   And I want to challenge you with the truth of this text,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   that there is blessing in giving everything,
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.200]   because you're giving everything for the one
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   who gave you everything.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   David Livingston, the famous missionary explorer to Africa,
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   after more than three decades of fighting danger and disease,
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   more than three decades of work in Africa,
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.200]   he was asked about all the sacrifices that he had made.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.200]   He said, "Don't speak to me of sacrifice.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   "Don't speak to me of sacrifice.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.200]   "It is nothing compared to the debt of gratitude
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   "that I owe to my Savior.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   "Don't speak to me of sacrifice.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200]   "It is no sacrifice.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.200]   "It is privilege.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   "It is privilege."
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   I think the Apostle Paul would have said the same thing.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:41.200]   And so we have here in this first graduation charge
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   a reminder about the kind of character
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.200]   that we are all called to reflect,
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.200]   and a reminder of the kind of convictions
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   that we are all called to implement.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.200]   I want to close with this.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.200]   If we think about Paul's timeline here
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.200]   on his third missionary journey, this was in the mid-50s.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   He probably gave this charge around the year 57.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.200]   If we fast-forward 10 years, around the year 67,
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.200]   Paul is now in the Mamertine prison.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   He's about to die, and he writes a letter to Timothy,
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.200]   his last letter, the letter of 2 Timothy.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.200]   The connection I want you to see
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   is that when Paul writes to Timothy,
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   Timothy is now pastoring in Ephesus.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.200]   Timothy was with Paul on his third missionary journey,
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   was with Paul at Miletus.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   Now Timothy is away from Paul,
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   but Timothy is back in Ephesus,
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.200]   and Paul writes him this final letter.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.200]   And what does Paul emphasize in that letter?
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.200]   He emphasizes guard, right?
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   2 Timothy 1:14, "Guard what has been entrusted to you."
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.200]   And then he emphasizes that the only way
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   that Timothy can lead himself and his people
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   is by continuing on in the Scriptures,
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.200]   chapter 3, verses 14, all the way to chapter 4, verse 5.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.200]   Guide them in the Scriptures.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.200]   And then how does Paul end?
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.200]   He ends by talking about the fact
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:13.200]   that he gave of himself, as a sacrifice, a drink offering.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   Because here he says, "I am finishing my course," in Acts 20,
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   but in 2 Timothy 4, he says, "I have finished my course."
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   And what I think is so amazing
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:35.200]   is that in 2 Timothy 2-2, when Paul says to Timothy,
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   "The things that you've heard from me
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.200]   "in the presence of many witnesses,
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   "entrust these things to faithful men
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   "who will teach others also."
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:59.200]   That's not just a principled statement in abstract.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:05.200]   For Paul and for Timothy, this was very specific.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.200]   And I think Paul was thinking back
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   to those warm summer days in the school of Tyrannus
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   when he poured out his life into the disciples
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   who met with him daily for a period of two years,
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   and he says to Timothy, "Keep it going.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   "Keep it going.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   "Because as you invest in the next generation,
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:39.200]   "God uses their faithfulness for global gospel proclamation."
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   And in this chapter in Acts 20,
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.200]   we see missions, pastoral ministry,
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.200]   and seminary training all converge
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   in a way that I hope is not only helpful for you
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.200]   as you think of investing yourself in others,
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   but also helpful as you ask God
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.200]   to be faithful to your own stewardship
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   for His glory and by His grace.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.200]   Let's pray.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   Father, we thank You for the truth of Your Word,
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.200]   for the example of the Apostle Paul,
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   and for all of it pointing to Your Son,
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.200]   How glorious it is to consider
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:31.200]   that You purchased the church at such a cost.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   May we steward it well by Your strength
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.200]   and for Your name's sake.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   And it's in that name that we pray these things this morning.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   Amen.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   [applause]
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   Very sobering, very important.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   Thank you, Nathan, for that.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   Men, I have an important announcement for you.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   As you know, this week is always the highlight
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.200]   for Pastor John, and he was hoping to be with us
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.200]   in person at this conference.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   However, he will not be able to join us in person.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.200]   He has asked H.B. to fill the pulpit tonight
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   and has sent a personal video greeting
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   that we will play at the end of the next session,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   along with a gift for each one of you
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.200]   that you will receive before you leave for lunch.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.200]   So you will not want to miss the next session.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   You're dismissed.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.200]   [silence]
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.260]   you
