[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (bells jingling)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.060]   - Merry Christmas Eve, podcast listeners.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.500]   Episode number 499 is a special episode
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.520]   with Pastor John, of course, but also with Noel.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.100]   Noel makes a rare cameo appearance with us today
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.340]   to talk about Christmas traditions in the Piper household.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.700]   And so we'll start with you, Pastor John.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.260]   You've had kids in the house for over 40 years,
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.340]   so what did Christmas look like in the Piper home
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.860]   when you had kids around?
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.120]   What were your goals?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.740]   - Christmas Day and how we celebrate it,
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.260]   how everybody celebrates it,
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.260]   ought to mark an event that is 10 million times
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.020]   more important than any event that has ever happened
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.600]   in the last 2,000 years since Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.660]   God, the creator of the universe,
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.380]   infinitely holy, just, wise, good,
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.620]   upholding the universe by the word of his power,
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.900]   absolutely independent of us and doesn't need us,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.900]   existing forever without us, took on human nature
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.940]   and entered this world precisely to die for sinners
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.900]   so that we could live forever in joy with him
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.540]   and not perish under God's wrath.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.860]   So it is an absolute understatement
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.740]   when the angel said at Jesus' birth,
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.740]   "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy."
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.820]   We wish there were words better, right?
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.460]   Great joy that will be for all the people.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.680]   So we've had two goals at the Piper house over the years
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.660]   with our five kids and our guests,
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.900]   pervasively Christ-centered, 'cause that's what it's about,
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.860]   and great joy because that's the effect
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020]   the angel said it ought to have,
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.100]   and it does have when you really grasp what it is.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.020]   And so that meant for us, way back, what, 45 years ago plus,
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.700]   rethinking everything that people usually do.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660]   And some things stayed in our tradition
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.600]   that we did growing up and other things went,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.540]   and some things were adapted,
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.880]   and some things were just totally created new.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.780]   Santa Claus went.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.380]   He is not a helpful participant in this.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.900]   He is a distraction from the majesty
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.980]   and joyfulness of Christ.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.180]   Giving gifts stayed.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.180]   That seemed to us like a beautiful,
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.140]   wonderful, happy expression of the heart of God
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.480]   in generosity to us.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.180]   And then we adapted and created things.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.100]   - So, Noelle's here with me,
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   and the Pipers set about transforming their house
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.020]   for the kids and for guests so that everywhere they look,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.200]   they see Christmas, Christmas, and its real meaning.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.220]   So, Noelle, what has guided you in particular,
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.100]   'cause you really came up with a lot of these,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.500]   what's guided your thinking as you've put things
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.260]   in place for the holidays?
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900]   - One of the things that I learned
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.380]   when our kids were really young
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.460]   is that very young kids aren't understanding symbols,
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.180]   so it's the things that are tangible.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.220]   And so right away, when I'm thinking about Christmas,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.260]   what am I thinking about?
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380]   Bethlehem and the stable,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.220]   and looking and thinking and talking
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.420]   about what God was doing there.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.960]   So manger scenes, creches, are a main part
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.380]   of what's in our house or in our windows
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.940]   for people outside to see during the Christmas season.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.780]   There's one main manger scene
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.020]   that we've had almost our whole marriage
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.140]   that's on a special table in the living room.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.360]   That's the first thing you see when you walk into our house,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.280]   when you walk into the living room.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.220]   Under that table is where we gather our gifts to each other.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.740]   And then there are manger scenes
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.540]   and things that represent Bethlehem all over the place
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.820]   whenever anybody's traveling somewhere,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.160]   and they ask me if they could bring me a gift,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.100]   I always say, "I'd love to have a manger scene from there."
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.060]   (laughs)
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.900]   - So we got elephants at our manger scene.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.740]   (laughs)
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.580]   - Because the wise men came from the East
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.460]   and we don't know they came on camels.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.540]   - Right, of course.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.260]   - So over in the dining room, Noel, on the buffet,
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.160]   there's another thing that's a little unusual.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.000]   What do you call it?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.820]   What is it?
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.740]   Why do we do it?
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.700]   - We call it the Jesus tree.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's a combination of what some people might have
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440]   and call a Jesse tree,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.380]   or some people might call a Bethlehem tree.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.820]   But I call it a Jesus tree
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.380]   because that's the one time in the year
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.820]   when we can put in front of us
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.260]   all the kinds of symbols, word pictures,
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.780]   representing word pictures from the Bible of who Jesus is.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.220]   So on this tree will be--
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.380]   - When you say tree, you mean--
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.240]   - I mean a bare branch, yes,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.340]   that we cut off of a,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.300]   broke off of a bush in the backyard.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.260]   And so some of the things that are hanging on it
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.380]   might actually be Christmas ornaments,
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.320]   but other things would be maybe a saw
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.740]   that would represent a part of Jesus' life.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.020]   He was a carpenter with his father.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.060]   Or there might be a sheaf of wheat,
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.620]   and that might represent Ruth in his family tree,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.780]   or it might represent him being the bread of life.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.820]   There would be nails because it is carpenter,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.980]   part of his life,
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.620]   or because he died on the cross for us.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.580]   So things that represent the prophecies
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.900]   leading up to Jesus,
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.500]   things that represent events in his life,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.780]   things that particularly revolve around the Bethlehem event.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.420]   - Yeah, so this is a gnarly, you know, broken off branch
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.380]   from what's that plant on the corner of the garage
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.220]   that we get it from usually?
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.220]   - It's an old lilac bush that we use.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.260]   - Yeah, lilac bush.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.120]   There's this other tradition that gets going
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.460]   about the beginning of Advent
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.460]   that we call the shepherd's pouch.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.460]   What's that about?
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.880]   - I was trying to think of ways
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.360]   that children could give a gift to Jesus
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.540]   since it is his birthday,
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.660]   and that's how children understand birthdays.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.740]   You give a gift to the birthday person.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.060]   So we have little burlap bags that I made,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.340]   but you could use any kind of little pouch
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.980]   that at the beginning of December,
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.980]   the kids start putting money into
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.300]   that either they've earned by doing tasks ordinarily
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.140]   that they might do just without pay,
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.080]   but during this season, I give them some money.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.080]   So it also gets me eager helpers when I need extra help.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.600]   But then sometime early in the month,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.020]   we're thinking about where this gift will go,
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.980]   like maybe to Johnny and Friends or to Samaritan's Purse,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.220]   some organization that we'd like to give to,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.800]   and we talk about what it means to give a gift to Jesus
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.700]   'cause you can't just put it in his hand.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.780]   And then on Christmas Eve,
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.060]   the children put the money from their pouch
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.620]   by the manger at our special manger scene,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.820]   and we talk about we're giving a gift to Jesus.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.340]   Ours is money, but that's just a symbol
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.780]   of the way the shepherds, for instance,
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.020]   came worshiping Jesus, their gift of worship to Jesus.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.100]   And then on Christmas morning,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.760]   we have put into those little pouches gifts for them.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.400]   One of the things will be a Christ-centered
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.260]   Christmas ornament for them to save up
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.060]   for when they have their own home someday.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.100]   And then there are other just little doodad things
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.860]   that we've collected over time for them.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.540]   And we talk about these represent the way God blesses people
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.780]   who come to him with their gifts of praise.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.620]   - Amen.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.440]   We love that.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.820]   I just love this little pouch thing.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.140]   I love so much the kids filling it with money
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.580]   and then getting these gifts.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.780]   One more thing.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.300]   Christmas morning, we get up,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   and before any gifts are open, we're reading a story,
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.900]   but then we add to the reading something else, Noel,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.340]   that turns out to be a really happy thing,
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.740]   especially for little kids.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.380]   - And I know there are other families that do this too.
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.860]   We act out the Christmas story.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.460]   Everybody who's there, adults and children,
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.780]   when the children were very little,
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.500]   they liked to pull out everything they could find
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.100]   that could be costumes from anywhere.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   Now it's a lot more simple,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.780]   but we use the narrative from Luke
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.180]   as the guide for how the story plays out.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.620]   And that's another part of being tangible
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.700]   and actually getting into it physically,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.620]   thinking about Jesus being born in the manger
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.940]   and the glory that was announced when that happened.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.580]   - I think we even did this.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.700]   When our first child was Jesus,
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.340]   that is the little baby in Mary's lap,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.900]   and she's Noel and I and the baby
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.260]   and any guests that were around.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.140]   And so every time we had a new child,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.820]   we had a new Jesus to put in the play.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.980]   It was just great.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   But it's Christmas Eve or it's Christmas Day,
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.300]   and people have lots of things to do.
