[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.760]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 172.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.080]   Here in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.900]   joined as always by my producer, Jesse,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740]   and we've got ourselves a good old fashioned
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.260]   listener calls episode, which I am looking forward to.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.480]   Now, this is the first recording session
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.760]   that we have done in the month of February.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.280]   We're doing this, I don't know what today is,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.020]   February 4th, maybe, February 5th, something like that.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.920]   So you know what that means,
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760]   if it's the first session in a new month,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.840]   we should take some time to talk about
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.400]   the books I read in the preceding month.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.600]   We're trying to make that a habit here on the show.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   So I thought we would start things off today
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   talking about the five books I read in January 2022.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.640]   Quick background on that,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840]   I usually aim to read around five books a month,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440]   and the two things I do to accomplish this goal is,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.020]   one, I make reading more of a default activity.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.320]   So instead of looking at a phone or a tablet
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.640]   for random online distraction,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.220]   I make looking at a book my default activity.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.380]   And two, I read a wide variety of books
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.820]   of different styles, different genres,
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.160]   different levels of difficulty
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.440]   so that it doesn't become tedious
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.500]   or doesn't become too much of a chore.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.140]   I don't care what format, audio, Kindle,
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.380]   hardcover, whatever, just keep reading.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.960]   I also believe in not overthinking what you read.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.500]   Just reading a lot of interesting stuff
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.860]   is better than having some sort of carefully curated list
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.300]   with which you're trying to impress people.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.360]   All right, so let's get into it.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.540]   The books I read in January 2022.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.500]   So those who have followed this segment
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.180]   in previous months know I've been on a kick recently
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.020]   of reading books that have to do
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.180]   with the entertainment industry.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.780]   I'm not sure why, I just like that genre.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.100]   I did some cinema books,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.440]   I've done some biographies of directors.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.060]   My entry in this sequence of books for January
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.060]   was Will Smith's new biography, which is titled "Will",
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.820]   which I actually quite enjoyed.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.820]   Now, "Will" is co-authored,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.180]   Will Smith co-authored it with Mark Manson,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.740]   who you might know as the author
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.740]   of the subtle art of not giving an F word, that book,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000]   which sold, and I'm using the official terms here, Jesse,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.580]   all the copies.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.780]   That's what I have here.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.420]   I have here on my official notes.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.060]   It sold, that book sold an absurd number of copies.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.500]   I'm talking like 18 million copies.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.020]   It's a crazily successful book.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.060]   So he co-authored, so Will Smith, I think,
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.320]   liked the subtle art and asked Mark
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.580]   to co-author "Will" with him.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.440]   The way I learned about this is Mark told me,
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.700]   it's a pretty small world,
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060]   Jesse, you could probably imagine this to be the case.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.340]   There's only so many of us that are sort of in our 30s
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.340]   or now late 30s now who write pragmatic nonfiction books
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.580]   for major publishers.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.020]   There's a group of us,
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.660]   and we all kind of know each other, right?
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.900]   Because we're all like the same age.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.220]   We all sort of write the same thing.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.500]   So Mark is in that group.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.020]   Ryan Holiday is in that group.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.460]   Tim Ferris is in that group.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.780]   James Clear is in that group.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.480]   I'm in that group.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.320]   So we all know each other.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.380]   So a few years ago, Mark was giving a talk.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.380]   He was doing a lecture tour.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.860]   He was giving a talk here in the DC area,
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.780]   actually kind of near to where I live, near here.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.100]   He was in Silver Spring was the talk at the Fillmore,
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.140]   which is near Tacoma Park.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   So I was like, well, just come hang out,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.540]   like before your talk.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.980]   So he came and we wandered the streets of Tacoma Park
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.700]   and just talked as one does.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.740]   And I remember him telling me,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.500]   he's like, here's what I'm working on now,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.100]   a biography with Will Smith.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.180]   I was like, well, that's crazy.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.020]   That's interesting.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.660]   Not at all what I thought you were going to say.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.420]   And it sounded awesome.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.740]   He was like, yeah, Will's method was he would be like,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.020]   hey, Mark, I'm going somewhere cool.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.420]   Do you want to just come with me?
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.260]   And he would just bring them and they could just chat
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.100]   when they had downtime.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.780]   I thought that was the coolest thing.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.980]   I was like, all right, go for it.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.740]   And the book is good.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.560]   It's good.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.100]   I sent Mark a note about this.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.660]   It's really hard to write these memoirs
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.020]   'cause you have to capture like a unique voice
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.740]   and you need to be psychologically self-reflective
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.620]   and yet also capture how did the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.460]   become a show.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.420]   And I thought it did it really well.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.620]   I'm actually surprised this book
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.740]   has not gotten more critical love.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.740]   So I sent Mark a note and said,
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.700]   I think you did a great job.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.700]   This is a hard book to write.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.620]   I couldn't have done this.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.020]   And so I really enjoyed it.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.060]   That'd be my analysis.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.380]   Have I told you my Will Smith story?
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.460]   - No, I want to hear it.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.220]   - All right, so I was in my first year,
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.860]   maybe my second year of graduate school at MIT.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.940]   And I had just published "How to Win at College"
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.200]   and "How to Be a Straight A Student."
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.940]   And I got contacted by Will's people.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.160]   And maybe it was Jaden at the time.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.060]   One of his kids was, you know,
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.800]   of the age where you care about grades,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.700]   like junior high or something.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.240]   And they're like, can you come like down to Miami
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.820]   and like just talk with Will about how to study
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.360]   and how to do whatever.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.940]   And do you play golf?
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.460]   I remember like, you want to just come down to the golf course
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.180]   and for various reasons, it didn't work out.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.020]   But I remember--
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.840]   - Do you play golf?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.680]   - I don't play golf.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.520]   And I told him, I was like,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.980]   I cannot go to a golf course with Will Smith.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.620]   When I literally, I would be holding,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.060]   this would be the scene, right?
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.420]   So Will Smith would walk in superhero shape, you know,
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.500]   like everyone's just happy to see him there.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   He's incredibly competitive.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.320]   So he's probably been at that point
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.540]   getting one-on-one golf training.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.940]   - He's going to gamble with you, get you nerves.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.180]   - Gambling, yeah, let's gamble with me.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.220]   I'm going to walk out there.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.020]   He's like, I'm glad you're here, Cal.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.000]   And then he's going to say, I don't mean to interrupt,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.760]   but you're holding the golf club upside down.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.120]   That's not a handle.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.820]   That's the face of the golf club
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.860]   you're supposed to hit it with.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.700]   Point two, I think our business here is done.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.740]   And that's how that would have played out.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.780]   That would not have been good.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.400]   That would not have been good.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.260]   But I like his, I like that attitude though of like,
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.060]   okay, you have a problem.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.100]   Like, I want to help my kid with studying.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.500]   Nice situation to be in.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.780]   To be like, all right, so who's the guy
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.400]   who's like top at study strategies right now?
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.260]   Let's get him down here.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.060]   And I don't know if Will Smith had anything to do with,
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.260]   like, that could have been his people.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.620]   He might've just told someone like,
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.100]   can you find someone to come talk to me?
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.940]   And they will come down.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.760]   - So did you go down there?
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.600]   - I didn't go down there.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.180]   - Because of golf or because you were busy
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.260]   with other stuff?
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.700]   I mean, also like, I'm not a one-on-one tutor, you know?
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.380]   - Like, you know, I get it.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.200]   I don't fault people for trying to get the best,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.940]   best for their kids, but like, it just felt weird to me.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.940]   I was like, I don't know, man.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.620]   I'm like a doctoral student here at MIT
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.900]   trying to do whatever.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.140]   I don't, and I'm not good at one-on-one tutoring.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.020]   That's not my thing.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.980]   You know me, if I'm not in front of a microphone,
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.220]   I'm weird and antisocial.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.180]   - That's not true.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.100]   - Yeah, anyways, that did not make it to the book.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.260]   So I flipped to that.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.140]   I didn't see that in the book.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.980]   And so I threw it out.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.800]   No, but it was a good book.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.060]   I really enjoyed Will.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.700]   You know, that gets a driven guy.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.420]   It's just a driven guy.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.500]   - All those people make it to that level are so driven.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   It's insane.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.700]   - The thing about that personifies Will Smith
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.500]   that I learned in that book is
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   he hired a Monopoly coach at some point
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.900]   just because they played Monopoly a fair amount.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.620]   And he's like, I want to be the best at Monopoly
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.300]   and hired a professional Monopoly player, which exists.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.980]   The tournament player to drill him
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.940]   until he could like for sure dominate his family
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.040]   when playing Monopoly.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.820]   I think that tells you everything you need to know, right?
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.660]   About why he was the biggest superstar in the world.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.940]   It's just, there was a driven mentality
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.100]   of like, let's get after it.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.760]   Like, I don't want to lose, you know, which I,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.740]   all of these guys and women that are
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.940]   at the top of their field, the same way.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.340]   Like if I'm going to play Monopoly, I'm going to win.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.740]   - Yeah, they're extremely competitive business athletes.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.580]   - Yeah.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.400]   All right.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.240]   So I liked that book.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.060]   Then I read, oh, I should say good audio book too.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.020]   They do clips and audio, like his songs.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.100]   We was talking about his songs.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.860]   Like they play the audio of the songs.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.780]   It's actually, it's well, well produced audio book.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.620]   All right.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.180]   So I actually did two books in January
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.060]   that had to do with the entertainment industry.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.020]   The other one was "The Late Shift,"
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.860]   which was a book that came out, I guess in the 2000s
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.180]   or the nineties about the battle between Jay Leno
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.900]   and David Letterman to see who was going to get
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.260]   the "Tonight Show" after Johnny Carson retired.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.900]   And the reason why, it was actually the show,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.700]   our show that motivated me.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.820]   It's like, I actually would be interested to find out more
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.060]   about this world of late night TV and how these,
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.540]   how these top performers crafted these shows
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.820]   and tried to build audiences.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.220]   And that was actually my inspiration.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.500]   Interesting book there.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.380]   What I learned is Dave Letterman
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.420]   was a huge broadcasting talent, right?
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.940]   So his show was incredibly original
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.100]   and he was pushing the medium.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.540]   He was very much understood the medium of visual television
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.100]   and would do things with the camera
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.260]   and take it different places
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.700]   and had a very distinctive voice.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.500]   So he was a huge talent.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   Jay Leno didn't have that talent so much,
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.780]   but what Jay would do was the monologue.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.260]   And that was his whole thing.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   We're going to, the jokes in the monologue
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260]   are going to be top-notch and topical.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.100]   And it's going to be longer than Letterman's monologue
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.340]   by far, it's going to be longer than Carson's monologue was.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.220]   And he was all about the monologue.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.100]   And that in the end sort of won the late night war.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.380]   The people just, let me just turn over
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.740]   and see like really funny jokes
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.620]   about what's going on in the news.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.460]   I was a huge Letterman fan,
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.540]   huge Letterman fan in the nineties.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.940]   Me and my friends got tickets.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.340]   We went out to the Ed Sullivan Theater.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.860]   I've seen him perform back when he was doing the show,
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.780]   but it was like smart, weird,
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.220]   wry, eccentric humor, beautifully done.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.980]   In the end, what won that late night war was just,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.700]   I want like a really good Clinton joke.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.260]   And so it was fascinating, fascinating book.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.620]   And the other thing I learned from that is like,
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.500]   it's incredibly hard to run a late night show,
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.940]   just to not come across as weird on camera.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.020]   Like to be someone who can be on screen like that
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.900]   for 90 minutes and the audience stays with you,
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.500]   it's just really hard to do.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.180]   And so if you were one of the few people who could do it,
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.820]   they would just dump truck money at your house.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.100]   Like the money involved in this was crazy.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.700]   Leno was getting 7 million and that jumped up.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.900]   Letterman was in the teens per year,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.580]   15 plus million dollars per year in the nineties
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.380]   because no one could do this.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.580]   People tried and it was a debacle.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.600]   But like, if you could, you got all the money basically.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.420]   - Are they around equally wealthy?
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.300]   - Yeah, they're just super rich.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.140]   - Yeah.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.740]   - Yeah, they both just got really wealthy.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.560]   All right, moving away from books
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.580]   about the entertainment industry.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.840]   I read this book, which we've talked about on the show now
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.100]   multiple times in the last few weeks,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.680]   How to Take Smart Notes.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.020]   And so this was the book about Zettelkasten note-taking.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.800]   And I mean, I don't know if this is true,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.940]   but I think it was one of the books that helped bring
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.140]   the details of this method to an English-speaking audience.
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.620]   So the author is drawing from research
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.040]   that was done in Germany, where they were studying
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.940]   the productivity of the sociologist, Luhmann,
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.800]   who used this Zettelkasten method to great effect
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.900]   and had this incredibly productive academic career.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.500]   And then this team from the University of Berlin
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.460]   was trying to study how is he so productive.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.100]   And they're like, oh, it's this note-taking system.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.700]   So this was kind of a German thing.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.860]   And How to Take Smart Notes brought the concept over
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.140]   to English-speaking audiences.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.420]   This book took a long route to get to me.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.980]   Actually, one of my readers sent it to me
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.660]   at some point early in the pandemic.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.620]   Now, Georgetown was pretty, they shut down for a long time.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.820]   Long story short, Georgetown shut down for a long time.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.300]   So I don't know how long this book,
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.220]   someone at some point, someone put it in my office
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.700]   with a big stack of mail, but I was gone for a year.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.460]   They shut down, more than a year.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.340]   I mean, they shut down in March of 2020.
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.220]   And I was back in my office in the fall of '21,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.260]   like five months ago, right?
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.740]   And so there's a whole stack of mail, and this was in there.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.780]   So it might've been in my office for a year.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.340]   And the whole thing got water damaged.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.780]   There had been a flood and so,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.540]   but I rescued from the stack this book
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.700]   that a reader had sent me.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.340]   And it's really cool.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.180]   It's always interesting.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.700]   So if you're interested in the Zettelkasten stuff
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.940]   we're talking about, that's the book.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.500]   That's the book, it's short.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.740]   It gets into it.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.460]   It's incredibly optimistic.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.620]   It has this Lumen philosophy of,
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.580]   if you have your system right, writing becomes effortless.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.380]   Listeners know I don't quite buy that,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.620]   but it is the right introduction, I believe,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.140]   into that type of note-taking.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.500]   All right, moving on now.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.820]   Then I read "The Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything."
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:33.220]   So this was a nonfiction book that basically surveyed
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.740]   for a popular audience, Jesuit theology,
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.140]   and tried to extract lessons from the different parts
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.980]   of Jesuit theology that would be applicable
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.060]   to a large crowd, including large secular crowd.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.980]   I'm at a Jesuit university, I figured I should know more
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.540]   about Ignatian spirituality,
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.100]   so I read "The Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything."
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.420]   So it's really advice-y.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.940]   So it'll be, okay, here is something that we Jesuits do,
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.300]   but here's why this is important,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.860]   and here's why, whether you're a Catholic or not,
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.260]   or religious or not, you should think about
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.460]   doing these type of things in your life.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.300]   That's the general format of this book.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.700]   And it was pretty good.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.820]   It was long, but it was good.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   It was good to get a nice survey and history
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.940]   of the Jesuit order.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.340]   You also got a pretty good insight biographically
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.900]   into what it's like to join a monastic order,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.180]   like what that process is like,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.020]   what life is like as a Jesuit,
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.180]   like what that's actually like.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.940]   And the author, Father Donovan, gets into it.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.420]   Here's what it's like, here's the hard parts,
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.580]   here's why I did it, here's how old I was.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.420]   Kind of interesting.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.540]   - You and Ferris kind of had a religious conversation
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.900]   when you were on his podcast yesterday or two days ago.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.820]   - Yeah, yeah, we got into it, yeah.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.020]   Yeah, we were joking about it before
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.100]   because we had a similar conversation with Lex Fridman
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.100]   that for some reason, for the tech podcast crowd,
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.820]   I've become the sounding board for thinking
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.260]   through the role of religion in your life.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.340]   It's an interesting role.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.220]   Maybe because I'm one of the few commentators
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.500]   in that space that will just talk religion straight up
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.460]   and just treat it as something to think about
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.300]   and look through its advantages.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.260]   I mean, there was such a powerful, not to digress,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.100]   but there was such a powerful impact on that space
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.220]   caused by the new atheist in the 2000s
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.900]   that has, like it really boxed in religion,
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.940]   especially if you're a Silicon Valley type,
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.940]   to like an untouchable thing.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.860]   And that box is only now, I think, starting to dissolve.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.580]   Like people are taking tentative steps,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.340]   people who are hardcore tech or whatever.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.980]   Let me just think a little bit more about religion.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.940]   But for a while, it was the new atheist,
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.180]   Dawkins and Dennett and Harris had just packaged that up
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.700]   and it was sort of intellectually unavailable.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.580]   So it's interesting to see it come back.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.820]   Honestly, I think it was probably Jordan Peterson
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.860]   that his rise and fall and rise again or whatever,
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.100]   I think had a big impact on shaking loose
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.420]   the new atheist grip on religion
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.180]   in certain types of circles.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.900]   That's my best guess.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.180]   And I think what we forget about the new atheist
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.940]   is that they were a reaction in large part to the Bush era.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.180]   So for the younger people listening,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.140]   they might not have this background,
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.700]   but like new atheism in 2003,
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.220]   when you're writing this type of stuff,
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.060]   like new atheism,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.860]   you had two really strong motivating factors.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.260]   You had the 9/11 attack.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.700]   So this was this big, strong, motivating factor,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.300]   especially for people like Harris about,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.700]   religious fundamentalism just leads to terrible things.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.140]   Why are we tolerate it?
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.140]   And you had the sort of elite liberal reaction to George W
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.660]   and the evangelicals that helped him get elected.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.540]   And so it was like very counter,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.780]   it was counter-cultural back then.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.500]   Like you were pushing back against this,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.460]   especially when he got reelected in 2004,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.340]   a lot of people felt like,
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.300]   "Man, there's this religious majority
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.260]   and I'm rejecting that."
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.700]   Like religion's no good or whatever.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.380]   So there was a counter-cultural feel to it.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.700]   And then the cultural whole flipped, everything flipped.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.500]   And now to be religious is,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.660]   now you're in the cultural minority
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.620]   and have very little cultural leverage.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.900]   And I think it's in that environment
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.140]   that that box around religion
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.220]   starting to open up a little bit.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.180]   So I don't know why I'm the person
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.660]   people are asking about this.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.100]   Talk to Father Donovan.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.260]   That's the guy you should talk about.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.420]   I don't know why people ask me,
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.620]   but I just think it's interesting
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.900]   that it's a conversation now,
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.540]   that Ferris is interested.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.860]   Basically, I felt like he was saying,
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.740]   "I can't be religious, but maybe I should be religious."
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.500]   - I think he was just looking for your advice
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.060]   on certain things on how to, as you would term it,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.660]   live a deep life and be fulfilled, to be quite honest.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.900]   'Cause I mean, I've listened to every single one
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.780]   of his podcasts and I think he's got a lot organized,
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.340]   but I think he's trying to figure some stuff out too.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.380]   And you have a lot organized
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.140]   and you can bounce the ideas off him.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.460]   I think you just wanted to, you're well-read, obviously.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.380]   - Yeah, yeah, so anyways, that was interesting.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.220]   That was interesting.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.900]   So that's a trend to keep an eye on,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.340]   is the, maybe this is all just cyclical.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.980]   Things like religion come and go, come and go,
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.220]   and in cycles you have flips in the cultural mainstream.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.140]   All right, final book from January, 2022.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.540]   It was called "Giants."
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.740]   I don't have the subtitle here,
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.420]   but so "Giants" is a dual biography
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.500]   of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.820]   And so it contrasts their life,
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.100]   and of course in the end they then become intertwined.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.540]   Their lives actually collided
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.980]   during the Civil War presidency of Lincoln.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.500]   This is a book, so this was written
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.860]   by John Stoffer at Harvard.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.340]   And I don't know why I haven't read it yet.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.940]   So I'm a big Lincolnophile, I read a lot of Lincoln.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.580]   This is a signed copy of the book
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.940]   that I've had since it came out in earlier in the 2000s,
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.500]   because when we were in Cambridge,
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:12.620]   when I was at MIT, my wife worked with John Stoffer's wife
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.300]   at a history education-focused nonprofit.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.620]   So John was always doing events
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.020]   and was kind of intertwined in that world.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.860]   We babysat for his kids and stuff like that.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.220]   And so when this book came out,
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.260]   we went through the book release.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.820]   I have a signed copy from him.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.500]   Big Lincoln fan, never read the book until now.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.340]   I don't know why.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.620]   It's fantastic, it's really good.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.220]   I mean, it's very hard for scholars sometimes
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.780]   to be able to write in a way that is accessible.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.820]   I thought it was very accessible, but very smart.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.340]   And just, I know it won some awards and rightly so.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.900]   So I'm glad, basically, I guess I'm glad
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.780]   that I finally got around to reading Giants.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.220]   I think it's a really good profile of that age,
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.500]   that period leading up to the Civil War,
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.220]   and that contrast between Douglas coming out of slavery
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.940]   and trying to define himself
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.700]   and make his way in what he faced,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.420]   and then Lincoln coming out of the rural frontier poverty
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.260]   and how their views evolved over time.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.820]   It was really well handled in a very readable way.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.120]   So, thumbs up to Giants.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.180]   Thumbs up to Giants as well.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.260]   There you go, Jesse, those are my five books.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.100]   Let's see, it's November 4th or 5th?
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.380]   - 4th. - 4th, okay.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.420]   I'm almost done with my second book of February.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.260]   - I was just gonna ask you that.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.100]   - Yeah, progress is coming.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.380]   - I was like, how many have you done in February?
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.660]   - I'm almost done with my second.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.820]   Well, I have a beast of a book I'm working on.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.520]   I started it back in January, 600 pages,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.540]   and I'll talk about it when we get there.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.180]   But I'm just working on that a bit at a time.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.820]   So I'm front-loading a little bit.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.500]   I don't know if I'm gonna finish it in February or not,
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.340]   though, it's a beast.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.340]   It's 600 pages, but 600 pages of dense writing,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.380]   and I'm taking my time with it
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.820]   because I really like this book.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.620]   So I'm kind of front-loading some other reading
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.660]   to see if I can't get this done in February,
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.700]   I'll get it done in March.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.740]   And I'm going to Florida in a little bit,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.300]   so that'll give me some good reading time too.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.860]   So I feel good about February, I'm on track.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.300]   - Less days.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.700]   - That's true though, less days, yeah.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.180]   Yeah, you gotta get after it.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.900]   All right, well, speaking of getting after it,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.300]   let's do some listener calls.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.880]   So who do we have here first?
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.380]   - All right, so our first call is from Jeff.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.540]   Basically has a deep life question.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.300]   He wants an example from you, so we'll take a listen,
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.460]   see what he has to say.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   - Hi Cal, my name is Jeff and I am an IT consultant.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.180]   I've been a big fan of yours ever since,
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.340]   So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.100]   And I've read similar books, such as Ultra Learning,
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.780]   Peak Performance, Grit, and Atomic Habits.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.180]   These books are full of practical advice
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.000]   on how to improve learning and skills
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.580]   and contribute to the deep life.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.500]   However, I find myself never implementing them.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.240]   What kind of strategy would you suggest using
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.920]   to incorporate concepts found in books of this genre?
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.820]   How long should one try something new
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.820]   before deciding it doesn't work for them?
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.020]   And I think it would be great if you can give an example
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.660]   of a habit or advice you once read about
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.460]   and then incorporated into your daily life.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.300]   Thank you.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:23.540]   - So Jeff, the systematic advice I give
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.500]   for laying the foundation for a deep life,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.780]   integrating new ideas into the deep life
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.780]   is based on the deep life buckets.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.000]   I think that's exactly what you need
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.140]   for what you're talking about here.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.140]   You define the different areas that are important to you
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.520]   living a life well lived.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.740]   We call these the deep life buckets.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.100]   The standard examples we give, for example, is craft,
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.860]   which is the things you produce, your work,
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.220]   the things you build.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.180]   Constitution, which is your health and fitness,
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.780]   community, your connection to people that are around you
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.860]   and that matter to you, and contemplation,
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.560]   theology, ethics, and philosophy,
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.580]   just as a starting point.
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.840]   But you have your areas that are important to you.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.500]   Then you wanna have a keystone habit in each of these areas,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.600]   something you do every day.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.820]   So this is where when you learn new things
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.800]   could be integrated into what this keystone habit is.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.100]   And that's a warmup.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   So now you say, okay, I'm in the habit of doing
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.140]   optional activity in each of the areas of my life
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.640]   that are important on a regular basis,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.040]   even though I don't have to.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.980]   So you're signaling to yourself,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.020]   I take these parts of my life seriously.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.820]   Then you dedicate four to six weeks
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.540]   to each of these buckets, one by one,
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.580]   to say, now I'm gonna do a more systematic overhaul
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580]   of that part of my life,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.580]   where I might remove multiple things out of my life
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.000]   related to that bucket that are just in the way,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.660]   that are cluttered, that are taking up time,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.680]   streamline, and then I might add into it
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.700]   or refine the things I do in that part of my life
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.340]   so I get a maximum value return.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.120]   So it's all about focusing on things that are high return
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.140]   and avoiding the things that don't give you much return
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.120]   or get in the way.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.660]   That is exactly where you can be integrating new advice.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.000]   So just do this once a year.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.560]   I suggest doing it in the lead up to your birthday.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.380]   That's the way I like to think about this.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.820]   You're doing an overhaul in the months
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.660]   leading up to your birthday,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.780]   and that's where you can look at what's working,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.180]   what's not working in each of the areas of your life,
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.140]   integrate new ideas, integrate new systems,
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.060]   integrate new habits.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.900]   That's what I would recommend.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.860]   All right, in terms of examples from my own life,
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.620]   things that I've integrated or not integrated,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.220]   let me think about that.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.140]   I'm thinking in my mind,
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.220]   if you wanna know what's going on here,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.220]   I'm thinking through my mind in different categories.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.640]   You know, like I've had a pretty major,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.460]   pretty major constitution,
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.880]   so health and fitness overhaul,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.580]   I do those, you know, every once in a while,
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.660]   and I've done, I put a lot of time into that.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.900]   So I gave it its four to six week focus
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.440]   to overhaul somewhat recently.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.880]   And so there's a few things I do.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.740]   So the keystone habit,
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.960]   the keystone habit I do now is there's a tracking habit
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.300]   where I track the, as I've done before,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.740]   the exercise I do, like what did I do today?
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.040]   And the steps I take, I had been doing that.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.220]   I added to it weight every morning.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.100]   You gotta look at it, look at the number,
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.220]   and that's, you know, you gotta face it.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.740]   Best motivator is a very powerful keystone habit.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.060]   You have to face it, and you know you have to face it.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.900]   And it can really keep you away from, you know,
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.300]   I should not be eating this or drinking this as much.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.220]   And so that was a keystone habit.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.060]   Then I've had a pretty radical overhaul
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.900]   in terms of my actual fitness.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.660]   I'm going through a rowing program.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.140]   I have a Concept2 rower,
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.240]   and the stave off the winter,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.380]   can't be outside as much,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.020]   blues and not get as much sunshine, blues.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.700]   I have a daily, it's a daily rowing program
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.340]   where it's every day, here's the workout you're doing,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.220]   here's the workout you're doing.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.820]   So that gives me flashbacks from my old college crew days.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.860]   I've replaced, I always have a baseline
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.220]   of doing a thousand pull-ups a month,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.740]   but I've now added into it,
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.660]   I think I have that right, a thousand, yeah, 36.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.940]   Am I doing that math right, Jesse?
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.480]   36 a day.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.320]   - That's solid.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.940]   - Yeah, and I've always done that.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.940]   But now I'm actually doing workout routines beyond that.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.860]   But let me tell you, just to walk you through this,
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.740]   to me, that's all just breaking the seal.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.940]   So this was what I was gonna be doing in January.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.300]   I'm doing it now January through February
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.580]   because I hurt my back in January,
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.940]   so I got a slow start.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.980]   I'm just breaking the seal.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.980]   I'm getting used to like, I'm doing a rowing workout.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.680]   I'm getting used to doing like real workouts
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.520]   beyond just my pull-ups or whatever.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.460]   All of that is just to get me used to that
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.980]   being a non-trivial part of my life
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.020]   so that then I can upgrade that
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.180]   when we get later in February.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.980]   And so now I wanna do some serious training.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.780]   But I didn't wanna jump straight into serious training.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.620]   I figured I had to overhaul my life
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.540]   to that that's a big part of my day
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.460]   and I'm used to it and I'm in that groove
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.700]   and I'm doing hard work every day,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.200]   somewhat randomly, but I'm doing it, right?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.120]   And then when I'm done doing that for a month or two,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.060]   then I'm gonna say, now I can up my game.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.940]   And actually, Jeff, my idea is I wanna train for something.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.560]   I don't know what yet,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.060]   but that is an example of deep life thinking.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.380]   That's me focusing on the constitution bucket.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.560]   So I'm turning 40 this summer
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.140]   and I figure I really gotta start caring
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.300]   about my health and fitness more
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.140]   because that's the age for men where a lot of things,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.020]   a lot of things go downhill.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.540]   And so there's a high leverage moment
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.380]   to be in really good shape.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.800]   And so that's, I made that whole overhaul plan
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.140]   and that's just for the constitution bucket.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.580]   And now that plan's kind of operating.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.740]   So now I can, there's other buckets I could think about.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.220]   That's an example of what those overhauls look like.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.100]   I should get your advice.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.300]   So when the time comes, Jesse, I'll get your advice.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.420]   Jesse knows about gyms and exercise.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.060]   So he'll get me.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.020]   That's what we should do with the HQ.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.660]   Should we just have it be essentially like a gym?
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.980]   - We can put a pull-up bar in.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.820]   - We should put a pull-up bar in.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.220]   - You can just put one right in the door.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.440]   - Can I tell you something about pull-up bars?
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.180]   Those ones you just put in the doors
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.900]   that are supposed to somehow like counter,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.880]   just counter lever in and you can use them.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.640]   I've never in my life got that to work.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.720]   - Really? I have one at my house.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.560]   I've had it forever.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.580]   - Where it just like, there's no screws or anything.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.420]   It's just, I must be doing it wrong.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.260]   - Yeah, it works great.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.140]   I've had it for years.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.060]   - I must be doing it wrong.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.420]   'Cause I've had multiple of these
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.860]   'cause I've been doing pull-ups ever since I was,
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.340]   left 22 and left college.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.900]   It was a rowing thing, right?
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.860]   I've never got it to work.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.060]   I'm like, there's no way this is gonna work.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.860]   I put it up there and it just drops to the ground.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.180]   Like, how am I supposed to do pull-ups on this thing?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.160]   I'm doing something wrong.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.600]   All right, we got to figure that out.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.520]   We will start doing pull-ups here.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   Anyways, thanks for that question, Jeff.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.640]   All right, now, before we move on to our next call,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.360]   we wanna take a moment to actually talk about the sponsors
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.700]   that makes this show possible.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.340]   Pull-up bars aren't just given out for free on the street.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.540]   They actually cost money.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.640]   So we do need to have some sponsors for this show.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.920]   And our first sponsor is Policy Genius.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.520]   Now, Policy Genius is a one-stop shop
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.280]   to find and buy the insurance you need.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.520]   We're talking here home and auto coverage.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.140]   Policy Genius can help you save money
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.080]   on how much you are paying.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.300]   It's really easy to do.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.900]   You go to policygenius.com and answer a few questions.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.180]   Policy Genius then shows you price estimates
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.380]   for different policies that fits what you need.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.960]   You can just look at it right there and say,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.640]   is any of these cheaper than what I'm paying?
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.720]   Now, they're pretty good at finding you good deals
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.600]   at Policy Genius.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.880]   They will look, for example, at bundles.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.560]   Maybe you have home insurance bundled
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.460]   with your auto insurance and the whole thing gets cheaper.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.200]   But if you do this, you are probably going to save money.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.800]   Jesse, quiz for you.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.080]   What do you think the average amount per year
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.720]   Policy Genius saves their users
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.160]   over what they were paying before
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.600]   in home and auto insurance?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.880]   - I think the average monthly for insurance
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.120]   for like a new car is probably, what, 600?
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.840]   And then they probably save, six to $800 they save?
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.980]   - 1,250.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.240]   So they do a good job.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.080]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.240]   Jesse's numbers are biased because his truck,
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.440]   which I believe is 75 years old
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.880]   and is 65% rust, his pickup truck,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.580]   I believe the insurance cost on that
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.560]   is like $17 a year or something.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.400]   - $200 a year.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.220]   - $200 a year.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.440]   So he's a little bit biased.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.120]   He's not exactly driving a brand new,
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.940]   I don't even know cars.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.880]   I don't know what a fancy car is,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.640]   a brand new Bentley or something.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.320]   But if you don't have a truck that's 75 years old,
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.780]   you could be saving a lot of money

[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   They've helped over 30 million people.

[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.440]   Now, Jesse, our other sponsor here,
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.120]   we were talking about him on Monday's episode.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.920]   I was excited about this sponsor is Synerd,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.600]   C-E-N-T-E-R-E-D, Synerd,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.200]   a application for productivity.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.720]   You run this software on your Mac.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.160]   You run this software on your Windows computer,
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   and it helps you do better, less distracted, deeper work.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.640]   Now, as I said, they have a few different features.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.840]   They bring all your to-dos together in one place.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.560]   They have this great library of ambient music
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.160]   to help you focus.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.880]   Their, the founder of the company I was talking to him
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.340]   was telling me people love the music, right?
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.700]   You get used to the music.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.740]   You get used to this music means it's time to work.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.600]   They have a do not disturb mode on your Mac,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.080]   which I really love.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.280]   So it keeps people from being able to bother you,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.000]   which I think is by itself worth all the money you would pay
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   for a service like this.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.760]   And it has a virtual coach that nudges you to,
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.600]   hey, wait a second,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.720]   let's bring your attention to back
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.200]   to what you're working on.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.120]   I've told you, Jesse,
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.720]   I love these type of productivity apps.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.760]   I hate this idea that productivity software
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.960]   is all about just getting quicker access to information
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.000]   and faster communication.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.600]   No, productivity software should be about
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.000]   helping you get the best work out of your brain
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.760]   to do your best work.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.820]   And that is what Synerd does.
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.560]   And look, if you're not using Synerd,
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.640]   as we talked about on Monday,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.000]   your only other option is to basically hire me
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.880]   to come stand over your shoulder and yell at you,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.920]   get deep.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.120]   Every time I see you try to check your email
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.640]   or every time I try to see you check Slack
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.600]   and no one wants that.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.560]   - It's probably not going to happen
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.800]   because you didn't do it for Will Smith.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.640]   So you're not going to do it for, you know, somebody else.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.480]   - If I didn't help Will Smith,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.200]   I'm not going to help you get more productive.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.040]   So you have no other choice, but to use Synerd.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.320]   I am very excited about this product.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.160]   I'm glad it exists.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.040]   So you can download Synerd today
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   at synerd.app/deepquestions.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.560]   Use that promo code deepquestions
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.480]   to get a free month of Synerd.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.960]   And that free month will come with
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.400]   all of the premium features.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.760]   synerd.app/deepquestions.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.840]   - All right.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.760]   Well, speaking about productivity,
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.080]   we should probably keep going here.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.520]   Let us move on to our next listener call.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.920]   - All right, the next question's from Brian from DC actually
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.280]   and it's kind of fitting 'cause he's got a question,
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.720]   goes into detail about physical versus eBooks.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.760]   And I know you brought it up before,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.480]   but he talks about some good stuff.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.040]   So let's take a listen.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   - Hi Cal, my name is Brian.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.520]   I'm a lawyer down in Washington, DC.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.000]   So I guess in a way we're neighbors.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   This question has nothing to do with my profession,
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.240]   but I heard you're looking for more questions,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.120]   so I thought I'd give this one a shot.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   I'd be curious to hear your thoughts
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.640]   on eBooks versus physical books.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.960]   Instinctually, I always prefer physical books.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.760]   I like seeing them on bookshelves.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.200]   I like the visual reminder of the books I've read
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.760]   and the thoughts I've digested.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.120]   And perhaps most importantly,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.680]   I like the idea that maybe my kids will see them
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.440]   and be exposed to them and perhaps one day decide themselves
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.880]   to read some of the books that I found influential.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.520]   I know I enjoyed doing that when I was a kid.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   But I also noticed that ever since I've dusted
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.200]   my Kindle off the shelf, I read a lot more.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.960]   I think I can read at night while I get the baby to bed.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.000]   I can take it with me more easily.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.600]   I can get library books very easily on that.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.200]   And so my volume of reading has really gone up.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.440]   I also have noticed that I'm much more into taking
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.520]   and reviewing notes since I can just export that
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.080]   when I'm done reading.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.040]   Paradoxically though, that means I very rarely,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.640]   if ever, go back and reread passages
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.280]   out of the electronic book.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.240]   Like I might in a hard copy book.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.280]   And so not a productivity question,
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.880]   but I'd be really curious in your thoughts
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.920]   on eBooks versus hard copy books.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.600]   Thanks so much.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.520]   - Well, Brian, I would say use all formats
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.400]   and don't overthink it.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.360]   I use all formats.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.720]   They all have their advantages.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.480]   If we look at the five books I read this month
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.200]   that we talked about earlier in the show,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.880]   this particular month, two of them were audio books
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.720]   and three of them were physical books.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   I would say in a typical month, maybe one audio book,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.960]   one or two Kindle books,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.000]   and then two or three physical books.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.760]   So I have a mix and I don't have a huge rhyme
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.600]   or reason for it.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.320]   I mean, I do like having a physical library.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.080]   When you have a reading habit like mine,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.160]   where you don't overthink it,
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.520]   you just grab things that are interesting.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.240]   You just, reading's better than non-reading.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.200]   I am often taking these books out of my existing library.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.600]   So if we look back at this week's,
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.040]   this month's books, for example,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.560]   two of them, two of the books I read in January,
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.720]   "Giants" by John Stauffer
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.240]   and "The Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything"
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.560]   by Father Donovan, those were just in my library.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.400]   I just looked through my library,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.240]   I want to read something else.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.520]   I just, hey, I should read this.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   I pulled it off my shelf as if I was in a real library.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.680]   So I'm a big believer in having a robust library,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.120]   not just the books you've read,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.040]   but books you want to read.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.720]   And I agree with you that it's good for your kids
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.560]   to see that and they can see books around
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.320]   and see them as a physical artifact.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.160]   But I think it's completely fine to use Kindle as well.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.680]   If you add real books to Kindle,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.520]   you're just going to read more
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.840]   and then throw audio into that as well.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.520]   You're going to read even more.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.720]   And so I will go to Kindle if,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.160]   A, I want to start a book right away
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   and don't want to wait to have it sent to me,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.840]   is one reason I'll use Kindle.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.160]   Or two, if I'm going on a trip or something
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.520]   where I don't want to bring a physical book
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.120]   or sometimes it's a book I'm not sure about,
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.800]   I want to own, maybe I'll get it on Kindle.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.200]   So I would say don't overthink it,
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.400]   use all the formats.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.240]   And how you make the decision,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   you can just do it like me,
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.680]   which is, I don't know, randomly.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.440]   And it should pretty much work out.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.600]   All right.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.560]   By the way, reading with your kid,
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.600]   putting the baby to bed,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.000]   that really resonates with me.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.200]   That's when we bought,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.600]   my wife and I bought the Kindle paper whites.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.080]   So we had Kindles that were unlit
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.960]   and it was midnight feedings.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.240]   We're like, okay, we got to get a Kindle
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.880]   that you can read while you're holding a baby
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.560]   or while you're trying to rock a baby to sleep.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.080]   And so, yeah, that brings back memories.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.480]   When I think of my Kindle mini white,
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.560]   I think about having a baby and being tired.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.680]   All right, let's move on here.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.840]   What do we got for our next question?
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.720]   - All right, this is kind of random,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.560]   but we actually have another question from Grant
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.840]   who also just moved to DC.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.000]   But he has a question about specifically
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.680]   establishing KPIs for his career goals.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.520]   - This is a tech guy, isn't it?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.720]   - He works with Google ads.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.400]   - Yeah, I know the tech guys when I hear them.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.320]   - We'll take a listen.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.400]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Grant.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   I work as a embedded software engineer.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.560]   I'm also very interested in DIY electronics
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.520]   in the maker community.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.800]   In college, it was easy for me to sit down
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.680]   and work on personal projects that involved coding,
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.080]   simple PCB and circuit design, et cetera.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.520]   Now, even though I do have mental energy
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.120]   when I end my workday,
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.480]   I find it difficult to sit down and do more coding.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.240]   You briefly mentioned coding as a hobby
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.680]   in your book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.600]   but you then go on to describe
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.680]   more traditional offline hobbies
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.720]   to get your mind off of social media and the internet.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.680]   I've tried some of these things first thing in the morning,
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.040]   but I find it to be a little bit unsustainable.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.440]   And more than that, this is supposed to be a hobby
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.520]   to take my mind off of things after work
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.480]   so that I don't end up just binging Netflix.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.120]   Is this hobby destined to fall out of my life
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.960]   just because I happen to also do something similar full time
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.000]   or is there a way I can find a happy medium
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.040]   for both personal and professional coding?
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.880]   Thanks.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.240]   - Well, Grant, that's a good question.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.720]   It hits home.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.360]   That's actually a specifically a hobby
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.600]   I'm interested in as well.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.280]   I would like to do more DIY electronics projects.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.560]   And I've actually had a hard time,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.800]   just like you, getting this up and running.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   The time just isn't there right now.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.240]   I'm finding I don't quite have the time.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.760]   I'm not getting the right momentum going.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.240]   I've had computer programming hobbies before.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.360]   So a couple of years ago,
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.520]   I used to build computer games for my older boys,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.880]   and I kind of got in a groove on that,
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.960]   computer game programming,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.000]   even though I was working on computers all day.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.960]   So I feel you.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.320]   Because I'm struggling to get the exact same hobby going
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.920]   and not haven't been that successful at it.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.360]   I have four things to suggest that might make this helpful.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.520]   Underscoring everything I'm gonna say here, however,
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.320]   is don't sweat it.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.120]   Like ultimately hobbies are hobbies, right?
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.200]   Like it's not the end of the world
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.760]   that you have this working tomorrow
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.360]   that you have your own channel on tested.com
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.200]   by next week.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.320]   It's a hobby.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.440]   Nothing bad is gonna happen if in the end,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.040]   it's you're busy or you're exhausted,
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.160]   or it's not quite clicking and nothing happens,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.000]   you're fine.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.160]   There's no bonus points for having hobbies.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.800]   It's just, you wanna do things that are interesting.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.120]   You wanna live deep.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.600]   You wanna avoid the shallow distractions.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.880]   Okay, so let's not sweat.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.760]   Like we have to get this hobby up and going right away.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.640]   But here's four things that would help.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.840]   One is project choice.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.040]   I think that really matters.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.360]   For me, when I struggle with a new hobby,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.840]   it's I don't have the right project that has gripped me.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   And so nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.440]   And the right project grips me
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.480]   and I find myself fighting to make time to work on it.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.960]   I definitely had this experience
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.120]   with the computer game programming projects
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.960]   I would be doing.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   It had to be the right level of difficulty.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.600]   If it was too hard, nothing would happen.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.920]   If it was too easy, I'd be bored.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.040]   But if it was the right level of difficulty,
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.680]   I'd have to force myself to get started.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.000]   But then I would begin to make some progress.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.240]   And then I would find myself putting aside time
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.560]   just to work on it, like looking forward to like,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.160]   okay, you're putting the kids to bed tonight,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.560]   then I'm gonna go work on the program.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.520]   So it was all about having the right product,
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.520]   the right project.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.600]   Like the last game I did, for example,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.480]   was I wanted to do a ray casting 3D engine.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.160]   I was using Python and using the PyGames library
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.080]   for some simple low performance graphics, right?
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.360]   And I wanted to make a game where my boys could
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.320]   in 2D create a maze, and then you could jump
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.120]   into that maze in 3D and actually try to navigate it.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.800]   So I had to build a 3D engine
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.080]   so you could actually build the maze.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.360]   I was like, let me just do a Wolfenstein 3D style
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.880]   ray casting engine where you literally are casting rays
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.120]   from the virtual camera location
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.560]   and seeing where it hits walls
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.760]   and how far away that wall is.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.680]   So we can figure out how high to draw
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.000]   that particular piece of the wall.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   There's a lot of geometry, basically.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.560]   Slow, slow, slow until I got that first screen
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.000]   of something is drawing that kind of looks 3D.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.280]   And then I couldn't not work on it.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.720]   So project selection, don't underestimate that.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.840]   That's my issue right now with Maker electronics.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.000]   I don't have the right project with the right equipment
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.560]   where like I know how to do it
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.800]   and I can see progress right away.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.200]   I just don't have the right project yet,
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.480]   but I think it's gonna roll quick when I do.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.640]   Two, community.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.360]   Get connected, if possible, to a community of people
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.200]   who are working on this.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.120]   That changes a lot.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.280]   I'm sure there's robust Maker communities
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.800]   in the Washington DC area.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.360]   You get involved with some other people
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.680]   that have some equipment, you make it social as well.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.040]   That makes all the difference in the world.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.200]   Start one up and I'll come to it.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.760]   Okay, how about that?
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.480]   You get it going and I will come to it
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.560]   and we'll build some DIY electronics.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.880]   Work less would be my third recommendation.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.040]   So yeah, do less work at work.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.360]   Give yourself some more surplus energy.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.080]   I know that's a bold thing to say in the abstract,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.480]   but here on this podcast, we know how to get that done.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.960]   I mean, we know how to actually apply
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.920]   time management theories that actually
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.320]   are incredibly effective.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   Go back, go to the YouTube channel,
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.840]   watch the Core Ideas video from the Core Ideas playlist
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.400]   on time management and I will walk you through
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.280]   the principles of how I organize my time.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.240]   If you're doing those type of things,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.840]   you can claw back a bunch of time
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.520]   and still as far as your bosses are concerned,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.520]   be an incredibly productive person that they can count on.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.960]   Don't be worried about doing that.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.280]   Don't be ashamed about doing that.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.240]   If you get more productive, that is your benefit.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.040]   You know, if right now you're producing work
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.160]   that everyone's happy with and you find a way to do that
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   in two less hours a day, that is not a problem.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.920]   That is a benefit you should cash in on.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.480]   So consider working less.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.600]   Take some projects off your plate
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.360]   and get much more organized about the work you have.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.240]   Free up more energy, more time
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.160]   so that you have that energy and time
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.080]   to actually work on the project.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.520]   And finally, do the physical first.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   The number one hobby you need to do,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.360]   and by hobby I mean activity outside of work,
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.840]   is make sure you have a lot of physical activity.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.920]   You're outside, you're moving, you're exercising,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.840]   you're training for something,
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.520]   just like I was talking about earlier in the show
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.000]   that I'm doing in my own life right now for The Last Caller.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.560]   Do that too because that's a separation
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.120]   between your work and your non-work life
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.760]   and it's gonna get your energy back up much higher
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.040]   than if you're just coming home from work
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.200]   and sitting on the couch and saying,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.400]   I guess I should bring out another screen.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.000]   All right, so those would be the four things
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.600]   I would suggest, but all of this is built
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   on the underlying foundation of don't over-sweat this.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.680]   If you're really busy right now,
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.760]   if you're really tired right now,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.480]   if you're really mentally struggling with whatever,
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.880]   pandemic, et cetera, it's okay.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.840]   It's okay, we'll take our time.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.880]   I'm taking my time, you're taking your time.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.080]   We'll give ourselves a few months,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.880]   but then I wanna be in a really cool maker lab
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.840]   that you ran building cool electronics.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.560]   All right, that was Grant.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.720]   All right, Jesse, let's see what we got here.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.760]   What's our next question?
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.800]   - All right, our next call is from Jacqueline.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.080]   She basically has a question about asking for help
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.800]   and how you go about it.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:20.040]   - Hi, Cal, thanks so much for your podcast.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.400]   It's helped me so much.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.760]   Almost every day I refer to something that you've said
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.440]   in your podcast, in conversation with other folks.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.200]   I really appreciate listening to your outlook on life,
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   especially your sense of gratitude
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.760]   and lack of shaming.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.480]   So I was really interested in your discussion
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.000]   with David Epstein in episode 39
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.240]   about people being hindered by their own expertise or ego
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   and how these can keep people from asking questions
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.520]   or asking for help.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.640]   My question is about how you approach this problem.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.160]   What is your mindset when you are asking questions
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.680]   or asking for help?
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.160]   Do you fear looking stupid?
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.800]   If so, how do you deal with that?
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.480]   Also at a more technical level, how do you get help?
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.400]   For example, how do you know when to reach out,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.800]   who to reach out to,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   and how to get what you need from that interaction?
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.360]   Just quickly, I consider this a productivity question
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.240]   because I think my inability to ask for help
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.520]   has been slowing my ability to get anything done.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.960]   My PhD took me roughly nine years
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.760]   and now I'm still having trouble publishing chapters
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.360]   of my dissertation.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.080]   I have the mindset that I should figure things out
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.480]   for myself and I'm also scared of looking stupid.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.200]   I think asking for help would help,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.840]   but I haven't quite figured it out yet.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.960]   Thanks so much.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.640]   - All right, Jaclyn, I like this question.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.720]   Let me set your mind at ease.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.240]   I'm a relatively smart guy
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.720]   and I ask for help constantly in all areas of my life.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.440]   And here's why I feel comfortable doing that.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.760]   So you can learn from my experience here.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.000]   I had, I guess you could call it the privilege
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.440]   or you could call it the lack of luck,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.560]   depending on how it's gonna impact your mindset,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.160]   but whatever it is, I got a train at a place
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.000]   that were surrounded by the very smartest people
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.280]   in the world, right?
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.560]   So I was at MIT in the theory group at MIT,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.600]   literally the smartest people in the world.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   I could throw a stone and hit three Turing Award winners
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.200]   and three MacArthur Genius Grant Award winners,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   one of whom who won the MacArthur when he was 17
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.920]   and had been a tenured professor at MIT since he was 18.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.960]   Incredibly smart people, not just, oh, that guy's sharp,
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.600]   but their brain can move things by staring at it.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.080]   They ask questions all the time.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.120]   Like completely the smartest people in the world
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   will use phrases such as pretend like I am a child
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.920]   and explain this to me.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.800]   They are the very first people to say at a talk,
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.240]   whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't know what that word means
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.520]   you just said, wait, slow way down, slow way down.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.800]   Like, I don't understand that equation.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.640]   Why is that right?
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.360]   Like, slow it down for me, assume I don't know anything.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.480]   It was the defining factor of the very smartest people
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.080]   in the world is that without any shame,
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.680]   they are constantly, constantly asking for people
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.720]   to slow down, to explain things simply.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.680]   And they're constantly faced with people
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.840]   who go way too fast because they're intimidated
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.440]   and say, well, this person's so smart,
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.280]   they're gonna think I'm dumb.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.440]   And they don't want you to go fast.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   They want you to go real slow.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.200]   You wanna understand each piece
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.520]   before they move on to the next.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.360]   So to me, that was incredibly instructive.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.840]   Now, the reason why, of course,
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.120]   they don't care about doing that
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.080]   is that they know they're smart.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.480]   They literally have a certificate that says genius
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.400]   and the 600,000 that comes along with that fellowship.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.600]   So they know they're smart.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.480]   So they don't care about trying to look smart.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.680]   So by studying the smartest people in the world,
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.080]   you say, what is probably the right thing to do?
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.320]   And it turns out it's to ask questions all the time.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.800]   And so it's not a flaw with you
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.400]   if you don't understand something
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.600]   or someone's explaining something very confidently,
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.240]   like, I didn't get that.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   Nine times out of 10,
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.480]   it's not because you're missing something,
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.120]   it's because they're going way too fast
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.920]   and they're just trying to look smart.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.880]   This effect is so powerful that you can then,
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.360]   if you've been around these types of super brains,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.800]   it becomes a counter signaling situation.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.640]   When you see someone not asking for help
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.280]   or acting like everything is obvious
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.360]   or explaining something really fast,
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.200]   you immediately think,
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.160]   "Ooh, that person's probably not that sharp.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.640]   Like that person's compensating for something.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.320]   That person is really worried
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.920]   about what people think about them."
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.800]   So it becomes a counter signaling effect.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.080]   The more questions you ask,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.600]   the smarter you actually seem.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.360]   So Jacqueline, I'm gonna say
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.840]   you learn from that experience.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.280]   If you want to actually live in the world
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.160]   like a smart person,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.520]   ask questions about everything you don't understand.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.040]   And when you don't know how to do something right,
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.200]   ask questions about that.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.560]   I do this all the time.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.040]   I call people, I'm known for this at Georgetown.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.640]   If I'm put on a committee for something,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.240]   I was like, "I have no idea how this works.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.400]   Like, what do I need to do?"
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.520]   I just like, "Let me just hold on, dial my phone.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.720]   You know, hi, I'm dumb.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.480]   I have no idea how any of this works.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.320]   No, no, slow down even more.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.400]   Like, I gotta put, I was doing this recently
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.680]   where it started a new academic program I'm involved in.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.160]   And I had someone,
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.520]   I had to do this with someone from the registrar's office.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.880]   I was like, "Just start from scratch.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.200]   I don't even know what that system is.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.440]   What do you mean major?
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.520]   Like, just pretend I am 12."
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.720]   And then I did this the other day.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.760]   I had to call the admissions department
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.600]   because they needed to turn something on.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.360]   I was like, "Look, just start from scratch.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.640]   I don't know anything."
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.400]   And it's really useful to everyone involved.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.080]   Everyone always pretends like they understand things.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.920]   No one understands anything.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.440]   So Jacqueline, that is the mindset you should be in.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.640]   By asking the most fundamental questions
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.920]   about how things work or why something is true,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.440]   you are going to be setting yourself up
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.200]   for having the very smartest insights
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.040]   and the very best work.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.600]   And when it comes to help, ask for it.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.360]   "Hey, I'm having a hard time writing my chapters.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.600]   Like, let's talk about it.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.200]   I need help."
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.560]   Talk to your old advisors, talk to people you know.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.400]   "What's going on here?
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.240]   Should I rethink this?
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.360]   Should I change my habits?"
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.440]   Be in that habit.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   I'm glad you asked this
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.880]   because I want everyone to be in this habit.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.520]   Ask for help all the time.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.320]   That is what's going to make you paradoxically seem
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.040]   way smarter than the guy on the other side of the room
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.520]   trying to play it cool and is fooling nobody.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.760]   The guy who's trying to desperately make it seem like,
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.640]   "I guess I know everything and I understand everything."
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.920]   No one is fooled by that person.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.320]   It is slowing down their ability to have original thoughts
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.520]   or get useful things done.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.240]   Ignore that person.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.520]   Ask questions.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.200]   If I do it, if those supersized brains at MIT were doing it,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.320]   then you should feel absolutely secure doing it yourself.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.800]   That being said, whenever Jesse asks me for help,
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.640]   I yell at him.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.720]   But that's more of like a discipline thing.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.920]   If you don't know how to do this,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.000]   then maybe you don't belong here.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.200]   That's what I say constantly.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.680]   - Take your $250,000 a month out of here.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.520]   - Yeah, what are you doing with that?
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.360]   - Buy a pull-up bar.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.240]   - What do you do with that $250,000 a month?
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.040]   I know you're not putting it into your truck.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.000]   I know that's not where you're investing it.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.120]   Go get our pull-up bar installed.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.600]   What the hell's going on here?
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.880]   All right.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.320]   Let's move on now.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.240]   We have time for two more questions.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.280]   Okay, let's get another question.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.120]   I think we have time.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:29.960]   Who do we have here?
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.400]   - All right, next question we have,
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.200]   it's basically about the deep life during the pandemic
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.480]   and he's a student.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   So he's got a good question for you.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.520]   - There's a pandemic?
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.960]   That's the first I'm hearing of this.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   - I'm Mukul.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.520]   I'm a long time listener of your podcast.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.760]   I'm a college student.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.120]   Last year when the pandemic hits,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.840]   I moved back to my home.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.960]   Throughout the pandemic,
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.280]   my life become way more structured.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.160]   I took your 30 day social media challenge,
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.240]   removed social media completely
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.320]   from my life after that challenge.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.880]   I really started to enjoy deep life,
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.320]   but now colleges are opening back again
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.000]   and I moved back to the university.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.160]   The structure which I implemented in my life
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.600]   during the pandemic is completely trashed away.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.800]   I tried time blocking to add the structure again,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.600]   but my classes are not properly scheduled
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.200]   and most of the time they are random.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.160]   This left me small chunks of time,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.760]   but I cannot figure out a way to use those small chunks
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.320]   and mostly waste that time on YouTube.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.080]   This led to me a burnout feeling throughout the day.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.880]   These days I'm mostly stressed out
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.000]   and just looking forward to the weekend.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.240]   I really want to add the structure in my life again
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.320]   and enjoy this deep life.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   Any suggestions how can I implement
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.960]   the structure back again to my life?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.920]   - Well, your old structure's not gonna work,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.400]   but you're gonna build a new structure that does.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.400]   So yes, whatever deep life structure that was working
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.920]   when you were at home, it's not gonna work at school,
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.000]   but there is plenty of options for deep life structures
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.680]   at school that will work.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.000]   So I have a few pieces of advice for you.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.120]   Number one, I want you to autopilot schedule
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.880]   the hell out of your schedule.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.240]   So autopilot scheduling was invented originally
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.960]   for college students and the idea is you look
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.640]   at each one of your classes and you identify
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   what is work that has to get done every single week
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.440]   or every single month, what sort of work happens regularly
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.040]   for these classes, problem sets that have to be solved,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.960]   reading assignments that have to happen,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.640]   essay prompts that have to be written,
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.600]   and you say, when and where do I do that work every week?
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.880]   And that goes on your calendar like a dentist appointment
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.800]   or another class, it's in time
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.320]   that you are not gonna violate,
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.320]   this is just when I do that work.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.920]   And you do that for all of your classes
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.000]   and now you can move these around like a puzzle piece
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.240]   and figure out what's a pretty good sustainable schedule
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.800]   for my work and more importantly,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.240]   you're not asking every day, what should I do and when?
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.880]   That's all figured out.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.400]   All right, so you're gonna autopilot schedule
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.840]   and then you are gonna upgrade your study skills
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.520]   so that you're not wasting time by spinning your wheels
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.960]   with inefficient study habits.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.600]   I don't want you spending more time than you need to.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.000]   So go back and read "How to Become a Straight A Student",
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.120]   walk through that advice to completely overhaul
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.960]   your study habits.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.600]   The other thing you can do is go to my blog,
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.920]   calnewport.com/blog and read the first two years
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.440]   worth of posts, 2007, 2008.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.720]   It's all advanced study advice for college students.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.200]   I want you to reduce the wasted time doing your schoolwork.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   So that's step one.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:44.180]   Now let's say you've done that and you still have no time.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.800]   You say, I figured out autopilot schedule,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.400]   prom sets, reading assignments, prompts
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.520]   and my whole calendar is filled up and I still,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.680]   and I have no time left except for the weekends.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.080]   All right, step two, under schedule.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.800]   Drop stuff off your schedule, drop some classes,
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.940]   simplify your load.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.400]   Even if you're going under the load,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.880]   you need probably to graduate,
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.040]   do it for a semester or two as you're trying to get back
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.760]   on your feet after the pandemic.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.360]   Whatever you do, do not try to super overload your schedule.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.160]   You need to step away from the mindset
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.000]   that the job market or the graduate school market
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.480]   a couple of years down the line is gonna say,
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   look at how hard Mookle semester was in the spring of 2022.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.660]   That's a really hard semester, we really like them.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.840]   They don't look at that, no one cares.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.680]   They're like, what's your major?
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.500]   What are your grades?
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.800]   Simplify your schedule, under schedule,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.360]   cut things out of your schedule
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   until your autopilot schedule fits with plenty of room.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.480]   That means dropping classes, dropping activities,
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.440]   swapping classes for easier classes.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.120]   You need breathing room.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.160]   So if you're autopiloting with smart schedules
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.000]   and you're properly under scheduled,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.860]   you're gonna find yourself now with some breathing room,
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.840]   which is what you absolutely need.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.520]   Now I want you to reinvent your leisure time
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.480]   and get involved in some sort of high quality
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.420]   leisure activity, preferably involving other human beings.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.740]   They're also on the college campus,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.320]   something that you can really get into.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.860]   It could be exercise related, it could be writing related
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.300]   or theatrical, artistic related,
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.700]   but something you can really get into
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.460]   for no other reason than you like it
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.740]   that other people are involved in
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.720]   and that can really start to funnel your energy
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.960]   away from YouTube.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.440]   The only YouTube I want in your life
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.180]   is looking at my channel so you can watch my videos.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.040]   And I don't mean to be strict about this,
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.760]   but I only want you doing that for,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.960]   let's say three hours a day.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.780]   No more than that, three hours a day watching my videos,
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.880]   maybe another two hours trying to convince people
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.760]   you know to subscribe.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.260]   But that five hours is the only five hours
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.800]   I want you spending on YouTube.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.380]   The final thing I'm gonna recommend, thing number four,
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.700]   I want you to Google,
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.520]   I don't have the link off the top of my head,
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.060]   but there's a series I did on my blog
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.720]   back when I was aimed at students
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.360]   called the Romantic Scholar.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.360]   And so you can just Google calnewport.com romantic scholar.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.700]   And it was a series about how do you reconstruct
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.640]   your college lifestyle so that you have
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.140]   an intrinsically motivated deep interest
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.640]   in the work you're doing as a student.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.080]   How can you rewire your relationship to your schoolwork
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.720]   so it's not this thing that's intrinsically
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.200]   being imposed upon you that's causing stress and burnout,
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.760]   but instead something that's a deep part
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.040]   of your self-definition and a real source
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.320]   of interest and motivation.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.440]   And it has a lot of advice about how you do that.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.960]   And I want you to read that series and put that into,
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.220]   put that into action.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.720]   This is a hard transition for a lot of students.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.480]   The pandemic was incredibly disruptive.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.300]   Coming back to school after the pandemic
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.180]   is really disruptive.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.600]   It's not just let's load up our schedule
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.680]   and get after it and do 17 majors and, you know,
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   and just grind it and something good will happen.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.120]   We have to take this transition with care.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.520]   I like that you're thinking about using this transition
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.340]   as a way to preserve depth in your life.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.480]   That's my advice to do it.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.580]   So here's a quick summary.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.000]   Autopilot schedule plus smarter study habits.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.360]   If you're still overloaded, under schedule.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.120]   Quit, reduce course load, switch to easier courses.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:10.960]   Once you've done that,
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.720]   get involved in a deep leisure activity
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.000]   that involves other human beings,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.380]   and four, read my Romantic Scholar series on my blog
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.440]   and take those ideas to heart.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.360]   You do that plus five quick hours
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.740]   of working on my YouTube channel every day.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.800]   Those two things, I think we're all gonna be
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.740]   much better off.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.760]   Now, speaking about being better off,
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.500]   Jesse, there's a couple of the sponsors
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.360]   I wanna briefly mention
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.000]   before we get to our last question today.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.600]   And the first one is a long time favorite of the show,
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.940]   which is Magic Spoon.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.440]   As you've heard me talk about before,
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.840]   I used to love eating those type of treat cereals
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.420]   that were popular in the 80s.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:54.120]   Now that I'm a grown man pushing 40
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.720]   and realize that those cereals are made out of 50%
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.440]   old used industrial waste oils,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.640]   plus wood filling and sawdust,
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.560]   that is actually probably not very good for me to eat that.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   That's where Magic Spoon enters the picture.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.720]   It's a great tasting cereal with flavors like
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.080]   cocoa, fruity, frosted, peanut butter,
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.600]   blueberry, cinnamon, cookies, and cream,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.480]   but it's not bad for you.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.360]   Zero grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein,
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.640]   and only four net grams of carbs in each serving,
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.040]   only 140 calories a serving.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.640]   It's keto friendly, gluten-free,
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.480]   grain-free, soy-free, and low carb.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.080]   You can build custom bundles of the flavors you like.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.040]   Our esteemed producer, Jesse,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.420]   is a Magic Spoon cereal consumer.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.520]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Jesse,
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.400]   it is the only food you eat.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.600]   Is that right?
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.280]   - That is not true, but I do really like it.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.600]   I like the peanut butter the best.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.480]   - Yeah, and as we talked about on Monday's episode,
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.720]   pro tip, mix the peanut butter with the cocoa.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.520]   To get those two flavors in your custom bundle,
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.440]   you got Reese's Flavor Cereal.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.640]   Can't go wrong.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.480]   So go to magicspoon.com/cal
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.960]   to grab a custom bundle of cereal
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.640]   and start your new year off right.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.600]   Use the promo code CAL, C-A-L,
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.520]   when you check out and you will get $5 off your order.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.960]   Magic Spoon is very confident in their product,
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.400]   so it has a 100% happiness guarantee.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.000]   If you don't like it for any reason,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.480]   they'll refund your money and send that cereal
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.880]   to Jesse to eat.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.280]   No questions asked.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.020]   So remember, get your next delicious bowl
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.480]   of guilt-free cereal at magicspoon.com/cal
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   and use that code CAL to get $5 off.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.840]   Also want to talk about ExpressVPN.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.000]   Jesse has heard my computer scientist lectures before
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   about how a VPN works.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.100]   He could probably explain it well himself now.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.340]   Jesse, I should put you on the spot
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.500]   and ask you incredibly complicated questions
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:00.500]   about packet filters and IP proxies.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.460]   We'll do like 20 minutes of intense questioning
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.300]   on VPN technology.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.140]   Are we ready for this?
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.820]   - And then you'll lose all your YouTube subscribers
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.740]   and your fans.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.940]   - And my sponsors.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.860]   Okay, all right, so we won't do that.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.380]   We'll let the computer scientist tell you,
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.260]   take it from me, you can trust me,
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.140]   you should be using a VPN,
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.180]   especially when you're away from your house.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.980]   It is a way of securely connecting to a VPN computer
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.780]   that then talks to the internet on your behalf.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.460]   So people nearby don't know who you're talking to and why.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.640]   There's a lot of reasons to do this.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.060]   You can do this for privacy is one of the big reasons.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.340]   Your ISP can't figure out who you're talking to or why,
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.340]   but ExpressVPN sent me some copy
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:43.340]   about a really cool bonus feature of using a VPN,
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   which is you can get around geographic restrictions
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.420]   on content.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.940]   Netflix, for example, shows different content
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.980]   depending on where you're connecting from.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.860]   So if you're an ExpressVPN user,
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.100]   you can connect to a VPN server in a different country
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.460]   and then connect to Netflix from that server
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.900]   and Netflix thinks you're in that country
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.380]   and will show you that country's content.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.940]   ExpressVPN has over 100 different server locations.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.340]   So you can try this trick with a lot of different locations.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.420]   So that's just a bonus feature you have for using a VPN.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.500]   And if you're gonna use a VPN, use ExpressVPN.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.020]   They've got the most server locations.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.240]   This is why I like them and they're fast.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.160]   You have to have that bandwidth.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.840]   I also like how easily it integrates into my machines.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.500]   Very simple to use.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.580]   You turn it on, select a server,
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.900]   and then you just load up Netflix,
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.220]   load up your browser, and it's fast.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.920]   You don't even realize that you're going through a VPN.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.860]   So you should use a VPN.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.820]   And if you do, make it ExpressVPN.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.020]   And if you have any questions, don't ask Jesse, ask me.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.900]   I am the expert on this technology.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.420]   So be smart and stop paying full price
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.520]   for streaming services and only getting access
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.660]   to a fraction of their content.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.660]   Get your money's worth at expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:13.340]   Don't forget to use my link at expressvpn.com/deep
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:18.700]   to get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.820]   All right, Jesse, I think we have time
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.060]   for one last question.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.700]   So let's see what we have here.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.340]   - All right, the last question is a new father
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.820]   and he's got some questions about managing that
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.220]   and doing some deep work.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.740]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Judd
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.740]   and I'm a longtime fan of your work.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.680]   In a recent podcast, you said nothing has negatively impacted
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.760]   your productivity as much as being a new parent.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.980]   I'm a father of two children under the age of two
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.060]   and I'm experiencing the same thing.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.800]   Do you have any tips for parents of babies
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.660]   to help navigate the challenges of being a new parent?
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.280]   While I love being a father, the sleepless nights
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.620]   and near constant attention the girls require
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.500]   have seriously reduced my ability to do deep work.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.500]   They've also killed my creativity and ability
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.760]   to come up with Greek mythological references,
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.260]   for which I apologize.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.680]   Thanks so much, I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.180]   - Well, I mean, I think in order to reprioritize
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.060]   mythological references,
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.460]   toddler boarding school is what we need.
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.460]   Where you send off your daughters,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.280]   they'll come back for the summers and for the holidays
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.660]   and then you can really focus
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.480]   on good mythological references.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.560]   No, Judd, I think it is, there are seasons.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   And there's a big idea from slow productivity.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.740]   Seasonality at multiple scales,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.820]   from the week to the month,
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.680]   through the years to multiple years.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.640]   Two young kids under two, this is a season
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.540]   in which you're not writing the great American novel.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.960]   I think that's okay.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.700]   Life is long.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.560]   You have babies.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.780]   It's batting down the hatches time.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.900]   Now I had seasons like that, obviously with young kids.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.660]   I had a season, I think the pandemic
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.340]   caused some seasonality for me.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.980]   Our schools were closed, there's chaos
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.420]   and I had to pull back on a lot of things
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.500]   and in the grand scheme of things,
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.100]   I think that's reasonable.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.260]   That was a slow season.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.540]   Different seasons are different.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.060]   I mean, when my kids finally all go off to college,
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.900]   I know exactly how old I'll be when that happens.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.980]   We've done this math, trust me.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.560]   I'm either going to explode
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.720]   into a frenzy of productive output.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.180]   I'll be writing three books a year or I'll just die.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.020]   It'll be one of the two.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.900]   I'll either just be at the end of the finish line and die
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.620]   or I'm gonna be writing three books a year or something.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.900]   And I see different seasons are different.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.180]   So first of all, I just wanna give you that,
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.780]   I wanna give you that reassurance.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.200]   I think it's fine to slow down
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.820]   and this is a very important thing in your life.
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.280]   Give it some focus.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.000]   Now, keep a handle on the other things.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.260]   You don't want the work you have to do
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.860]   to become a major source of stress right now.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.720]   So go watch my core ideas video
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.220]   on time management, for example,
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.980]   and make sure that you have a ship shape
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.460]   organizational system so that you have
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.780]   the breathing room necessary to not work so much
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.340]   and not have it be a crisis.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.760]   The only other advice I'll give,
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.620]   and I gotta be wary about giving parenting advice.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.700]   I get yelled at a lot, but I gotta tell you, sleep training.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.540]   And don't yell at me, anti-sleep training people,
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.980]   but you've got two kids, you guys both work,
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.520]   you gotta do sleep training, right?
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.120]   I'm very trepidatious.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.380]   Jesse can say I look very trepidatious
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.940]   because the parenting advice gets you in a lot of trouble.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.440]   If your strategy is just, I think eventually
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.700]   the kid will figure it out and start sleeping,
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.640]   they will torture your soul and they'll fake you out
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   and they'll start sleeping more.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.160]   And then you'll all be high-fiving
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.480]   and telling your friends how good you are,
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.000]   like your kids are good sleepers.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.880]   And then they'll just twist a knife
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.660]   and start getting up at four and getting up at two
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.680]   and getting up at nine.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.000]   And so this was my wife and I's survival strategy
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.880]   is we're doing a lot for these kids,
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.560]   but these kids need to do one thing for us.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.720]   And that is they're gonna have to go
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.600]   through some sleep training.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.560]   So don't put up with four years of not sleeping.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.340]   A lot of people do.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.020]   You could make that four months
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.120]   if you're willing to think about sleep training.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.600]   Any complaints about that, that always upsets parents.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.440]   So you can send all your complaints
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   to jesse@calnewport.com and really, really let me have it.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.760]   But send those to jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   All right, Judd, well, good luck and congratulations.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.480]   And yeah, go easy on yourself and look into sleep training.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.000]   All right, Jesse, I think that's all the time
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.760]   we have for this episode.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.920]   Thank you everyone who called.
