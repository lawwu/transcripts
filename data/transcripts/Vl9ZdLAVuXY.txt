[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   All right, let's see here. We got a written question from Sam.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   Sam asked, "What is the potential of AI in productivity optimization and how will it work?"
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   Well, my theory on this, my prediction on this, maybe I say my optimistic or
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.440]   wistful hope for the role of AI in the future of work is going to be the AI chief of staff.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.840]   So I've long argued this is the natural terminal point for the intersection of AI with, in
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.480]   particular, knowledge work or office work, is being able to implement in software something
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.960]   like a chief of staff role, but for many more positions than we could ever afford to actually
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.840]   have chief of staff. So obviously, we think of chief of staff, it's a prominent role in political
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.920]   life. The president of the United States famously has a chief of staff. West Wing fans know about
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.600]   Leo McGarry on the West Wing. And they really manage the president's life. You never see the
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.840]   president, if you watch the West Wing, you never see Martin Sheen's character looking at calendars
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.720]   or going through email or trying to figure out what should I be working on. The chief of staff
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.640]   comes in, okay, here's what you're doing next. All right, now we have to go meet with this person.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.800]   Okay, I need you to read this. Read this briefing packet, you're going to need it when we meet with
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.600]   the joint chief of staff later or whatever, right? That idea then made its way into the business
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.160]   world. A lot of it is big in Silicon Valley, a lot of big Silicon Valley CEO and entrepreneur
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.520]   investor types, hire chief of staff to help organize these parts of their lives so they
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.080]   could focus more on actually where they add value. There's this little insider, Cal Newport tidbit,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.360]   but if you look at the back of So Good They Can't Ignore You, my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.120]   I have a blurb from Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and it's a big investment fund now,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.600]   is one of the PayPal mafia types from way back when. I have that blurb because my long time and
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   good friend Ben Kastnoka at the time was Reid Hoffman's chief of staff. And that's how Ben got
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.400]   started in the Silicon Valley world. Anyways, AI might make these accessible to individuals.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.480]   So in this vision, your AI chief of staff entirely implemented in software, it's a software agent,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   helps you actually organize your work day to the extent that you no longer are in email,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.080]   you're no longer even really looking at calendars. It is communicating with other AI agents,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.720]   figuring out what you should be working on, getting you the materials you need,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.360]   helping to figure out your day so that like the president of the United States, when you come into
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   your office, your AI agent is like, "Look, I know you're working on whatever, this initiative,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.840]   this report you're writing, I've gathered resources for you. They're in this folder over here.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.000]   By the way, there's a couple of meetings we put on your calendar for this afternoon because
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.480]   so and so need to meet you this, but don't worry, they're in the calendar. I'll get you the
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   information when we get there. And then in the afternoon, you need to check in on X, Y, and Z
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.320]   later. Don't worry, when we get there, I'll load up the information you need to remind you where
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.800]   we are and tell you where that information needs to go. Oh, at the end of the day, we need to sign
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.440]   these things," or whatever, right? You know what I'm talking about? AI will be able to do that.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.880]   And it will leave cognitively skilled knowledge workers to spend most of their time actually
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.640]   applying their hardware skills to adding value to information, like doing the fundamental act,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.240]   the fundamental act of knowledge work, economic value creation. And I think that will be
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.160]   transformative for that economic sector. I think that will increase the output. So the value created
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   per skilled knowledge worker will increase by a factor of two to five. This is going to be so
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.000]   powerful that it might have unexpected negative ramifications. If we become that much more
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.440]   productive, we might actually see reductions in how many people we need to run various industrial
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   knowledge sectors. Anyway, this will be, I think, the future of AI enhanced productivity. It's not
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.080]   just speculation. I've talked to CEOs of knowledge work AI companies that talk about this as being
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.600]   the goal. AI agents that talk to other people's AI agents and help organize your workday.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.000]   So it's possible that AI is going to eliminate this world of hyperactive hive mind,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   overhead spiraling, constant communication collaboration that afflicts us today.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:53.840]   The fact that we have to do that all on behalf of ourselves is perhaps a temporary dark period
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.880]   in the history of this economic sector. And maybe AI will be part of the solution.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.720]   Before we get there, I will just add, we can solve a lot of these problems even without that
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   technology, just through more structured processes and more intelligent approaches to how we
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800]   collaborate. And this is what my book, A World Without Email is all about. So we don't have to
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   wait for the AI chiefs of staff to free ourselves from this unproductive overhead. We can start
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.240]   making changes right now, but eventually whether or not we make those changes in our processes,
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.520]   AI, I think will save us.
