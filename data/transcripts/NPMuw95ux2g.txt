[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Currently, the Tesla fleet for the MIT Autonomous Vehicle Technology Study
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.960]   includes the Model S and the Model X.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.320]   But we're here today in our first Model 3 that we're going to instrument and add to the study.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.960]   It has the same sensor suite as the same autopilot hardware 2 in this vehicle as it does in the
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.560]   Model S and the Model X. And as far as we can tell, the compute resources and the algorithms
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.680]   performing the autonomous steering in this car is the same as in the Model S and the Model X.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.960]   The Model 3 is a really interesting car to add to our study because it has the same kind of
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.200]   autonomous technology as does the Model S and the Model X, but is more affordable, therefore
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   allowing a larger number of people to use this technology.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   However, on the instrumentation side, there's a few challenges.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.960]   To instrument this vehicle, we first need to place our sensors and run our wires
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.920]   to our rider recording box. This box also requires power and can to function.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.560]   Since this vehicle does not have an OBD2 port, we need to find other means of both powering
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.880]   our box as well as collecting CAN data.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.280]   There are multiple methods for powering our rider recording box.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   One is to use external power from a battery.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.600]   A second is to use a 12-volt auxiliary outlet, much like the cigarette outlet,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.680]   in the center console to power it.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.680]   A third method is to find the 12-volt battery source in this vehicle and run power directly
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160]   from it so that we have constant power.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.280]   Do you think we'll figure it out?
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.640]   Of course.
