[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   - As people think about causes they wanna support,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.920]   what advice do you have for people when they find a cause
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.900]   in actually finding the right organization?
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.920]   - It starts with finding causes
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.060]   that you're passionate about,
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.360]   learning about those causes, educating yourself,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.540]   and then trying to research organizations
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.520]   that are well-run and are transparent.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.040]   People just wanna know where their money's going.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.240]   They want transparency in that.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   If I told your listeners today
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.040]   that the greatest need at Charity Water
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.000]   was a new expensive copy machine
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.560]   because we needed to print a bunch of paper copies
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.880]   and it was gonna be $3,000 or something,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360]   people would donate for a copy machine to meet a need,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.520]   to meet a specific need
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   if they knew how that would move the mission forward.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880]   It's the not knowing where the money goes.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.180]   It's the fine print during many of the disasters
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.600]   where you find out actually $100 million that was given
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.160]   went into an endowment, which won't see the light of day
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.320]   because in that fine print, the organizations say,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.000]   well, if we over-raise what we can spend,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.920]   we can do anything with this money.
