[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   All right, what do we got for question number two?
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.880]   All right, next question is from Avi.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.840]   Some weeks I'm very motivated to do work and I feel so good.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.640]   On others, I just don't feel like it.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.600]   This leads to negative emotions and I completely lose the motivation to do work and indulge
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.920]   in pointless social media.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.640]   Do you have some advice on how I can keep doing the good work every day in slow but
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040]   steady manner?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.640]   Well, this is another prime example of why just focusing on productivity is not in itself
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   a sustainable strategy.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.600]   So if all you're working on is I'm doing the right organizational things, I have my multi-scale
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.640]   plan, I'm time blocking every day, strategic to weekly to daily, you could be doing all
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.160]   the things, have all the tools, have all the rules.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.960]   That alone is not going to make you fulfilled and feel like you're accomplishing things
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720]   and being excited about work every day.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.040]   That's what's happening with Avi here.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.400]   His extended answer or his extended version of the question, he talked about, "Hey, I
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.280]   do all your things, all your productivity things."
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.480]   But he still will just fall out of like, "I don't really want to work on this," and lose
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.960]   whole weeks in the spirals of self-doubt as he spends more and more time on social media,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960]   et cetera.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.120]   So again, this is the sort of necessary but not sufficient precondition type situation.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.560]   Productivity, these tactics are going to really be a nice precondition for a sustainable,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.840]   accomplished deep life, but they're not sufficient on their own.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.280]   So Avi, let's try to go forward and fix your problem here.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.640]   I think the issue is either your mind doesn't trust your plan or your mind doesn't like
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   your plan.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.920]   I mean, this is what causes people to just stop working and get lost for three days on
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   social media.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.240]   Either the thing you're working on, your mind says, "This is not going to work.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.720]   We're spending all this time on whatever, like our influencer YouTube channel, and it's
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   not good.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.840]   And we're not going to become famous, and it's not going to pay our bill, or we're writing
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.240]   this novel, or there's business ideas.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.360]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.960]   We're just jumping on calls all the time, and it's like a simulacrum of business.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.240]   We're not actually doing something or producing something."
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.720]   So your mind might say, "This work, I'm not going to do it.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.800]   This isn't going to lead us anywhere."
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   You know that.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.840]   You're just spinning your wheels in a highly performative way.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560]   Or your mind says, "Okay, maybe this will work.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.280]   I just don't like the plan.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.760]   What we're working on, what this job is, is grinding and boring or against my values.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.340]   I just don't want to do it."
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.440]   So it is your mind against whatever plan your productivity system is saying it should be
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.320]   doing.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.200]   So if we're going to fix that, there's two things we can do.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.960]   The first thing we want to do, of course, is focus on the craft portion, the craft bucket,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.800]   and your overall deep life buckets.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680]   That requires some work here.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   It requires some work to think through, "What am I working on and why?
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.720]   What are the projects I'm taking on?
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.480]   What is my workload?
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.520]   Is there something in here I just really hate?
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   How do I re-engineer around that?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.480]   Is there something in here I think is really important?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.360]   All right, so how am I going to do that work?"
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   Let's start thinking that through.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   Let's not be so haphazard and just see if we're in the mood for it and what our mind
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   says.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000]   Let's take that a little bit out of the picture, like we talked about with Andy in the first
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   question.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.440]   Maybe we'll set up a location for this work and it's different than what we do that.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.040]   Maybe my workload is out of whack.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.800]   I need to take things off of my plate.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.040]   Maybe I need to more radically shift what I'm doing, but we want to get the craft bucket
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.120]   in order.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.880]   So you've got to know what you're working on, why you're working on, how you're working
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   on it.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.480]   You want all of those pieces to come together.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.400]   And that might take you about six weeks of really thinking and tinkering and trying to
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   optimize that part of your life.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.600]   The second key then, maybe a little bit more surprising, is looking at the other buckets
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.200]   of your life after that as well.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.640]   The other areas that make a deep life deep and start systematically getting your house
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.200]   in order in each of those other areas as well.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.060]   Constitution, your health, community, how you're serving or leading on behalf of others
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.200]   that are important to you.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.140]   Contemplation, how you're making ethical, philosophical, and theological concerns, something
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.040]   that you're engaged with and at the core about how you structure and live your life.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   You get these houses in order.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.080]   And even then, when you're in a hard part or a hard phase in work, you're much less
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.420]   likely to fall into, let's go on YouTube all day.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.240]   Let's go on TikTok all day.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.880]   That spiral of activity, the self-recrimination that comes out of the spiral of self-recrimination
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   that comes out of you falling deeper into activities that you know are ultimately shallow
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   and not useful to you or your vision on earth.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.320]   When you have the other buckets tuned up, even when work is hard, they're going to support
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.640]   you.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.560]   Even when, okay, I have this whatever, I'm in year four of med school, my residency,
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.920]   and I think this is important, but it's just so hard and it's exhausting.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.600]   They support you.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.320]   And you say, I want to lead other people.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   I want to be, I'm exercising, I'm outside, I have the celebration bucket, I have this
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.840]   hobby, I'm really into film.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.160]   I have these other things that are more meaningful and quality, and they're there to fill my
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160]   time.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.000]   And even if I have to take a break from work for a few days, what I'm going into is something
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   else that's important, something else that I think is useful.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.320]   So these are the two aspects of what's pushing to the spiral.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   One is that your relationship to work itself needs some work.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.200]   The craft bucket has to be overhauled.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   But the second piece is you don't have other options for when work is getting you down.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.320]   So it's, I'm being pushed towards, I need a break and I have nothing else quality to
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.000]   do with that break.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.600]   So I end up on TikTok looking at ASMR videos, which I think is what people do on TikTok.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.360]   So those are your two options.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.680]   So you got to get the whole deep life in order and it's not going to get rid of hard things.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   It's not going to make your job feel good every day.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.880]   It's not going to solve all your problems, but I think that's what's going to be your
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.120]   best bet for getting out of this cycle of self-doubt and self-recrimination.
