[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.920]   [intro]
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to lead a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.940]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.480]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today, we answer a listener question and the listener
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.280]   writes in and says, "Joshua, good evening.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.320]   I've been listening for a while, and I remember that during one episode, you briefly went
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.940]   into how you were scanning all of your books to PDF.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.680]   I was wondering, will you please elaborate some more on that for me?
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.140]   Did you have a high-end duplex scanner or software specially made for assembling the
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.360]   multiple scans of the pages of the books?
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.520]   Or did you brute force it for all of your books with simply a plate glass scanner?
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.200]   The process of separating the bindings, and most of all, scanning each individual page,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920]   seems very cumbersome with my run-of-the-mill HP scanner/printer combo.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.080]   I'm curious because one of my hobbies is playing chess, and I'm usually unable to
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.820]   resist the unspoken promise of rapid chess improvement if I buy just one more chess book.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.880]   My wife would like me to consolidate the plethora of chess knowledge on my bookshelves, but
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.240]   I'm loathe to throw away some of the books before I have yet had the chance to study
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.360]   them, even if I admit that it's likely I never will get to all of them.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   Keep up the good work."
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.720]   It's a good question, and I have personal experience and personal thoughts on this that
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080]   I think will be useful for you today.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.760]   First, a short sales pitch on reading.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.960]   I have met only a handful of wealthy people who were not readers, and even that handful
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.200]   of wealthy people who were not readers and yet had managed to become wealthy, my analysis
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.360]   is that is a deficiency, and they were successful in spite of that personal shortcoming and
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.640]   that personal deficiency, not because of it.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.240]   I have never met someone who proudly proclaims, "I'm just not a reader," who I've generally
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.960]   looked at and said, "Well, I just want to be just like them."
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.000]   Generally, the people who most loudly proclaim such statements frequently, their lives reflect
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.560]   the fact that they are not readers and that they don't have the opportunity to gain the
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.160]   benefit of the wisdom of the ages.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.880]   Now that's not universally true.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.040]   There have been people who have been successful that I've come in contact with or observed
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.280]   that aren't readers, but at least usually when they say, "I'm not a reader," they've
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.720]   often said so with a note of apology, recognizing that they probably would get better results
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   if they were a reader.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.200]   There is no more efficient mechanism for the acquisition of knowledge and information than
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   reading.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.640]   Listening doesn't do it.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.040]   Watching videos doesn't do it.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.480]   Sitting in classes doesn't do it.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.000]   Talking to people and gaining just from your own life experience doesn't do it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.580]   Now all of those things are important.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.580]   Audio is helpful.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.880]   Video is useful.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.200]   Videos are wonderful and your own personal experience is crucial, but reading should
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.840]   be the foundation of all of our educational platforms.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.400]   Unfortunately, in our modern age, too many of us have the thought that education is something
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.480]   that happens to us.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.960]   We go to school and we get our education instead of becoming learners intent and focused on
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.480]   constant self-education.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.720]   Reading is very efficient because you can change the pace of reading as appropriate
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.760]   to the content.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.600]   Some books need about 10 minutes.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.680]   Some books need 10 minutes per page or more.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.180]   It's only with the technology of reading that you can apply the appropriate pace and tempo
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.020]   to your studies.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.060]   Reading is a skill that has to be developed and learned, but I'm personally convinced
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.200]   that the very first of your investment dollars should be invested into books and your time
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   should be invested into books.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   They're one of the best investments.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:29.520]   Books are uniquely rich in content, especially the good books, the best books, the great
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040]   books.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.440]   Books are works of, are labors, labors of love usually by their author.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.520]   It takes so much time for an author to sit down and consider their thoughts and develop
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.880]   those thoughts and put them into a book that people don't generally do it casually.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.120]   Only a handful of books are written quickly and published immediately.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.240]   Rather, an author will generally labor and labor and labor for hundreds or thousands
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120]   of hours over their content.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.180]   And in preparation for their content, they will usually bring a lifetime of study or
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.920]   at least years of study, years of interest, many interviews, much thinking and organization
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   to their topic.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   They'll bring that and put it into a book.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.920]   And they'll usually draw on the work, the collected works of others throughout history
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.520]   who've done the same thing.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.680]   So when you read a good book, you're usually reading the output of dozens of great focused
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.880]   minds applied to a specific problem.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.560]   And so there's a good chance that you'll get a good result.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   Not all books are great, but you can spot the great ones quickly and spot the not great
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.240]   ones quickly and adjust your time appropriately.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.000]   So books are a wonderful investment, but they do come with a problem.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.960]   And that problem is how do you store them?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.520]   Now my listener's wife would like him to consolidate some of the books on his bookshelves.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   And my wife feels exactly the same way.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.920]   My wife is a reader, but she very much, unlike me, she very much would ascribe to the Marie
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.720]   Kondo theory of books that once you have read it, it's become a part of you and there's
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.880]   no reason to keep it around any longer.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.120]   I appreciate that, but that's not been my experience.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.000]   And in her opinion, books look like clutter.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And so she doesn't like to see clutter in the house.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.280]   She doesn't want to have a bunch of bookshelves in the house.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.880]   Well that's a little bit at odds with my own decorating intention where I would be happy
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.680]   to live in a house that was stacked with nothing but bookshelves.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   I do prefer them to be on the bookshelves.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.880]   I'm not quite like the Clive Cussler character, I think it was St. Julian Perlmutter, who
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   was an elderly eccentric man who lived in a house where there wasn't any surface left
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.800]   because every bookshelf was full and there was a stack on every floor.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.600]   I like my books to be neat, but I do like to have them around.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.000]   And that performs a challenge because it's challenging to figure out where do you store
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   them?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Where do you keep them?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   Books are best displayed on a bookshelf.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.080]   If they're going to actually be useful, they're best displayed on a bookshelf.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.640]   And I affirm that from personal experience.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.320]   I've tried other methods of sorting and maintaining books.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.600]   In the past when we moved from a larger house into a smaller apartment, one of the problems
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.540]   was what do I do with all my books?
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.600]   And so my plan at that point in time was I went from using bookshelves to using some
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.680]   of those sturdy industrial shelves that you can buy that are two feet by four feet in
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.400]   size and I put large plastic bins on those shelves and I put all my books in the bins.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.800]   I went through and I inventory the titles and authors of the books and I made an inventory
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.840]   list so I would know which bin to access when I needed a certain book.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.780]   And I thought that that would work well.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.860]   It did not work.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.860]   Books belong on bookshelves.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.260]   So I tell you that first and foremost.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.960]   But bookshelves require time, it's space and there's a financial cost to maintaining those
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   bookshelves.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.240]   You have to have them.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.480]   So either it's the visual space needed or the financial investment of renting a larger
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.880]   apartment, buying a larger house, etc.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   So it's been a constant question that I have wrestled with.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.240]   I like the idea of having a personal library and in the future I want to make sure that
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.400]   our house always has a large personal library.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.960]   To me that's important.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.840]   But recently in preparation for traveling I decided that this time I would go ahead
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   and try digitizing my books.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.880]   And I learned a lot for that.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.720]   By the way I should also address one of the questions that you might have about what about
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.240]   the use of a library.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   I personally like to use libraries.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   The places I like to go to, libraries, I enjoy being in libraries.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.920]   And I love libraries especially for the purpose of scanning a topic.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.680]   Generally since the time I was, as long as I can remember, if I go to the library I'll
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.560]   usually walk out with anywhere from 30 to 50 books or more.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.480]   I have always maintained a maximum borrowing on various library cards that I've ever had.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.080]   I don't read all of them but I absorb a decent amount of what I'm interested in those books.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.120]   And so there's no better tool than a good library for being able to scan a topic that
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.640]   you have interest in and gain a sense of that topic.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.960]   This would be referred to if you were studying how to read a book.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.000]   The classic text on how to be a better reader.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.820]   One of the terms that Mortimer Adler gave me, the author of that particular text, one
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.680]   of the terms that he gave was called syntopical reading.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.720]   And that's where you survey a particular subject.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   So if you're studying a particular issue, perhaps it's gardening in general or a specific
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.600]   type of gardening or perhaps you're studying a philosophical question.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.640]   One of the things that you need to do is you need to search out all of the literature that's
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.520]   been produced on that subject and then you need to scan it and read it syntopically so
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.360]   that you can understand what the key questions are.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.760]   And then you go back and you identify the key texts that you need to really study.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.780]   But I've always found that's easy to do with a library.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:09.240]   You can go to a library, you can pick a topic and you can just grab 30 books off the shelves,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.480]   take them home and browse through them over the course of a week or so.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   And you'll quickly understand the basic outlines of a particular topic.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   So that's what I like to use for libraries.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.200]   The challenge for me is books that I actually want to read or that I actually read, I usually
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.640]   want to interact with those books.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:31.960]   For me, interacting with the book through the use of marginalia, the underlining, the
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.580]   highlighting, the questions that I write, that's important to me because it helps me
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.280]   to interact with the author, it helps me to pay attention when I read and it helps me
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.540]   to note my own thoughts and questions.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.860]   So my own personal systems of marginalia are relatively simple.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.360]   But I just have a goal that I want to make the book actually mine.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.600]   So I highlight with liberality, I underline without feeling bad about it, I mark questions,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   I circle, I try to interact with the author, I write my own thoughts or questions as I'm
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.920]   reading so that I can see if the author's going to answer them as I continue on.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.040]   I have little symbols that I use for an action point.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.520]   So I'll put a little check mark if there's something that I need to do an action point.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.980]   I keep at the front of the book a list of to-do items, of things that I need to change
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.400]   or things that I want to do or things that I want to look at based upon what I read in
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   the book.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.800]   And so by the time I'm done reading a book, it's pretty well destroyed for the use of
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.400]   somebody else.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.960]   But I find that that helps me to get the most out of my book.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.040]   And then based upon my own system of marginalia, once I've read the book, I don't need to
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   read it again.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.400]   If I ever need to come back to that book, I can usually remember what's in it, I can
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.040]   remember what I read, and I can come back and I can quickly look at my highlights or
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.360]   my underlines or the major questions or my summary of it, and I can understand if the
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.680]   book was, well, I can understand what was there.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.880]   And so I never need to read a book twice.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.960]   But I want to keep that system of marginalia.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.440]   And that's been a challenge for me because in the past I've gone through various phases
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.200]   of decluttering.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.440]   About five years ago, I was decluttering books because it just seems like most of my life
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.680]   I wind up with these boxes of books.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.600]   And most of them I've read, a lot of them I haven't, and they just accumulate and accumulate
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   and accumulate.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.200]   And so I just decided, okay, that's it, I'm going to get rid of some.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.640]   But about five years ago, I got rid of, I think I would say probably 500, 800 books,
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.760]   something like that.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.800]   And I had sorted them carefully and I kept the most important ones, but I went ahead
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   and I was hardcore and I got rid of lots of them.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.760]   But then I would regret that because there was one idea and I remembered what the book
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.040]   was and I went looking for it, I got rid of it.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.760]   Because it wasn't a great book, but I had this one particular idea.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.640]   So this time in preparation for traveling, I decided to try scanning.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.880]   And I thought I would really, I would try it.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.400]   And I had listened to my friend Jake DeSilis' discussion on this topic on his podcast, The
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   Voluntary Life.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Now, Jake is an entrepreneur, he is an early retirement writer, and he and his wife have
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.720]   been living a location-independent lifestyle for the last few years.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.240]   But as a reader himself, he wrestled with this question.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.520]   And what he wound up doing was scanning all of his library so that he could carry it with
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   him in his computer and in his various digital devices.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.680]   After hearing his system, I decided to do the same thing.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.560]   And so I decided to go ahead and scan my books and keep them with me as scanned copies of
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   books.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.640]   Before I go to the exact system of what I did and what I recommend for you, I should
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   also touch on the question of digital books versus paper books.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.120]   The current, in today's world, we're grateful of course that there are huge numbers of digital
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.880]   books available.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.820]   And digital books are superior in terms of a native digital format, something that's
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:08.520]   published in an EPUB or a Kindle format, or some native e-book format that works with
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.240]   your e-book reader, whether that's a reader that you're using on your computer or on a
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   handheld device of some kind.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.680]   A native digital book is superior for your reading experience.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   The problem with relying exclusively or primarily on digital books that are in e-book formats
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.360]   is, at least for the type of non-fiction reading that I engage in, that limits you to new books.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.360]   Very few publishers are going back to a book that was published in 1981 that sold 10,000
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.920]   copies and saying, "Let's issue this in an e-book format."
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   So first of all, the major problem with digital books is you only get new books and books
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.600]   that are larger.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.480]   Whereas paper books, there are millions and millions of them out there.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.920]   And with paper books, you can actually usually get a better deal with the used book marketplaces,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.200]   whether that's on the large sites like Amazon or on the various other sites.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.320]   You can go and buy a book for the shipping cost.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.960]   It's a penny plus the shipping cost, most books, $3.49, $4, $8, et cetera.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.040]   I'll buy books all day long for $4 a piece just to look at them when they're related
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   to a topic.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.080]   But that means you accumulate a lot of paper books.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.760]   The other problem with digital books that I have is that they are generally going to
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   have some system of digital rights management associated with them.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:34.720]   And the digital rights management systems limit you to an exclusive platform for those
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.400]   books to work, and they limit your ownership of it.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.160]   Now I'm conflicted on this.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.220]   I'm not a DRM-free purist like some people are.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.000]   But just as a practical matter, I hate to be stuck in the DRM system.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.760]   A simple example, let's take on buying Kindle books.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.400]   Let's say that you go to Amazon and you buy Kindle books on Amazon.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.120]   Amazon has a wonderful system to connect you with those Kindle books.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.040]   And the Kindle book marketplace is huge.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.120]   You can get so many great books there.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.760]   But the problem is you can't integrate those Kindle books with the books that you buy for
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.360]   your Nook.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.200]   And the other problem is in order to maintain those Kindle books, you have to maintain the
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   same Amazon account.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.360]   I'm a little bit concerned about maintaining one in-place record of all of the books that
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.080]   I buy and that I read with one Amazon account over the period of years.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.520]   I think that you should swap out your Amazon accounts at least every couple of years.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.160]   You should set up a new one with a new name and a new identity and a new location so that
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.680]   those aren't all connected in one particular record.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:46.240]   And then also as technology changes, you want to keep those from one thing to another.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.880]   So that's hard to do with the DRM of Amazon.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   I also don't like the way that all the data is collected with digital book readings.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.120]   So Amazon, again, as an example, has fairly...
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.960]   You don't have the same privacy of reading a Kindle book as you do with reading a paper
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   book.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200]   Kindle knows exactly how far you've read.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   They know exactly how fast you've read.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.640]   They know what you're reading, exactly what you're reading, exactly what you're underlining.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.320]   If you're taking any notes in those, which is, of course, difficult to do.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.320]   But if you do take any notes in your digital book, know that in your Amazon system, which
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   means that some of your most personal thoughts and your most personal insights and the personal
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.480]   things that you're researching are now available and categorized in a database that is exposed
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.080]   to the exploits of somebody who may be looking to find that information out.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.800]   Now, of course, for the most part, that's not that big of a risk, but there's a decent
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.120]   chance that at some point in time, somebody might want to gain access to that.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.720]   Now, you can change some of those settings.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.200]   You can turn them from public to private.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.400]   You can turn off some of the data collection.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.680]   But digital books just don't give the same degree of privacy.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:03.340]   And I'd be pretty uncomfortable with any creation of all of the things that I read.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:10.960]   Because without context, the particular interests that I have of reading about to various people
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.440]   might or might not look like something that they should be concerned about.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440]   Context is important.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.040]   So, I don't care so much for digital books.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.840]   I don't love some of the modern DRM practices that are foisted upon us by all of the major,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.680]   well, most of the major book publishers.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.000]   I do have some solutions to that.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.840]   I still buy digital books, but I have some solutions to improve that.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.400]   So, first, let me talk about the paper books, and then let's talk about digital books at
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   the end.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.520]   So, here's what I have done, and what I have had.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.740]   It's the best system that I have come up with.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:55.480]   First of all, in order to scan the books, I have engaged in, I guess, for lack of a
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.960]   better term, it's called destructive scanning, which means that I physically destroy the
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.880]   book for the purpose of scanning it.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.020]   That means that I cut the spine off, and I separate the papers out so that I can run
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.160]   it through a scanner.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.200]   The way that I do that, I've done this a few different ways, is first, I've done some books
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   manually.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   If you just sit down with a book and you rip off, if it's a hard cover, you just rip off
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.320]   the hard cover, and you can separate the pages one by one.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.760]   You can pull off a dozen pages and slice off the ends.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   You can do it manually.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.940]   I've done that with a few dozen books.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.880]   You can do this to some degree with a standard office paper cutter, but in my experience,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.120]   I'd rather do with scissors than that standard office paper cutter.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.000]   But if you have anything more than, say, a couple dozen books that you intend to do this
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.340]   to at a time, you definitely don't want to do this manually.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.840]   What you want to do is you want to get a guillotine paper cutter, and you want to go towards one
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.480]   of the more commercial ones.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:57.740]   So, the one that I have used, that I borrowed from somebody, was a fairly, it wasn't a high-end
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:03.780]   commercial one, but it was just a common desk-type one that could do a couple hundred pages.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.380]   With most books, I could put in most books, most paperbacks, most hardback books, except
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.860]   for the very thickest of my textbooks, which I scanned all my textbooks as well.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:18.420]   Then you can just slide them in there, and you crank the little wheel down, and you press
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.660]   the guillotine lever, and you slice off the spine.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.500]   And that works really, really well.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.740]   I used to work in a print shop, and we had a big, giant one that could do 500 pages or
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.180]   1,000 pages at a time.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.060]   That's what you use when you, after you do a printing, then you come and you do the trimming,
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.620]   and that's the kind of thing you use for that.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.300]   Well, you can get a home version of that for your home.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.580]   If you don't have one of those, you've got to get that.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.500]   So plan on that in terms of your costs.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.980]   In my case, I was able to borrow one, so I don't still own it, but I can have access
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.260]   to it anytime I want to.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   So you have to cut up and destroy the books.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.820]   I believe there are services that will do that for you.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.260]   I believe you can ship the books off, and I would recommend that you consider it, because
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.620]   it's very time intensive.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.780]   If you can look at a service, and they charge you a modest price, a couple bucks a book,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.100]   something like that, it's probably worth it to go ahead and ship the books off and have
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.900]   somebody with commercial equipment do the destruction of the book and then scan it for
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   you.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.300]   What I chose to do was I chose to purchase a scanner that's called a ScanSnap ix500.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.100]   At the time that I was doing this research, and it was the basic standard out there for
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.000]   a high-end home scanner.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.140]   It's a duplex scanner, which means that you can put a stack of pages, you can put 100
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.140]   pages from the book on the scanner, and it'll feed it through automatically, pulling off
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   the bottom, and it'll automatically scan both sides of the book.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.340]   My version of the ix500 scans at about 30 pages a minute, so that can make pretty quick
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.320]   work of a book.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.660]   You do have to sit there and feed it, but it'll scan 30 pages a minute automatically,
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.540]   and it'll create a PDF for you.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.100]   If you've done a good job with your cutting of the book to eliminate binding, to eliminate
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.380]   adhesives, and to eliminate double pages, it's fairly trouble-free.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   You learn over time that you need to cut off more than you'd like to, because you want
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.580]   to make sure there's no binding or glue residue that's holding pages together, because that
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.620]   just messes up all the scans.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.620]   But it's fairly trouble-free, and so you can run it through with the scanner.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:24.380]   In hindsight, given the fact that if I didn't own or have access to the loan of a guillotine
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:31.460]   paper cutter, I might consider buying one of the more expensive scanners that is purpose-designed
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.980]   for scanning books.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:40.000]   So the ScanSnap is about $450, $500 for the scanner.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.340]   If you can increase your price of the scanner up to about $750, $800, you can get a scanner
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.260]   that sits on the paper, and as you flip the pages of a book, it'll automatically take
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.020]   a snapshot of the book and scan it.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.820]   For the reviews that I looked at, that does a pretty good job.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.420]   Now obviously, financially, that's a pretty tough nut to swallow.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.820]   When I was searching, I didn't find many on the used market.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.820]   I would imagine you could buy one of those, digitize your library, and sell it for a decent
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.500]   price, but I don't know those numbers.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.980]   And because that particular type of scanner is purpose-focused on books, it didn't have
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:25.700]   as much utility as I felt having the ScanSnap Duplex IX500 would be, because the IX500 is
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.820]   something that you can use and keep on hand constantly for digitizing your life.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:38.860]   It's so simple, it can take a stack of mixed paper, receipts, invoices, documents for your
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.060]   home, etc.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:46.620]   And so since you can scan just about anything that'll slide through the scanning bed, it
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.580]   has a much greater versatility.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.060]   And so you have to factor that in.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.940]   You're trying to buy these books cheap and avoid from buying them in the future because
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.300]   you're trying to create this archive, but still, if you've got to buy a scanner, you've
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.100]   got to factor that into your pricing.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.500]   Because I have so much versatility continuing from the ScanSnap, I feel good about that
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   decision.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.660]   I use it a lot, and I like the fact that I can continue to digitize things going forward
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:17.100]   because that will continually keep for me a lower footprint.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.340]   I'll need less physical space because I have more things digitally archived than physically
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.340]   archived.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.340]   So I really like that.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.140]   So you need to cut the books up, you need a good paper cutter that can do a couple hundred
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.300]   pages at once, and a scanner.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   Again, look for those, see if you can sell them out, sell them in the future.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.700]   What ScanSnap creates for you is a PDF.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.180]   And that PDF is a pretty good quality.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.660]   You can scan in black and white, which is really nice because it cleans up even some
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.480]   of the old yellowed pages in your older books.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.040]   Or you can scan in color if that's important to you.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.340]   And the scans are pretty high quality, which means that you could apply to the process
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:04.180]   an optical character recognition program, OCR, which would in a sense digitize the text
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.180]   on the page.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.580]   I don't bother with that because I haven't seen the need for it, and I don't need all
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.580]   those files.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.980]   I just keep the PDFs, but that could be an option for you.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.740]   The scanning software does a good job generally of correcting for a little bit of distortion
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   as well.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.540]   So you get very readable scans.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.100]   But now the question is how do you read it?
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.780]   The obvious solution is you can read on your computer.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.660]   You have this nice PDF.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.340]   And I always keep my scanner on a setting that doesn't reject blank pages.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.180]   The ScanSnap software allows you to automatically reject blank pages.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.800]   That's very useful if you're scanning a stack of documents and most of them are written
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.700]   on the front, but you want to capture a few notes on the back.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.980]   That's useful.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.700]   But for reading, I want to make sure that the book is laid out on screen exactly as
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.980]   it is in the actual physical book.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.700]   I find this works really well with using the built-in software on my Mac.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.300]   If I just take one of these PDFs and I open it up using the built-in preview software
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.160]   on my Mac, it displays it on screen with a nice full page side-by-side view.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.100]   And I like to read like that because it shows the book there, and if I'm willing to sit
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.620]   on a desk, then it makes it nice.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:18.200]   I can write in a notebook or I can read it fairly comfortably if I'm willing to be at
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.060]   my computer.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.340]   But of course, we like to read with other devices, other tablets and things as well.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:30.740]   So I use a Mac, and on my Mac I use a software program called Calibre.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.540]   And from my research, this seems to be the standard for managing a library.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.340]   Calibre is a very powerful program.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.460]   It's an open source program that's freely available.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.420]   The developers do a good job of continually updating it, but it's an open source program
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.940]   that's focused on one task, and that task is managing a library.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.660]   It's not particularly beautiful, but it is very effective.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.800]   And so if you want the ability to manage a library, then that works really well.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.780]   And what I like about it is in addition to all of my scanned books, I can fully integrate
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.400]   all of my digital books that I've previously bought, and I can also integrate all of my
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.980]   various papers and books and e-books and things that you collect around the web, all of the
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.620]   things that have been available for you.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:21.180]   And so right now I have about 1,300 books in my Calibre library, and they can be tagged,
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.700]   they can be organized according to authors, etc.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.940]   Calibre is really powerful for that purpose, and I really like it.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.060]   When we come back to digital books in just a moment, you'll see why this is so particularly
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.420]   valuable.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:40.220]   The other reason I like Calibre is Calibre allows me to navigate and manage a physical
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.780]   reading tablet device without having to go through the internet.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.500]   Now there are options that are limited on this.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.700]   For example, I had an older iPad that I wanted to use as my reader.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.300]   It's got a very nice screen, it would be nice to read on, but the problem is how do you
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.740]   get the files onto it?
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:03.740]   And I haven't been able to find a way of physically connecting my computer to that iPad and moving
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.020]   the files onto it without going through some kind of internet server, and I didn't want
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.420]   to go through an internet server.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:16.260]   So what I've chosen to do is I purchased a standalone Amazon Kindle and a standalone
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.940]   Amazon Fire tablet, one of the color tablets.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.220]   Now the Fire tablet is very cheap, Amazon is selling these very inexpensively, and I
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.660]   use that particular tablet for viewing PDFs.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.980]   Now of course the modern versions of the Kindle will view PDFs really beautifully, sorry,
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.900]   adequately, they'll view PDFs adequately, but they're not beautiful, and I don't find
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:46.460]   them particularly pleasurable to read on, but the Fire tablet that Amazon sells is effective,
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.020]   it's got a good color screen and you can use it to view PDFs.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:55.780]   What I like about the Fire tablet is it's easy for me to just plug the USB cable in
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:02.460]   and directly transfer PDF files from my computer over onto the Fire tablet, and I just use
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.860]   Adobe PDF Reader, Acrobat, or whatever is on the Fire to view them.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.220]   I don't use the tablet for anything else, it's a very insecure tablet, I'm sure it does
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.600]   all that other stuff, but I don't use it for anything else, and I don't ever connect it
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.640]   to the internet, I just use it for transferring the PDFs over from my computer to the tablet.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.380]   So I always keep a few hundred books on the tablet that I'm reading, and then as I read
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.820]   them, then I go ahead and I take them off the tablet and I keep all of my notes and
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.740]   data for those books on my actual computer.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.400]   And then I do the same thing with the Kindle.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.500]   So I have an Amazon Kindle, you can purchase a newer one or a used one, I don't care since
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:47.560]   I don't use the system, I deactivate the Wi-Fi, I deactivate the Wi-Fi and the cellular connections
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.060]   if it has it, and I just plug the cable in.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:58.380]   And so Calibre and the Kindle or Fire is beautiful, it's so easy to move books onto the device,
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.620]   off the device, you just plug in your USB cable, it works really, really well.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.500]   I haven't tested some of the other tablets that are out there, I don't know the Nook,
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.300]   etc., I don't know how effective those are, but a tablet that you can get for 30 or 40
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.580]   bucks for the Fire or for the Kindle that you can get, the new Kindles cost a little
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.900]   bit more, they're a little bit nicer, you can get an older one for 30 bucks, they work
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.140]   fine, those work really, really well.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:29.000]   So I use the Kindle for displaying all of the native e-books that I have, and I also
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.020]   use the Fire for displaying PDFs, and I just pick one of those, whichever one I want to
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.700]   read, then I use those.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.460]   I found that effective, so it allows me to carry the tablet device with the books because
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.220]   I don't have anything else on the devices other than just books, it allows me to stay
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.580]   focused and it displays the text that I'm seeking to read.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.820]   One of the wonderful things about Calibre is it does help you with the use of a few
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.620]   plugins, it does help you from time to time to be able to strip the DRM off of your purchases.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.300]   So here I need to refer you to the internet because anything that I tell you will be immediately
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.140]   changed in the next software publication.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:12.020]   I'll just tell you what you can do is you can get all of your books, all of your e-books
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.320]   out of the clutches of whoever you bought them from.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.580]   You may have to install some plugins, you may have to play with the system a little
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:26.300]   bit, but I really appreciate having all of my e-books stripped of their DRM.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.460]   E-books really are wonderful, especially some of the resources of older books.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.100]   And if you start to use Calibre, I think it really opens up some options for you because
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.420]   so many of the public domain books of the past are now available to you with Project
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.080]   Gutenberg and many other websites that are available.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.840]   You can load up a Kindle with all kinds of quality reading, and I intend to use this
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:53.140]   in the future with our children, with their education, etc.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.720]   You can create different categories with Calibre and you can keep all kinds of different books.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.260]   And so it's really, really wonderful.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.140]   I do love having access to the whole library right there, and I especially love it while
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   on the road.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.820]   I have all of my textbooks, everything right here, so as I'm working on projects I don't
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   have to carry...
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:19.140]   I mean, I had two shelves that are three foot, so I had, let's call it 72 inches of...
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.660]   No, more than that.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.100]   Call it six to eight feet of bookshelf space taken up exclusively by financial planning
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.100]   textbooks.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.420]   Well, those are all now in a file where I can easily access them.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.420]   That's really cool.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.580]   It's really useful because it keeps the content available to me without having to figure out
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.260]   where on earth do I put these eight feet of textbooks.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.260]   So I really like that.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.820]   So for me that has been worth it.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.420]   I would commend it to you.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.300]   That's the system I've come up with.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:55.260]   I don't claim it's the best, but it does help me, I think, to get many of the benefits of
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:01.100]   modern e-books and modern tablet technology with a few of the drawbacks.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.700]   I do really like reading on the Kindle device.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.500]   It is very effective.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.740]   I like the fact that it doesn't have a screen, so that's good for your head.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.900]   It doesn't strain your eyes.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.300]   It's nice to read outside.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:22.820]   And using the system the way that I use it, where that Kindle never connects to the internet,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.660]   allows me to maintain and keep back some of the privacy concerns about what I'm reading
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.760]   and how I'm reading it, how fast I'm reading it.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.180]   So I like that, and the Kindle's very pleasurable to read on.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.800]   Fire tablet, meh.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   It's okay.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:41.180]   I really wish I could get an iPad to work, but iPad doesn't talk well with Calibre, and
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.980]   I'm not willing to go through all of the hassle that other people have done so far.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.540]   So that's what I have done, and to my listeners' questions, I hope that that will help you.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.860]   I do warn you this.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.420]   Don't sit down and try to brute force your books with a plate glass scanner.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.900]   That is impossible.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.440]   You need, if you're going to do this, be prepared to either pay for it, to buy the equipment,
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.900]   or just pay somebody to do it.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.340]   You should look at prices.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.740]   It's a lot of work.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.540]   I've done it, but it's a huge amount of work.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.820]   Only do it if you can do something else productive while you are doing those books.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.300]   You should seriously consider just paying somebody.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.380]   This would be a good job for you to pay a young boy or girl to do for you.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.980]   There's no reason at all why they couldn't do this competently.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.340]   You should consider paying one of the services, but if you want to do it the way that I did,
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.420]   get yourself a paper cutter, a scanner, and caliber.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:42.900]   I hope that you will regain some shelf space while still having access to the knowledge
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.220]   that you need to become a better chess player.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.740]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.460]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.540]   Escape the ordinary with Fiji Airways Global Beat the Rush Sale.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   Immerse yourself in white sandy beaches or dive deep into coral reefs.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:06.620]   Fiji Airways has flights to Nadi starting at just $748 for light and just $798 for value.
