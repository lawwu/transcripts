[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.620]   Unfortunately, in our modern age, too many of us have the thought that education is something that happens to us.

[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   So you get very readable, readable scans.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.100]   But now the question is, how do you read it?
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.900]   Well, the obvious solution is you can read on your computer.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   You have this nice PDF and I always keep my scanner on a setting that doesn't reject blank pages.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.800]   The scan snap software allows you to automatically reject blank pages.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.400]   That would, that's very useful if you're scanning a stack of documents and most of them are written on the front, but you want to get up to a few notes on the back.

[00:29:40.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   I haven't tested some of the other tablets that are out there. I don't know the nook, etc. I don't know how effectively, how effective those are.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   Ttablet, it's a very nice tablet. It's very easy to use. It's a very good tablet, but it's also very, very slow. It's not as easy to use as a tablet, but it's a great tablet.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:38.860]   or for the Kindle that you can get. The new Kindles cost a little bit more. They're a little bit nicer. You can get an older one for 30 bucks. They work fine. Those work really, really well. So I use the Kindle for displaying all of the native e-books that I have. And I also use the Fire for displaying PDFs. And I just pick one of those, whichever one I want to read. Then I use those. I found that effective. So it allows me to carry the tablet device with the book.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:31:08.880]  , because I don't have anything else on the devices other than just books. It allows me to stay focused and it displays the text that I'm seeking to read. One of the wonderful things about Calibre is it does help you with the use of a few plugins. It does help you from time to time to be able to strip the DRM off of your purchases. So here I need to refer you to the internet because anything that I tell you will be immediately changed in the next software publication. I'll just tell you what you can do is you can do is you can do a little bit of a little bit of work.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:38.900]   You can get all of your books, all of your e-books out of the clutches of whoever you bought them from. You may have to install some plugins. You may have to play with the system a little bit, but I really appreciate having all of my e-books stripped of their DRM. E-books really are wonderful, especially some of the resources of older books.
