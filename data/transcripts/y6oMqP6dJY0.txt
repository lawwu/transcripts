[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   So this is something I designed, kind of like, you know, collaboration to show you, specifically you.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So in other words, this is an experiment. It could fail.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Okay, like any good experiment.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Exactly. All different, yes?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   You want to mix them?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Sure.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Shuffle them as much as you want. This is just one way to do it.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   No, I'm not good at shuffling.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Whatever you want.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'll just do this sort of like a kindergarten shuffle.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   There's probably a kindergartner out there that can really shuffle cards.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   As you're doing this, I want you to think of a card.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Please, but don't say it. Just think of it.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Okay.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So right now, as you're doing this, the location where that card is changes.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Because every time you cut, complete, shuffle, it's in a different location.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   We don't know where it is.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Let's do this.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Even if I know exactly where it is, you don't know where it is.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Correct.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Name the card.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Jack of hearts.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Again, you don't know where it is.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I'll do it super slow, and you say the word "stop" whenever it feels right to you.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It does not matter to me when.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Stop.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Okay, I was about to move more. Should I stop?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   No, you can move it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   The one card?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   One last move.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   That's good?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Yep.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Let me ask you a question. Do you want the card to be first or second?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   One or two? Your choice.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Second in the stack.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So not the first, second?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Correct.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And the card was?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Jack of hearts.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So not the first, second?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Correct.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Let's see.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That's the first.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Eight of diamonds.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And you want second?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   To be the jack of hearts.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That would be amazing.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I'm shocked.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm shocked, too.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'm shocked, too.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Because I "shuffled" the deck.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You did shuffle.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So when you think of a card, let's give them a little mix.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   When you think of a card, okay, don't say it.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Say the word "stop" any time you want.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Stop.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This one or this one or this one or this one or this one.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Whichever you want.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   This one.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Even though you stopped on this.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Sure.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Place your finger right on top.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Tight, tight.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Okay.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   How crazy would it be if this is the card you're thinking of, merely thinking of?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   What's the card you're thinking of?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Ace of diamonds.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's a common card.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   If you want, you can change it to a different card or stick to this one.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Ace of diamonds.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Ace of diamonds.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's great.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it could be any.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And you also, you had the card the whole time right here with your finger on top of it the whole time.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Right.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   What?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's not the ace of diamonds.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's not?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   No.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Oh, goodness, my friend.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It's still not.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So, here's something I didn't teach.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I didn't tell you this.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The queen of hearts, she's considered a psychic card.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   She knew you're going to say the ace of diamonds.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So, in her pocket, she took it out and she's holding it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Take a look.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   She's holding the ace of diamonds.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I mean, can I expect --
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yes.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Is this true of any other card in the world?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yes.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   A lot of people don't know this, but most queens, they hold flowers.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Let me show you.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Here, flowers, flowers, and flowers.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   This is sort of, but not quite.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Wow.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Let's do something with your phone.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Open your phone.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Open your phone.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Let's do something with your phone.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Open to your calculator.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Zero it out.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I don't want to see what you type.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I'm going to turn around.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Punch in four digits, but make it random.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Don't overthink it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Four digits.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Do plus.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And now I want you to put a four-digit number that's meaningful to you.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It could be a code.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It could be an address.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It could be anything, a date, a year, anything you like.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And then equal.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Okay.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So, right now, it's a combination of a number that's meaningful with a number that means absolutely nothing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Correct.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Can we see it?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Do the equal sign.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You did it at the end, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Okay.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's the combination of both?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Perfect.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Can I see?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yep.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So, that number means nothing to you.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's 12915.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I don't know if it's meaningful or not.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's a meaningful number plus a, you know.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And you did zero out between.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I did.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Take these.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Give them a bit of a mix, as much as you want.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Okay.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   People can make fun of my shuffling again.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I want you to think why the number is important to you, but don't say it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Why that particular number is important?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Just think, yeah.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Okay.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yep.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's not a code, right?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's not quite a code, is it?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It is a code.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It is a code.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But it also means like a date or something like that?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Part of it?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   No.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Really?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   It's an important code.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's an important code.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's an important code.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Hmm.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So, let's do this.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   As I go through these, okay?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I want you to pull one or two or three or four cards.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   In one group.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   One group.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Go ahead.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   As a group.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   As a group.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   As a group.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Okay.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   One or two or three or four cards.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   In one group.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   One group.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Go ahead.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   As a group.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Four.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   How many do you have?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   There we go.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's four, right?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Take four?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Okay.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   No, no.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Put them further.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And these are the cards.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Four or five?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   How many?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Let's see.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It should be four.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Yeah, four.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Perfect.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And you plucked them from somewhere in here.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Could have been anywhere from here.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Right.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The number that's important to you, what's the first digit?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Seven.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And then?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Six.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Seven.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   No way.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   There's only one person on this planet that knows this number.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   No, everybody does.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Unfortunately.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Nine.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Goodness gracious.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   That makes no sense.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I mean, it makes sense that you would get it right because you're you.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's amazing.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   This combination harkens back to something that I learned when I was like six years old
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and was passed to me by somebody that would never, ever reveal that.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Yeah, amazing.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Wow.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That's crazy.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That's crazy.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Open your camera.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Okay.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Take a very bizarre photo.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Okay.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   If you don't mind.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Of you just holding my wallet.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So, usually I have my ID for this show.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I took everything out.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Sure.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That's a nice wallet.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Right there and right there.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Nothing there, right?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Take a look.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Nope.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Okay.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Nothing.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Good for you?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Okay, let's do this.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Just look at me.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   There's a bit of a...
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well, you got it.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Okay.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I took one photo.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Can you please close that first?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Lock it in and then close it again.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You know, we already spoke about it.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The idea that I can make you choose certain things or act according to what I want you to do, right?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So, if I ask you to name any playing card, seriously, any playing card, what would you name?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Doesn't matter which one.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Three of diamonds.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Are you sure or do you want to change?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Three of diamonds.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Okay.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So, it could be really any one of these.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I'm telling you this.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I'm going to try to kind of force you.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Don't let me.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So, you know what's happening.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So, just take any one you like, any one that you like, but halfway out, halfway out.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Okay, halfway out.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Okay, if you think I made you take that, push to take a different one.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I don't, but for sake of...
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You're okay.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I like that.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I like that.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Sure, sure.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Take a different one then.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   It's okay to move that?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Let's go with this one.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So, you said three of diamonds.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Correct.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   If that's the three of diamonds, would that be impressive?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   That would just be wild.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Can I ask you an honest question?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   How impressive would it be, considering you've seen me do stuff before?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Be honest, between one and ten.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It would be a seven, because I want to leave room for no.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I'm going for much, much better.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   What if I do this, and the three of diamonds shoots out and lands right here?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   That would be wild.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's a ten.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   No.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   What if it lands under my wallet?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That would be spectacular.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   What about inside the wallet?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   That would be, what's the technical term, effing spectacular.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   This has been here the whole time.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Can you open it yourself?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Can you undo this?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   No, no, right there.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Okay.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Open.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   No way.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   What the?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   There you go.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Goodness gracious.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Let's do this again.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Can you close it again?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Just lock it all the way in, lock it in, and put this in your pocket, or anywhere.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   We'll do this again.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   The only criteria is that you do choose a different card, okay?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Okay.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I'll just do this, and you say the word "stop" whenever it feels right.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Stop.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Take the card.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And just--
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Whichever, doesn't matter.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Yep.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Not the three of diamonds, I hope?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Nope.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Okay.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Push it anywhere in the middle.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   The wallet is there?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   The wallet is here.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Name the card.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Three of hearts.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   In the wallet.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   No, no, not this wallet.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Remember we took a photo of you holding the wallet at the beginning, empty?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   It traveled to the wallet in the photo.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Three of hearts, you said?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Take a look at the last photo.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Zoom on it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's the three of hearts.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Wow.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Goodness gracious.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Wow, wow, wow.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Wait, and if I go to the photo right before it, it's actually a video of Cal Newport, a previous guest.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So just to prove that it's not like multiple photos, not that that would explain anything.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And then our cameraman, Martin, got a cameo there, too.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Mind blown.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   What the--
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Sorry.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   That was great.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   For once, I'm speechless.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Good.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Amazing.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   That's amazing.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Thanks for--I don't really know what to say.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   There's a neural circuit going--and there's another circle--neural circuit, excuse me, that's involved in awe, which is just going--good.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And you don't want to know how, right?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You know, in this case, not only do I not want to know how, it places the brain into a place of there's no way how, but it just happened.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's a good place to be.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yeah, it is a good place to be.
