[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   In the last Ask Pastor John episode, in episode 218, you said you believe the pressures of
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.280]   pastoral life, the need to prepare sermons and devotions and talks and lessons and homilies
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.520]   for all kinds of occasions, that these pressures were God's means of giving you more insight
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.720]   into scripture for the sake of your people, probably giving you more insights from God
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.400]   than you might have had if you had been given more leisurely time for study in the academic
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.520]   life.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.000]   Is this just based on your experience, or are there passages from the Bible that help
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.280]   explain this dynamic?
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   Right.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.140]   What I said was a real fear.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.480]   When I left Bethel after teaching for six years, and God seemed to be driving me into
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   the pastoral ministry where I knew there'd be a lot more pressured preparation than leisure
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   for study, what I said was I didn't find it to be the case.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.640]   I found that God seems to love his people in such a way that when a pastor is pressured
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.560]   to have to get a message ready for them, he makes up for any deficiency in time by just
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   opening him in ways that he wouldn't open him to the text in any other way.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.320]   And yes, there have been texts that have really made a difference in my thinking about that,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.840]   and I'll mention just a few here.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.960]   For example, I love the text where Jesus says to Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   me?"
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.360]   And Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.700]   You know I love you."
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.200]   And Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.280]   I can't tell you how often, Tony, I have read that with a personal word from the Lord.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.920]   Like the Lord is saying to John Piper, "Feed my sheep."
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.800]   And it never felt like a burden to me.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.280]   It always felt like, "If you command this, Lord, you'll surely bless my effort to find
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   the food, right?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   Won't you?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.680]   You just said, 'Feed my sheep.'
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.600]   Would you leave me over this text without insight for the feeding of the sheep that
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.720]   you just told me to feed?"
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   So that text has just made a huge impact.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.680]   I felt in all my preparations, God was smiling.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.800]   He was saying, "Good.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.200]   You're preparing to obey tomorrow or Sunday.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   You're preparing to obey me, so go at it.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.680]   I'll help you."
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   And here's another one.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.480]   Luke 12, 42 is a picture of the second coming.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.800]   It goes like this.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.520]   "And the Lord said, 'Who then is the faithful and wise manager or steward, whom his master
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.440]   will set over his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.360]   Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.'"
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   And that text has always comforted me when I thought about the urgency of so many causes
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   in the world that I could be spending time on when I'm studying to get ready for a message.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   I always wondered, "Am I doing the right thing here?
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.440]   Should I be involved more with the poor, more with missions, more with the homeless, more
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   with pro-life efforts, more with American Indian ministries right down the street in
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.760]   my own city, more with the Somalis across the highway, more with the business community,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.360]   more with students, more with the elderly?"
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.120]   I mean, pastors, we deal with so many possibilities of ministry that if we're wired a certain
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   way, like me, we're always wondering, "Have I got this?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.800]   Have I got my priorities figured out right here?"
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.120]   And this text steadied my hand so many times.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.840]   It said to me this, "If Jesus comes back today, he would find me at my steward post, at my
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.960]   manager post, having listened to the command, 'Give them their portion of food at the proper
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   time.'"
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.520]   That was my job, and I was the household steward at Bethlehem.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.200]   God expected his household to be fed.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   And it seemed to me that if I did that well, if I was obedient in obeying that command,
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.320]   God would see to it that these well-nourished household members would pursue all those causes,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.640]   many of which I wasn't doing nearly as much as I could be.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.840]   So that text in Luke 12 has been huge for me.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.160]   And another one is Matthew 10, 19, where Jesus says, "When they deliver you over to courts,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.320]   don't be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.160]   be given you in that hour."
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:00.720]   Now, I know that that's a text designed for Christians under great duress, but the application
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.560]   seemed to me to be this.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.640]   If God promises to give us what we need in a crisis moment when we have no means of preparing,
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.500]   would he not do the same in the steady-state, daily, weekly feeding of his flock?
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.240]   Is God saying here, "I'm only interested in the moment of urgency"?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   Or is he saying, "I love my flock.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.680]   I love when truth is spoken to people outside the church and people in the church.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.060]   And so where you are set to obey, to speak what I want spoken, I'll give you what you
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.160]   need, even if it's three days before the talk happens."
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   And oh, goodness, there's so many more.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.280]   Let me just mention maybe one more.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.960]   The feeding of the 5,000.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.720]   I have felt like this little boy so many times.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.600]   I mean, Jesus says to the disciples, "You give them something to eat."
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   All right?
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.360]   So he's saying to John Piper, "You give them something to eat."
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.280]   Lord, there's going to be 5,000 people there or five people there?
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.440]   And sometimes those messages with five are just as hard as the ones with 5,000.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.820]   You give them something to eat.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.480]   And I say back to him, "I feel like a little boy who's got a sack lunch.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.400]   And you're telling me to feed this people with my sack lunch?"
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.500]   And the boy gave it to him, and he fed them.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.280]   He fed them.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.640]   And so it has seemed to me that whenever Jesus says to a pastor, "You give them something
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.240]   to eat," he won't let us down.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.720]   He will come through and take our little five loaves and two fish of ability and weakness
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.520]   and turn it into a feast for our people.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   So my answer to the question, Tony, is yes.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:00.160]   The Bible has had a lot to say to me as I've thought about the pressured life of the pastor
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.240]   trying to come up with food for his people without all the leisure that he'd like to
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.960]   have to think through.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   God is just totally committed to help us in this.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   Yes, he is.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.
