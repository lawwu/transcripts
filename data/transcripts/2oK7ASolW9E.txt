[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   what's going on y'all there's another episode of curious mike i am here with denise garcia and
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.040]   britney renner appreciate y'all getting on the show thanks for having us yeah it's an honor
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.440]   denise's first podcast ever we've um me and you have been friends for years now um first time
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.820]   meeting you the other night yeah y'all have been friends how long since like 2018 too but we
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380]   recently just got closer and then we filmed basketball wives so that i feel like trauma
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.220]   bonded us yeah talk a little bit about uh basketball wives what is that and like what are y'all why'd
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.860]   y'all get on the show and kind of what are you trying to get across on the show you can go first
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.600]   well i think the first time that i went on basketball wives i was very like friendly kind of trying to be
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.320]   liked and i came back full hijab and just different side of eyes and i thought maybe i would have a
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.580]   different experience but it was the same bullshit really so you regret going on there so what oh i
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.700]   don't have any regrets no i mean i feel like i don't think there's anything to be proud about when it
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.460]   comes to like checking someone that could be your mother like the same age as your mom but
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.840]   old bitches get checked every day and it's not something to be proud of but you know check out the
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.680]   show i've never seen it nah yeah i'm missing anything y'all too that's probably entertaining
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.560]   well i mean i enjoyed it i just feel like watching it play back was totally different than i thought it
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.820]   was going to be like i feel like people didn't get to see the real me they didn't really get to see
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.440]   like my personality really is it like it's reality tv right yeah clipping up and painting the narratives
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.560]   they want to paint yeah yeah but i think this season was so unique because you had a mother and
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.840]   daughter relationship that was just like the center and really the theme of the season and so like that
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.320]   in itself watching that playback too was really rough um we were closer to the daughter chantelle it was her
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.320]   first season as well so i i feel like that just kind of took up the whole season so it really didn't get
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.120]   what we kind of wanted really yeah i don't feel like at the end of the day it's really to showcase
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.640]   the lifestyle of people like in that world in that realm i feel like it's just more centered around the
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.840]   group dynamic and its dysfunction so naturally i don't think they even captured our friendship
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.240]   accurately in my opinion so you know but we made real friends yeah y'all are great friends obviously
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.000]   man there's um there's such a like for some reason such a negative connotation of being like a baby
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   mama like whether the relationship you were in was super like healthy and good and you had a kid
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.520]   and you brought a kid into the world and it was whatever for some reason people always take that
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.160]   and run with it yeah and a narrative is painted that's so negative sometimes so how do you guys feel
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.000]   about that and why do you think that is i mean i i i've felt for you just seeing like some of the stuff
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.520]   you've gone through comments wise and i haven't known you as long but i'm sure it's similar like
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.640]   why what do you think that negative connotation comes from and speak on that a little bit i feel
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.960]   like ever since um my ex and i were together and he posted me it was like oh you're a gold digger and
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.200]   this is before we even brought zoe into the world so i feel like people just think that you're kind of out
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.440]   there for what players can offer you like financially and just all of that um but i my situation i feel
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.680]   like it's like point maybe like one zero percent of the league like i knew him before in high school
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.320]   like my situation is very different so like having to deal with that publicly was really hard um i don't
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   understand why um fully like we get that in your situation like when you talk about athletes or people
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.800]   that end up having money it's their dream scenario to you know stay with the girl that they went through
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.920]   high school with and grew up with and that was you're in a zoe situation and you know so i don't
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.200]   know i don't really understand and i was an athlete myself too like i had my own stuff going on i was
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.120]   a soccer player he was basketball so it was like i had my own ride somewhere to go play and he had his
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.080]   own so i felt like that kind of brought us together because we both were student athletes but we didn't
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.000]   think anything like i didn't think that you know i didn't know what to expect so i was kind of just
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   experiencing it first and we were so young too like looking back i'm like i don't know how i even
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.400]   was able to navigate that but i learned a lot i feel like you you have handled it well like it hasn't
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.040]   taken away like since i've known you hasn't taken away like your joy of life you still like to have fun
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.400]   you're still denise it hasn't like beat you up too much so thank you in this world like it's good to have
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.240]   thick skin your situation's a little different because you met pj like later on correct how long
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.800]   have you known him what was that like yeah i met him um i think we had started kind of like talking in
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:03.240]   2019 um so kind of like right before he had got drafted you know but let's reverse one second because
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:11.160]   before we go on to that because that is whatever you have made comments i think you're asking us about
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.480]   how do we feel being on the other side of it my question to you is you have made comments saying
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.160]   that you would never wife someone who has a child with someone in the league so my question to you
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.000]   is like what inspired you to feel that way and what connotation do you have about women who have a
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.520]   child with a basketball player that's a good question we'd love to hear the answer what is my
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.480]   connotation i don't have a negative connotation to it i think that you know my my right hand man
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   nicodemus he um you've met little nick i think or you know about little nicodemus the little baby
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.440]   i'm always with and him and his wife just separated and nicodemus has spoken just on the the difficulties
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.520]   it brings once you have a child to then like move on like it takes a very understanding person to want
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:01.400]   to take on that role take on that and it can get really messy like when you're going into life with a
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.880]   woman who has a child and now you're having to navigate like how close are you going to get with
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.240]   the child how does the baby daddy feel about you getting close to the child so i don't have a
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.920]   negative connotation i feel like for me because i don't have any kids it's something that i've always
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.480]   thought i would stay like steer away from but i truly feel like as i've gotten older i've realized like
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.200]   once you meet someone and you're really down for them then you everything that comes along with them
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.720]   you can decide if you want to take that on or not i don't have a negative connotation like oh
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.240]   that person has a child so they're they're untouchable and that's like a negative thing i just feel like
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.400]   you have to weigh it out you have to because it does you know it comes with a lot if you're willing
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.240]   to take that on so i don't view it negatively the comments i said about um what comments are you
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.320]   specifically talking about i think i think you're talking about when he said that he wouldn't like
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.600]   somebody that was already oh that had talked to an athlete yeah um i feel like if you dated like
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.480]   publicly like a player it would be hard just because of i don't know i just feel like it'd be hard what
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.960]   do y'all think about that do you think that i'm curious on y'all's thoughts because to me i like i said in
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.680]   the in the comments like it would be tough dating someone's old girl and they just always have that
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.000]   like over you like i don't know it's tough like i feel like i could be tripping though it could be like
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.360]   an ego thing or like a insecurity thing i don't know it could be i don't know i'm not saying i'm
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.440]   right that's just how i've always felt but i'm i'm i'm open to change i'm not stuck in my ways i feel like
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.480]   i see why guys are hesitant with certain girls because i even see certain girls and i'm like you
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.960]   make it hard for us women to be taken seriously as like you know mothers versus baby mama or out here
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.560]   for the wrong thing so i get that because i see it and i'm like you guys are surrounded by it
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.840]   a lot um i just think it's up to to you guys to kind of like bet those girls out you know what i'm
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   saying because it is i see what you guys are surrounded by too so i understand that part of
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.800]   it but um on the flip side i just feel like the reason why i have stayed true to myself is because
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.040]   you got to make your private life happy and make sure that whoever's coming into yours in your child's
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.560]   world is adding something i agree so so is your is your because i've i agree with you your stands
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.160]   britney because i've listened to some of your like podcasts and you know talking to guys and whatever
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   and going back and forth with them like what is your stance on like past past are you like once
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.560]   you meet the person past doesn't really matter what is your what is your thoughts on that i feel
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.000]   like everything someone has encountered up into present day needed to happen so whatever has taken
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.120]   place whatever puzzle pieces these relationships have given you i'm not going to judge anyone for it
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:54.520]   if i don't want someone to judge me for my past i cannot judge them and i feel like of course i am
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   always going to be very vocal about that that group of people that i feel like you know if you have had
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.160]   public relationships or you've just lived a very public life like myself i always found myself going
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.520]   to bat for and being that voice for that because you know for me it's like i live my life out loud
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.280]   like i mean pretty much everything i've done you can google and find it so i feel like you not wanting
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.240]   children like with someone who already has a kid because you don't have children is a very different
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.120]   energy than oh you dated this basketball player who took you seriously who you thought was your end
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.080]   game and like i wouldn't look at you as that like to me that's very egotistical again your preference
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:38.360]   you're allowed that but i also think it's kind of like okay like i feel like it's honestly it's
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.200]   it might be the way most men are wired versus how women are wired like i feel like most women and correct
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.520]   me if i'm wrong y'all don't care as much about past as men and i feel like that's because y'all
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.800]   have a gift of being more forgiving being more graceful being more this all these things and men
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.600]   seem to like dudes will get mad over some stuff that happened five years ago when you weren't even with
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.720]   them but i don't know what that is in men i feel like it's just a difference in like how we view a
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:13.160]   situation um i don't really know if it's necessarily like wrong but it could very well be an ego thing and
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.960]   that's not that's not the right way to go about relationships but at the end of the day i feel
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.720]   like whatever your preference is there's someone out there for everyone like yeah i i also feel
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.480]   like though that men collectively not only have like pretty low self-esteem for the most part or their their
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:41.160]   ego is astronomical i feel like men fixate a lot on someone's past because they feel that another man can
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:49.000]   permanently taint a woman you don't have that power you just don't so it's like again you don't think
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.600]   so you don't think a man cannot permanently taint me it's just like not you maybe you're very a strong
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.840]   independent woman but a lot of women are very they've had relationships that have completely changed
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.600]   their personalities the way they trust a man the way they the way they view men in general i feel like
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.440]   like you can be in a messed up relationship that can they can really mess you up mess right but i
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.080]   think where i'm focusing on because i think it's i get what you're saying you're saying that people can
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.280]   be jaded from whatever experiences they have but i feel like when it comes to past and a man focusing on
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.320]   what happened five years ago or what man you slept with or what guy you were with that is thinking when
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.720]   this man stuck his penis in her she no longer has value so that to me is where i challenge like that
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.760]   because it's like okay well who are y'all having sex with we're the whores but who are we all
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.040]   fucking you know what i mean so i think that's kind of where it's like you know yes we're aware of double
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.000]   standards we all love them when it benefits us but the truth of the matter is it's like if you meet
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.200]   somebody that makes sense whether they have a kid whether they've been with someone publicly that
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.640]   was in the league it's like why miss out on the love potential love of your life just because some
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   guy dated her and it didn't work out they were meant to have a kid they moved on it's just like
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.960]   like i said but that's the that's the mature that's probably the mature mindset no no 100 i i wish
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.360]   i wish i could i could think like that too it's like it's like why are we seen as like the baggage
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   you know like why do we when it's like a blessing mama there's a baby daddy and also right and also
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.240]   like i really thought and so did my ex we thought we were end game and then zoe came before that so
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.160]   honestly it showed me that actually you are not my end game yeah and so it's like i had to learn in a
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:43.480]   different i think it's the same the same ideology is the reason why men like some type of like
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.160]   purity in a woman but women don't really like that in men like the the the girls that a lot of dudes
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.400]   go for is like someone who hasn't done everything in the book and and like been around the world and
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.360]   seen everything there is to see and done everything like they like to bring like a new experience to a
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.440]   woman and i feel like women are the opposite they want a dude who has done his thing can show them
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.040]   you know put them on new things i feel like it's the same ideology i feel like men and women are
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.960]   wired different but putting myself in y'all's shoes the double standards would get irritating the fact
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   that we think that we can just have a crazy past and have a million bodies in our past a billion bodies
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:30.120]   a million generous but then we'll be tripping about if if a girl we like has however many bodies my
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.560]   question is does that matter at all to you guys does past this past matter like at all that's hard
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.800]   because i feel like there's a part of me that's like get it out of your system i don't care what
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:48.520]   happened before me as long as it's not happening when i'm with you and after but also like to some
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.160]   extent because who are you exchanging energy with right like how those are real soul ties that's
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   a real thing when you talk about baggage like i believe in that i believe that all these people
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.360]   that you've been with can you can bring that into the next you can also cut the cord as well absolutely
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.560]   so for me it's like so how accessible are you because then that changes things like are you really picky
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.920]   with who you're exchanging energy with that to me is important yeah yeah yeah i'm not i'm 33 years
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.320]   old i'm not having a conversation about like body count like in my mind that's not like something i'm
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   ever bringing up um i just don't care again like every every step that you have taken to arrive here
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:35.400]   it's written so for me to like get caught up on all these insignificant really details like i'm more
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.480]   concerned about do i like you as a person do i like who i am when i'm with you can i be more of myself
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   with this guy these are the three questions that mean the most to me so all that body count and
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.400]   you know all that other stuff before to me it's just like yes like it's very talked about in pods
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   but it's like where how are we moving this conversation forward in like a productive way
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.880]   because it's like okay i don't want to go who's been with a bunch of guys okay well i don't want a guy
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.240]   who's been with a bunch of great now where do we go from here you guys we want somebody pure okay but
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.680]   you're not you're asking for something that you're not like 100 like are you waiting or have you
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.960]   waited till you are married or no no that's what i'm saying so you're not really pure either you see
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.040]   what i'm saying i think it is a double standard like like dudes really have a double standard on
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.240]   that i'm not saying a double standard is right i think that i'm not saying it's right i just think
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.600]   it exists for some for whatever reason it is i don't know if that's going anywhere like like i said
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.080]   there's someone out there for anyone but i do think that that double standard exists and i i think
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.080]   talking about it and and getting the perspective from both sides like it does matter because putting
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.320]   ourselves in your shoes like we would we would we would be mad if there was a double standard dudes
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:59.000]   definitely definitely try to try to like i said have those double standards you have been in the public
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.720]   eye for a long time you've been on you know social media i'm not sure how you got the you know the
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.280]   notoriety you got i remember watching some videos back in the day of you being very outspoken about
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.160]   certain issues what were some of those things was it mostly advocating for women or was it
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.800]   like what back in the day were you speaking on mostly and have those views changed at all as you've
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.080]   gotten older or do you feel like you're still the same britney as you were well i think my heart has never
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.600]   changed so there's pieces of interviews videos that you'll find that it still reflects who i am and
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:39.160]   where i am today i think for me um a lot of girls coming up it was the ones who were more quiet everyone
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.080]   has their own way of teaching don't get me wrong but like i feel like there were a lot of things that
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.360]   were unspoken and if i only have value because you don't know my truth then i don't really have value
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.640]   so it's like for me i just found myself like what what is there to be ashamed of
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.960]   so when i'm openly talking about my body count on shannon sharp or whatever what is i'm gonna be
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.400]   ashamed for what you know what i mean so i just feel like for me people just need to be more comfortable
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.200]   with their truth whatever that looks like and again it only takes one person to see your value that's
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:16.760]   yourself every when you choose yourself everything in your outer world it catches up so it's like i will find a
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.400]   man that it also accepts me for me i only need one guy i don't need five i don't even five a thousand
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.760]   guys to wrap around the corner and wait for me like for what so i think for me it's just like dude i'm
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.440]   saying things that people either a have already done b are too afraid to talk about and see i just like
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.920]   and what's gonna come behind it because i don't do apology tours and
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.240]   it is what it is i accept what comes behind my decisions i feel like part of the reason i wanted
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.440]   you on here i didn't even know you get on your first podcast i feel like part of the reason though is
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:57.720]   the authenticity you've always had you know i feel like speaking on the subjects you speak on and being
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.880]   very outspoken and like that is rare especially as a woman but in both of your situations like the world
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.520]   in my situation too just if you're going to be public at all if you're a public figure at all
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.840]   the world does beat you up they love negativity and all these things and a lot of your guys's
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:19.080]   situation has come from men so has that has that not that you guys hate men or anything like that but has
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.280]   that has that like weighed on you at all like just you with the andrew tate podcast or i watched a little
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.880]   bit of your clips with the fresh and fit guy and you're just like do those things having those conversations
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:37.800]   ever just you get tired of dudes no did did you watch those clips we had a great conversation
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.280]   fresh and fit one yeah but i i we had a great conversation really so we spoke for two hours
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.920]   now the clip that went viral was me calling them a niggas that was like the first time just the fact
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.280]   that like when you're when you're saying your points or whatever it seemed like he was like
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.360]   making light of it or joking around and that's fine because at the end of the day i don't question
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.520]   any platforms i'm called to i'm going to teach and i'm going to share what wisdom was gifted to me
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:04.360]   and whether it's received or not is not really my concern so again i've sat down with andrew tate
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.480]   fresh and fit academics joe budden kevin samuels when he was alive i mean all these people who were
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.160]   supposed to tear me apart and it's really just about perspective sharing so it's like i i love talking to
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.600]   different people even a tyrant can be a teacher so i don't i definitely don't hate men i i think we
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.160]   love men like you know what i mean like we're hopeful romantics like yeah you know what i mean
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.320]   i think i think it did kind of harden me a little bit like to tap back into like my feminine was it
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:39.160]   took me a long time because i was like hold on i need to i have somebody to raise okay i have to be an
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.000]   example for my daughter and what kind of love she should see her mom receive right so i really had to
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.680]   like look in on myself work on those things and i was just like not i'm like i can't i don't have
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:56.200]   the emotional capacity right now i need to be at my best if i want the best partner for me and my daughter
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:02.680]   and i i mean it hasn't been public like have you dated anyone since she was born i she's never met
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:11.480]   anybody so i literally i'm so picky i'm literally like so picky with who i choose to date um i really
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.840]   have just been focused on mine and zoe's world to this point i feel like because i want again want to
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.240]   be like the best denise like i relied i lost myself so much in that just trying to be the best partner
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.760]   when it was like i need to look inwards and focus on who i am what makes me happy what's going to make
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.680]   zoe happy zoe wants all her friends to come from like over after school perfect like let's you know
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:41.240]   it's just our world so it's taking me some time i'm really protective i've yet to introduce a partner
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.880]   to zoe um i don't know i'm like my guy might be a unicorn i don't know what would be the qualifications
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.960]   like of a dude uh for either of you to like bring in those situations being a mother now you want to go
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:21:01.880]   first like do you want them taking on like a like a father role at some point for your child like what
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:09.560]   yeah what are the questions i feel like she just needs to see an example of healthy love just getting
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:16.760]   treated the way that you know a woman should be treated like a queen um and just kind of have that
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.680]   like i mean she has a dad you know so i'm not looking for somebody to come and be her dad but
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.480]   it's like be that figure where it's like she's comfortable enough to have conversations you can
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.520]   have talks with her and have like develop that relationship with her that any little girl needs
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.520]   so that's kind of where i'm at i love that i mean i feel the same way too where it's just kind of like
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:49.080]   um i think when you have a child as well it life gets very serious where maybe other instances where
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.040]   you were like horse playing and just kind of doing stuff for the plot it's like when you have a a little
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:00.440]   person running around and um you want to really make sure that again like you said they're treating
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:07.080]   you with the utmost respect and yeah even though again my son has his dad as well but like if we merge
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:15.160]   a household yeah that is inevitably going to be a role like my son would look for that so i think it's
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.600]   like yeah you want an upstanding guy you want somebody who is of character who's consistent
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   who's a man of his word who respects you who's truthful all these things you know so you know
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.680]   again i feel like you know sometimes when you have a child there is that negative stigma just about being
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.280]   a single mom but there are people who don't care i mean look at sierra and russell it's just it's
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.600]   she had a baby with future you know what i mean he's not was the best like i like i'm close with
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.320]   russell then he was in denver i was over at his house and the way like he views little future as
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   um like you know he he takes care of him like as he should it's fire now russell russell and there's
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.720]   yeah out there like that what do you guys think are some are some misconceptions about you guys as
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.000]   individuals that like the work because i feel like you bring out the parchment you haven't really been
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.960]   very outspoken i know you you've been very outspoken and you defend your views and all those things but
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:18.200]   what do you think individually are some misconceptions um people think that oh my god they think i'm so
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:26.040]   opposite of who i am like honestly like they think i'm just uh out here i was out here for the clout and
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:33.240]   whatever came with zo um they labeled me as a gold digger a whore slut like all just disgusting things
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:40.600]   they couldn't be more wrong about me actually yeah so yeah i've seen it all i've like i'm like my comments
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:49.880]   like and they still to this day seven years later yeah yeah that's tough yeah what about you i mean too
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:57.720]   many misconceptions to name to be honest like really like couldn't be more true or it couldn't yeah like
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.640]   like it's just the opposite of you or just when you see all the time and it kind of just rubs you
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.440]   i have mine that people just think about me but like what is it let's hear yours first my misconception
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:13.400]   about me yeah i don't know so like back when covet was happening right like i didn't i didn't take
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.040]   the vaccine like i just because i think you should be able to decide for yourself i've never really
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.400]   taken vaccines my parents homeschooled us and we weren't going to school we weren't doing all that so
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.120]   like as soon as you don't do something i feel like that the public is for you're just labeled
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.840]   as a certain type of person and you're just like it was it was everybody thinks because i didn't take
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   the vaccine all of a sudden i'm i'm trump this and trump all this crazy stuff i don't know how that all
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.400]   that gets grouped together but there's there's countless um just misconceptions that come along with
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.240]   the decisions i've made and it is tough to deal with but at the end of the day people's public opinion
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.280]   of you like they don't meet you in real life yeah they don't have a real yeah impact on your
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.680]   happiness unless you let them like there is times where i get off social media like i would rather
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.400]   just be my family my friends and not even see it because anybody could say this doesn't affect you
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.960]   this doesn't affect you but at the end of the day if you see too much stuff in effect we're all human
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.560]   yeah i mean so i do take my breaks from social media for that reason but at the end of the day like
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.080]   it is what it is that's what comes with it yeah i barely i feel like i really don't post i
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.880]   started really posting a little bit more after basketball wives because i needed to look inwards
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.720]   and make sure that my life was happy privately i'm like i can post a life that nobody really knows
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.160]   about and i take pride in that because it's like you guys are going to say talk to me anyway so i might
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.200]   do you think you're going to do that as well all right yeah you still didn't answer oh yeah um
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   i don't know you know i've joined instagram when i was 20 and i'm 33 now so i think that very early
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.880]   on i was labeled a villain and i feel that in this in this world you're either handed a hero jersey or a
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.960]   villain jersey and i would say even before i really started to just run amok and and be vocal i was already
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.760]   labeled as that so i think for me it's like yeah a lot of people have horrible things to say which is
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.840]   fine um your feelings are not facts right um and also nobody asks but thank you for sharing that
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.680]   somebody cares somewhere in the world but it's just like i don't know i think sometimes too like
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.240]   those negative like those misconceptions and just people being nasty i kind of like the benefit of it
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.640]   because if people think i'm like this terrible nasty horrible succubus harlot horror villain
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.000]   stay away from me like don't talk to me or like keep your distance if you see me like i don't really
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.960]   mind that but i don't know i just feel like there's just a lot of negative things i would say um more
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:50.040]   recently probably the stuff about just with being muslim and um their reasoning why they feel i um
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.880]   converted i think that stuff has just been maybe more of the the glaringly obvious stuff that has been
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.680]   thrown at me which is like okay yeah we're gonna get into that in a little bit i feel like um
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:07.880]   what's really weird though is like in your guys's situation the the your baby daddy probably approached
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:14.040]   you guys and they'll label you guys like you guys are like um trapping guys or any baby mama who's the
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.680]   baby mama of a wealthy person a rapper athlete whatever the woman is the one who gets shamed and
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:28.840]   gets degraded so i find that i find that kind of crazy um yeah for sure i mean i can tell you the day
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.200]   it's so funny too because the day that i met is that like he we went to the same school the same high
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:43.800]   school the day that i met him was after practice my senior year we went to um the school like hosted
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   this dinner at this um at this like it was called papachinos it's like this little restaurant in chino
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.600]   hills and basketball team was going to see a final soccer team was going to see a final final so it was
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.520]   just like a intimate like dinner on the patio for us and it was after practice and i told my coach i was
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.600]   like i don't want to like i don't want to go i'm tired i have homework like we have this game coming
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.280]   up don't want to go what's the point i can't even get cute like we're going straight after what's
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:17.000]   the point you know like we're not gonna and um i remember like that was the first time i had seen
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.560]   him but i had gone to school with him all these years i was just doing my own thing and sure enough
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:28.120]   like he approached like you know and he approached me and since then like we were after that night we were
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:35.240]   kind of inseparable and we had our own things going on so it's like nobody it lands some things just land
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:44.360]   on like people who aren't really clocking it like you guys you really think that i wanted i knew this
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.480]   guy in high school like yeah i never wanted our relationship to be based off the things that he can do
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.240]   for me because i was like that it's not our foundation of how we even liked each other you know
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.680]   what i mean so um i just feel like people just will always find something negative to say about it so
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.720]   um it sucks but it is what it is like i'm not gonna say hey look at me i'm a good person like hey no
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:15.480]   this is my love no like it is what it is yeah i feel like a lot of athletes that i've met um they're
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:23.960]   like coddled man children so we definitely are yeah it's like this this guy was good in middle school he
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:30.440]   had his whole future mapped out yeah everybody from the teachers to the professors to the coaches
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:39.000]   that's really to me what my experience there are some stereotypes that are just true yeah and i
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.200]   remember i i made a video back in 2018 saying you know athletes are really dumb because most of them
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:52.120]   are you know it's just like if there's substance it's just not what they lead with so for me it's
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:30:03.800]   okay okay okay well then but so for me i think it's like because of playing basketball like you guys
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:09.560]   throw a ball in a hoop you guys aren't carrying cancer just like we're on reality tv we're not doing
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.200]   anything to change the world this is like cotton candy for the soul but what it comes down to is like
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.640]   you guys are in a have an opportunity to change your whole family situation so you're already
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.040]   fucking king dingaling when you're fucking 13 years old like so then you grow up no real character no
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.120]   integrity your teacher was low-key wanted to you and you had this other who was sucking your
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:38.360]   dick and doing your homework and it's just like now you guys are expected to be like outstanding men no
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.800]   like you guys suck like it's you know what i mean so it's it's not it's not shocking it's not
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.320]   breaking news this is the tale as old as time but if that's the stereotype on athletes or whatever
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.640]   then why then doesn't that stereotype exist for the women that so many of them flock to the athletes
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.960]   because if all these girls you know if that's if all them know that athletes are dumb and they
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.680]   don't have any character and they know that the dudes are going to cheat on at all most of them you
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.760]   know what i'm saying like then the women who are going after these dudes there's got to be something
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.560]   wrong with them like bad intentions like what we go back to so the stereotype that some of these girls
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:20.040]   are like called the names that they're called do you think that there's any validity to that if
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.320]   the stereotype really is that athletes are dumb and we're not good dudes and we're going to cheat on
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.440]   the girls that we're with like so what does that say about the girls that are chasing them that's first
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:39.560]   of all fantastic point relationships are mirrors i also think too when you meet somebody and you see these
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:47.240]   glimpses of hope like okay maybe there is more to them maybe they are different maybe i'm different
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.560]   maybe he was doing all these things because it wasn't the right fit
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:59.000]   and then you come to find out that well the best prediction for future behavior is past behavior it's
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.040]   not that anybody can't change it's do they want to so i think that's where you ask yourself you know
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.840]   i think now it's like how am i vibrational match to this person but i think that's a very fair point
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.760]   it's like what what is each person mirroring the back because it's kind of like the perfect storm
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:23.560]   you're dumb she's smart put them together you know it's like you know it's just so yeah i think it's like
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:29.800]   you you do think that it'll be different and maybe that's where you can be a little naive and thinking
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.600]   well he won't cheat on me because i know that's what i thought i thought oh he has an old soul
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.160]   like oh maybe these other girls that because they just weren't me like we're i'm a better fit for him
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:45.480]   it's gonna be a better relationship and it's the same shit why do you think i think i saw a comment
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.240]   of you speaking on um the fact that the type of dude you go for i don't know if this was a true quote
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.720]   or not but the type of guy you would go for will probably cheat on you i feel like i don't know if
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.760]   that was a true quote oh i didn't say that really well i feel like that's a lot of modern monogamous
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:07.000]   so i don't believe okay well a lot of women's like type or the guy that they like they know that
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.560]   guy like they know that they're they're not going to go for the guy that's going to be amazing to them
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.680]   never cheat on them be obsessed with them whatever like they got a 10 of those guys right here at their
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.640]   doorstep but they're going to go for the dude who probably is going to end up doing them doing them
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:28.280]   crazy what do you think is the reasoning for that is that just a lack of do you feel like once a woman
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.000]   reaches a certain age she gets passed out and she really wants the the good guy or why do you think
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.560]   so many girls go for something they know is it the nurturing aspect of women or what is it please
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:49.000]   inform me um i think that sometimes like nice guys finish last like not for sure i'm trying to
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:58.280]   figure out why i'm like ew like i want flowers from him not him like i don't know i really don't know i
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.320]   feel like that it shows where your emotional capacity is at because are you really going to be happy with
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:09.960]   somebody who's cheating on you no i better not find out actually but um i think some women
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.720]   now are okay with that because of what they get out of it i don't understand that i'm very much like
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:22.920]   don't let me find out um but yeah i also i'm just like i don't really want the nice like
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:29.720]   it's like give me a challenge yeah i don't know no no at one time in my life that's what i thought
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:36.360]   yeah where i was like okay ew disgusting like don't this guy i'm just being nice to you thing like if he's
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.160]   yeah and this was like where i was at a couple years ago i feel like i was just kind of like i'm not into
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:48.600]   that um now i just feel like i just really protect my peace and like i said my guy's a unicorn so
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:56.280]   i don't know yeah i mean i feel for me that um there's a lot of people that they just have a lot
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.400]   of unhealed stuff going on and then so you're not going to attract what you want you're going to attract
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:07.720]   what you are so um i think the issue with that um speaking from experience because i mean i've made
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:15.240]   every mistake and i'm gonna probably make more tomorrow but um our self-esteem is in the dirt
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:22.520]   like you know i it's like we want that again whatever is familiar more again like your childhood
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:29.320]   like what if you're used to seeking validation or perfectionism or um i'm jumping through hoops
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   that was something for me it was like i have to perform to be loved right so the unavailable guy
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:43.000]   emotionally was intriguing to me but when you start to understand where these root like where these wounds
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.760]   are rooted in and you can heal it you're not attracted to mr bare minimum that texts you you know
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:55.320]   what i mean so i think it's um you have to pick your self-esteem out of the ground off the dirt put
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.680]   it put your crown on figure it out get to the root of what you have going on because i feel like for me
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:08.520]   i've dated regular guys in recent years and not so regular guys it's like i want the guy who's going
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.560]   to roll out the red carpet to the magic carpet i don't care if that's mr regular regular yeah or if it's
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.800]   mr i play basketball or football or like whatever it's but it's i think for me again when you
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.920]   continuously choose yourself your outer world has to reflect what's going on internally so i think
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:31.000]   people whether that's the guy who's talking to himself in his in your dms or the girl who's chasing
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.120]   the guy that doesn't really want her just you know um you got to kind of look at like
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:46.120]   how where are we a match and why and do i like this yeah i feel that my last relationship question
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.720]   like where do you feel like um it gets to the point in the relationship where it's just like if it gets
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.840]   to that point you it's no longer good like do you feel like if you're checking each other's phones you
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.560]   have each other's instagram passwords you have your location like you feel like it's it's time to call
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.240]   it quits or do you feel like because i'm sure you guys have been in situations where you've tried to
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   make it work not only for the sake of the relationship for the sake of the kids so like
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:15.400]   when does it get to a point where it's like this needs to be over with when you have to have somebody's
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.720]   location or you have to blow them up or i'm starting not to trust the relationship's over
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.680]   it's over like there's no point in doing that why do i need to go through i don't want to go through
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.840]   your instagram yeah like i should trust you yeah i feel like if if that's a thought then you already
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:38.920]   have your answer so it's just you know again like when it i feel like too when you start to get too
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.720]   attached in that way to the outcome i feel like you're already starting to lose the plot and the
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   point it's like you're you're so obsessed with this relationship working that you're missing all of these
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.040]   red flags that are on fire you know whether it's the phone whether it's just a lack of trust
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.400]   but i think it all still comes back to this person's mirroring something that you need to work
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:07.160]   on within yourself so starting there would be great yeah i have one last question why do you think men
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.520]   struggle with monogamy so much more than women like do you feel like men are simple because some dudes
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:17.960]   really and probably some guys you've been on podcasts with really believed it monogamy is not for men like
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.240]   men should be able to have multiple girls and it's not natural to lock in with one girl no matter how special
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.560]   she is because i feel like a lot of women get hurt because they feel like oh this guy cheated on me
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.520]   so he must not love me i'm not enough and then her self-esteem is is it terrible but like they don't
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.720]   know that you can love a girl fully like a hundred percent and still cheat on her and it's because you
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.520]   lack probably self-control you probably use probably what but it's not that you don't love her it's not
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.560]   that she's not enough so a lot of guys will take that and be like men just aren't supposed to be with one
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:55.400]   woman um do you guys agree with that or do you feel like it's a lack of self-control or why do you feel
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:00.840]   like even if you're the perfect girlfriend you could still get cheated on yeah what are your thoughts about that
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.880]   i think my question would be before we answer do you believe in monogamy
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:12.360]   monogamy um i do i think i do believe in it because i grew up with a mom and dad they're still married
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.560]   after 30 some years they had eight kids homeschooled all of us um so i grew up seeing that but a lot of
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.120]   my friends a lot of guys in the nba they don't they don't believe that's like natural for like a man and
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.560]   i see why like when you have all these options and you you have a wandering eye like it is hard
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.360]   now it's you get on your phone and it's right if your girl's annoying you making you mad you can just
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:41.560]   it's so easy i i personally feel like it's a lack of self-control probably and just um
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:47.880]   but if you really are seeking peace in your life and happiness i feel like one woman it will bring
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:54.760]   you that more than multiple to me yeah i think i like like they just have so many options and it's so
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:01.480]   easy and i feel like women too we kind of did ourselves some women did our like i mean as a collective
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:07.960]   did us a disgrace because here you are accepting and willingly being that side or whatever it is
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:14.040]   and making it so easy that you ruin it for everybody yeah especially nowadays because girls have gotten in
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.800]   that mentality of they're they're trying to be dogs yeah and they think it's like it's something to be
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:24.440]   proud of it's disgusting like oh i got this dude's i got this dude wants me disgusting yeah there was a
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:34.680]   point in time it uh the women before us they they had no rights it was to be seen not heard yeah this
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:40.840]   is the most freedom we as women have had collectively in just career invisibility and using our voices and
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:49.400]   being in prominent spaces so i feel like at one point in time uh the dad would go trade his daughter for
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:55.240]   three cows so it's like how far back are we going because we can compare monogamy to it's not natural
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.320]   because animals don't do it there are several animals especially birds and birds can fly anywhere
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.160]   there are monogamous so if the bird can fly anywhere in the world why would they leave with just one bird
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:13.080]   i didn't even know that was a fact ravens are monogamous eagles are monogamous vultures are monogamous
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.480]   that's why i'm like there's a lot of birds and just in general i love birds but um that are
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:25.720]   monogamous so my thing is is like i think it's more disgusting for a woman to be like that no i think
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:32.120]   at the end of the day that people are a vibrational match this is a game that we are in this is a feedback
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:38.840]   system okay well let me let me rephrase that if a man a man can completely love a woman and still
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:44.280]   i feel like i feel like i need a drink do you feel like that a man can completely love a woman and
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.960]   still cheat do you agree with that or no he doesn't love you fully you don't love yourself yeah period
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:55.720]   it's not about this woman isn't enough she's not popping pussy in a handstand you as a man there is
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:03.160]   something lacking within you because at the end of the day like the deeper the bond and the commitment
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.440]   everything is heightened in it from conversation to sex that everybody's so their panties in a
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:14.120]   bunch about like everything is better when you have like that best friend like we go to the movies and
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:20.040]   it's just amazing because this is my is my friend like the deeper the bond the the further you really
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.600]   go you know what i mean you're going being able to go to the bottom of the ocean floor is what life is
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.280]   all about what you're speaking facts so it's like that's why it's like one of the other it's just
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:37.080]   like what what reality do you want to experience whatever that answer is just be sure that you're
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:43.000]   okay with accepting whatever comes behind it if you want to go out and and a hundred guys in a week
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.880]   just be sure you can take on whatever repercussions come with that spiritually emotionally physically
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:53.960]   mentally just my biggest thing is not go 100 guys in a week and it's not wait until you're married
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.720]   it's whatever you do you just make sure you stand on that and you accept whatever comes behind it
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.520]   and be proud of what be proud of the things that you do that's really where i stand with that so i don't
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:11.000]   like compare one of the other it's what do people want to experience it's not even wrong it's what do you
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.040]   want to experience what do you want to experience in this life there's a buffet have whatever you want
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.720]   just accept if you get sick from the crab legs that's on you i agree with that so that leads me
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:29.560]   to my next question i want to transition to you obviously have um you're you're muslim now and i
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.200]   want to talk about the transition to that what led you to that point and what led you to be so dedicated
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:42.840]   in that space what were you before you were muslim spiritual just spiritual and i'm right back right
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:51.560]   there oh it's not that i'm not muslim it's that i was in a rebuilding purification process of my life
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.600]   and when you completely demolish a house you have to have some type of blueprint right you're not just
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.280]   going to just start putting up pillars and there has to be a map islam was the only thing that only
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.120]   religion i've ever been drawn to i don't like rules and my background is very spiritual so i go from
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:15.080]   pacific ocean to a religion puddle that's any religion this is not an attack on islam because
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:23.240]   it's all the religions are beautiful in their own way um you don't need religion let me say this hold on
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.400]   um i don't feel like i don't feel like talking about this like people expect it to be worded
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:39.240]   perfectly i know it but the thing is is that i have not talked about it since i took my hijab off
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   and there are plenty of born muslims who are not in hijab there are plenty of muslims billions there are
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.280]   two billion muslims in the world i'm sure there's hundreds of thousands that are not in hijab especially
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:58.360]   in the west um i think religion is a tool just like numerology and just like astrology it was a tool
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:05.080]   that i used to really build a solid foundation where i went from far left to far right and now i'm in a
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:14.920]   place of harmonization so i think for me um what inspired me was that my soul was very tired um you again
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:22.120]   i can see i see god when i'm when i see the sunset i see god when i look at the ocean i see god when i
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:28.040]   just am outside in the grass and it's like you don't need specifically religion to have a relationship
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.760]   with god but i think when you don't know where to turn and you don't have a foundation like i didn't
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   grow up religious i grew up raising my grandparents unruly making my own rules so i think for me i i went
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.520]   back to the basics learned about the foundation and was like okay i'm gonna eat the meat spit
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:52.760]   the bones and this is where i'm at for religions like islam or christianity that say like you know
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:59.000]   this is the way to god they're they're not they're pretty firm on like you know there's not multiple
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.120]   routes there's not multiple ways to god they all have their own truth and yeah that's the route i feel
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:10.600]   like islam is similar to christianity in that way so how do you how do you like put that together with
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.040]   like people that are just spiritual and they seek god in this way i see god in that way because i feel
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:22.520]   like in religion they will all say like this is the one way to god like in islam i don't know the
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:28.200]   specifics of the religion but aren't there all these like qualifications you have to do to reach god and
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.960]   and and the the yeah so what do you think about that because there are people out there that believe
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.160]   that you can just anybody can reach god in any different route and then there's people that
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.200]   believe that this is the one way um now that you've experienced kind of both sides of that you
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.760]   where do you stand with what just like seeking god like can is it through a religion you don't view
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:54.120]   it as through a religion anymore correct i think different people need different things and i do not
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:01.720]   judge how people learn because for me like i said i went from pacific ocean to a religious puddle i think
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:08.440]   spirituality is very broad and i think you understand when you are able to like the bigger picture is
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.800]   frameless right so it's kind of like why would i say unless i'm in a cult that there's only one way
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:22.360]   to something because us having to all think the same that is the beginning of a dictatorship that's the
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.280]   beginning of a cult that is a lot of things that to me that just don't align with where i'm at
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:35.480]   um so i believe personally after just experience i i mean i went full in like there are people who are
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:41.240]   born muslim who are still not in hijab today the second two days three days before i took my shahada
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:48.200]   i was in hijab before i even took my shahada so i just feel like there are different things that people
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.240]   need throughout their journey and i feel like even when i had the hijab on it was like an invisibility
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:48:00.040]   cloak like nobody could see me so that was a layer of protection that when i was rebuilding myself from
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:06.840]   the dirt that i needed so it's just like i think different people need different stuff and to say that
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:12.760]   one way is it i think is incredibly irresponsible and just foolish so it's like there are plenty
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.360]   of people who tell me all the time who write me that i'm see you in hell sister like well you'll be
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:24.440]   right there with me babe like you know so i just feel like you know um i think you can implement all
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.880]   things um just because i'm not in hijab i'm still muslim in my heart just as much as i love astrology
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.400]   just as much so i love numerology just as much as probably back in 1876 i was considered a witch and
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:42.040]   burned at the stake i'm all of those things i don't have to like get discount one part you know of
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:48.680]   myself because this is who i am i feel that for a lot of christians i've experienced and i see that if
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.400]   you're a christian and you're not practicing it perfectly in their eyes it's the people that are
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:59.000]   supposed to lift you up and pray for you that end up tearing you down yeah and your experience if you
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.600]   aren't practicing perfectly how they want to like you said you receive comments have you have you
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.320]   experienced that it's from those same people that should be like lifting you up that are tearing you
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:14.680]   down the most yes i feel like that's a big problem in christianity that leads people away from even
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.000]   wanting to mess with it because it's the christian people that are the most judgmental the most
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.800]   hypocritical the most um pointing the finger and it draws people away even though that's not god doing
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.720]   that that's that's flawed people doing that but is it this have you experienced the same thing well of
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:36.760]   course um i feel like some of the nastiest comments were from people who i go to their page and you're
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:45.640]   muslim i think you would have to really sit back and wonder if this religion is so effective and there's
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:53.080]   only one way to to i guess be right in the eyes of god then all these people who are practicing how are
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:59.240]   and how and why are they missing the mark is there something in the curriculum is it just the lack of
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.920]   comprehension like where where are we not aligning here because if it's such a beautiful religion well
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.560]   then we shouldn't breed beautiful people of beautiful understanding right so then now it's like okay well it's
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:20.360]   clear to me that irony is truly spectacular and um i don't need a religion to be a good person i don't
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   need any religion to smile at somebody on the street i don't need a religion to do good and be good
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:32.520]   you know i understand there is a creator that'd be foolish to think we're just running amok here just
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:40.840]   unsupervised you know but um i think it makes me wonder i question all religions if if the people
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:47.080]   in it are the most judgmental something isn't right in the water i think that too that's what i think a
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.960]   lot about about about about christianity a lot as well like if you if you are hearing from god if you have
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:58.200]   the holy spirit if you then then why is it not being shown in the way you live your life sometimes in the
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:03.480]   way you relate to people i think about that all the time and i also feel from even going to the mosques
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:12.200]   and i have seen and experienced myself any man who's like a kind of like a preacher who tried to have sex
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   with me so it's like the people who are in these positions who should be the most devout leaders in
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:29.640]   that community quite contradicting here i am months into my journey telling you no but you are leading
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:36.120]   the moths that's that's that's the toughest thing for me so it's the people that are supposed to be in
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:43.560]   the word the most be praying the most be the closest to god that fall and shorten or while and out on the
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.480]   side and then they get exposed for i i've there's been theologians who have been exposed and i always
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:55.800]   question like how if you're the most you know educated on the bible you're speaking to god the
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:01.560]   most you're leading the christian community how are you like it that is something that is tough for me
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:09.480]   as well but i want to add to that is that even in that experience my empathy for him deepens because
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:15.560]   i think sometimes people wear religion and i can even speak from my experience too i think it is something
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:25.880]   that when i joined islam i felt like it was purifying me i felt better and more it it is like
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:31.480]   sometimes people cloak themselves with religion to have the appearance of being good because when i'm in
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:36.680]   full hijab or i'm in a niqab people automatically assume they don't know what's under here they don't
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:42.440]   know what's going on they're assuming i'm good so i'm benefiting from what religion brings that like that
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:53.720]   stereotype um but with even the imam it's so extreme that there's no room for humanity like there's no
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.840]   room for him to be a human like if i was in a different place i would have easily like had sex
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.520]   with him you know what i mean like what do you mean duh i would have you in the next week but it
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.640]   just where i was at it just wasn't it just wasn't where it was at that time i'm purifying you know
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:14.520]   but i think that's what actually made me feel for him because you know he hadn't experienced life he
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:20.760]   was married for a long time had eight seven eight kids and was with one woman and then here you are like
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:29.480]   you're divorced now how do you date so my empathy deepened for him because i'm like you that's what you
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:37.640]   you want to try the buffet of life and you just are like but that's not you know i feel like that's
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.920]   an amazing place to get to when people either wrong you or they're just bad people in life instead of
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:48.120]   judging having empathy like that shows where you're at in your life and that's really remarkable to me
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:56.680]   um what about you where are you at in your walk with everything i mean i was baptized so i was i
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.840]   was raised like catholic like we my parents and family did we went to catholic church but as i gotten
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:11.560]   older um i found myself on the christian side of things like i'm a christian um but
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:19.720]   uh to piggyback off what you said too it's like i know in my heart and i feel like um where i'm at
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:26.840]   i'm i don't go to church like every week or i'm not doing the things that we're technically supposed
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:33.640]   to be doing like we all sin differently i feel like but like in my heart like i believe in god i try not
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:40.200]   to just like it's like my guideline that keeps me center to myself like i want a man who also
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.240]   believes in god and can when he's messing up or something's going on he looks at himself and is like
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.720]   how am i gonna make how how would god what would god tell me to do right now yeah like i want that
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:54.360]   to like set real him in yeah you know and it's like not like you have to go to church all that we
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:59.560]   have to do all these things but it's like it has to center your life yeah being known that there's
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:06.360]   someone over this whole thing like watching and and that's that's that's a good thing i also just
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:15.480]   think religion too it's a guideline it's not a law book so agree my last question for y'all is y'all are
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:23.400]   both obviously have your own things going on you know never needed a dude whatever talk about talk about
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:30.040]   a little bit about um the i i feel like you you have businesses going on correct and i don't know
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:34.280]   what you got going on but what's what y'all got going on like day to day like what's y'all's lives
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.760]   look like how are you how are you making a crack is it is it mostly social media for you i've heard you
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:45.320]   have some businesses as well i mean i'm i'm day to day i'm moment to moment social social media has
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:51.000]   changed a lot the way that i've made my money has changed um i think you know companies have smartened
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.440]   up too and and then it's also the over saturation of a girl will take free clothes over money who's
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:03.560]   still you know so uh yeah i'm i'm figuring it out really i don't yeah i mean i think it's like as an
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:08.360]   entrepreneur and being on social media for 13 years it's like it just changed a lot so you got to adjust
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:16.680]   with the times i think for me um my thing that i'm focused on is streaming in my own podcast so it's
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:22.920]   very very entertaining that's what you need to do because no one no one speaks with the conviction
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:29.640]   you do and has a personality you do you're one of a kind so you got to somehow express that in your own
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:38.920]   way for sure she is she is what about um so i feel like mom like i've been focused on mom mode and um
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:44.440]   now i want to get into starting my own business i have an idea that i'm working on right now and then i
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:49.400]   started my non-profit which is stronger than stroke so that's awesome yeah so that to me has been really
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:58.040]   fulfilling and um so yeah i'm excited for what's to come with that and to see where it goes um and then
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.920]   my own business kind of i kind of got inspired with basketball wives like there were some things that came
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:08.840]   up for me that i was like wow i can actually do this this is a lane for me um so just exploring that more
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:16.840]   more is like my focus yeah i have a question though what i'm curious about is what made you want to sit
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:25.400]   down and talk with us um well honestly because i've i've seen i've known her for a while i've seen how
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:31.080]   she gets criticized unfairly and then i know you were in a semi-o situation i know you guys are friends
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.960]   and i've always kept up with some of your videos from way back in the day i watched some of your podcasts
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.920]   that you've done and i've always respected the way that you think and the in the way that you're able
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:45.560]   to articulate your feelings that is very rare and the fact that you can go in any room and talk to
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:50.520]   anybody about any subject and you know what you're talking about so it was more it was more wanting to
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:57.560]   like not have a a debate but have a like have a conversation and and and understand like where you
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:03.480]   guys coming are coming from yeah in your situations and the way you view things because i feel like
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.320]   these type of conversations um are usually like this side versus this side instead of people trying to
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:15.960]   understand both sides and have have empathy like you said and i feel like that's what we're missing and
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.520]   that was the whole point of curious mike was not only to have people on here that you agree with or you
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:26.680]   whatever but have people on here that you can learn from and i feel like a lot of people can learn
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:34.760]   especially in my shoes like as an athlete as whatever um people think very differently than
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.240]   you guys sometimes i feel like there's a lot of understanding to be had so i just thought that was
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:44.440]   the reason and i appreciate you i appreciate that i feel like a big part of life too and just like figuring
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.200]   we're all trying to figure it out and it's like i want to understand why people think the way that
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:53.720]   they think and why they do what they do so yeah i feel really seen it was dope no i'm glad you guys
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.160]   pulled up so we gonna wrap it up man curious mike out
