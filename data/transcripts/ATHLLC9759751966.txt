[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.800]   Hello, and welcome to another bonus episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.840]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.080]   If this is your first time listening to the show, you are welcome to stick around
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440]   for some travel inspiration for your next trip.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.040]   However, you may first want to check out the last episode of the show a couple
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520]   of days ago, where prolific travel journalist, Sebastian Modak, and I talked
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.560]   all about travel from planning the trip to tracking your lost bags, to having
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280]   amazing local experiences and a lot more.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.760]   Towards the end of that conversation, I thought it would be fun to offer up some
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.840]   inspiration to all of you by going continent by continent and sharing some
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.440]   of our favorite places we've traveled around the world.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.320]   So I decided to pull that part of the conversation out to make this episode.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.040]   It left me so excited to travel to a few new places I've never considered.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.720]   So I really hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.080]   I get a lot of emails from listeners saying, "Hey, what are your favorite
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.800]   places to go?
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.720]   Where should I go?
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.040]   I've been to 60 some odd countries, not the 80 some odd you've been."
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.400]   And so I thought, "I'd love to run through continents.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.920]   You've lived on four of them, but I also know I think you've hit all of them and
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.720]   even Antarctica, which I have not.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   We don't need to go too deep, but just to give people some inspiration."
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.040]   At the very beginning, we talked about how might you get some inspiration for
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.640]   places, maybe we just throw some inspiration out, give a line or two about
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.560]   why some could be places that are obvious, right?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   Like I can already tell you I'm going to include Japan and there's no secret that
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.000]   Japan is like a travel destination.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.680]   Were you up for it?
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.520]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.120]   Okay, so I say we start at home.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.440]   I'm going to make you go first.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960]   Start in North America.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.520]   Okay, I'll go first with North America.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   I got to do it.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.680]   And listen, I know people are going to be like, "Yeah, duh."
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   But I'm going to say New Orleans, but I'm going to say not the New Orleans you
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.320]   think of when you think of visiting New Orleans.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.720]   I think you need to go to New Orleans and never step foot onto Bourbon Street,
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.320]   barely even enter the French Quarter and experience New Orleans like someone who
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.120]   lives in New Orleans.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.840]   And that means, yeah, sure, go for Mardi Gras, but go for the actual parades and
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.320]   the parties and the stuff that happens in people's backyards.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.800]   Go for all the other festivals that happened after Mardi Gras and the other
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.320]   fairs.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.800]   I think it is a magical, magical city that's unlike anywhere else, not just in
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.480]   North America, but the world.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.360]   I think geographically, Central America is in North America, if we're talking
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.880]   continents.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   Is that correct?
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.920]   Sure.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   Cool.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   So my whole family took a trip to El Salvador, and we found this small family
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.600]   run eight room hotel on the beach.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.800]   It was almost like a bed and breakfast, but it was kind of operated a little bit
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.040]   more like a resort, but definitely run by a family.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.560]   I'll try to put the name of the place on the show notes.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.000]   Surfing was interesting.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.400]   We'd walk down the beach to the little town right near there.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   It was awesome.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   And then after, I can't remember how we ended up getting to Nicaragua and just
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   staying in the rainforest and exploring.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   And everyone always says go to Costa Rica.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.040]   That seems to be like the primary destination, but I would recommend either
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.960]   of those countries.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.800]   We had a great experience just exploring around where we were staying and kind of
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.960]   a local, I mean, I don't even know what to call this place because it's like you
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   could call it a resort, but you could also call it like a plot of land someone
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   built a few houses on and the family operates it.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.400]   Love that.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.480]   Anything else outside of the US in that area?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.280]   I know we've got a lot to get through, but you know, you've also seen a lot.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.040]   This was one of the 52 places, actually.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.320]   Actually, no, not specifically because I, Panama was on the 52 places list, but
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.360]   there's a little town called Santa Catalina on the Pacific coast of Panama on
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.000]   the West coast.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.920]   It's about a six hour drive, maybe from Panama city.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   When you think of the bohemian surfer paradise, this is it hidden away.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.880]   Tons of locals living there too.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.520]   So it's not the kind of place that's been colonized by foreign surfers.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.320]   Place where just like time slows down.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.840]   I spent just hours just sitting on this huge beach.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.560]   Also happens to be right off of Coiba, which is a national park with some of the
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.080]   best scuba diving in the world.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.520]   So after days and days of just hanging on this beach, eating fresh fish every day,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.560]   I went for a dive in Coiba and at the end of our second dive, I look up and there's
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   just a giant whale shark just circling right above us.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.680]   One of the most incredible experiences I've ever had.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.720]   And it was all in this place that just felt like a place that had been hidden
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.280]   from the rest of the world forever.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.160]   I hope it's still like that after I wrote about it, but I think it is because it
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   felt like I entered a portal into another dimension, honestly.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.320]   In college, so like a long time ago for me, I went to Tamarindo in Costa Rica and
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.240]   it felt like that.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.360]   It was one of the fondest memories of travel I have, but I don't want to go back
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.280]   because I've heard it is not like that anymore.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.960]   I've heard it's not like that either.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.760]   Okay.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.320]   So South America, I'll kick off because I don't have a lot.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   South America is one of the places I haven't traveled a lot, but I enjoyed
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.880]   Cartagena, I thought it was like an incredibly fascinating city.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.040]   Full disclosure, I went on my bachelor party.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.840]   However, it was a city where you just feel like you're in a different place.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.040]   We didn't just do bachelor party things, right?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.560]   Like we went and explored the castle.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.960]   We took a boat out to a random island.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.040]   We just hopped around the island.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   It was awesome.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.960]   And I would recommend it to anyone.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.560]   So I'm half Colombian.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.360]   So full disclosure, my mother's from Colombia.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.240]   I second that recommendation, but I would also encourage people to explore beyond
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.040]   Cartagena too.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.680]   Cartagena is great, especially for a first timer.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.120]   There's a lot of tourism infrastructure there and stuff too, but check out some
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.760]   of the other cities.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.320]   Medellin, which is where my family's from, is not the Medellin of the eighties that
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.800]   people associate with Escobar and everything else.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's a incredibly dynamic, fast growing, super fun city with incredible nightlife
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.520]   and has the energy of a city on the move.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.320]   You really feel it.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.720]   It's also just physically beautiful.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.520]   There's also parts on the coast of Colombia, the Pacific coast that for a
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.240]   long time were largely off limits because of conflict that are now kind of opening
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.000]   up to tourists for the first time.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.160]   There's just so much to see in Colombia.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   I second that recommendation.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   To have something different though, I'm going to go actually a little bit into the
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.000]   Caribbean for this one.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.680]   I think there's a lot on mainland South America that I could recommend.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.880]   Ecuador is incredible.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.040]   City of Quito is worth spending a lot of time in if you can, but I'm going to go
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.760]   actually right off the coast to the island of Bonaire, which is one of the Dutch
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.400]   Antilles, Aruba, and then Bonaire is there as well.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   And Bonaire is another place that I feel like has slipped under the radar for a
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.640]   lot of people for a long time.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.880]   And I think no matter how much I talk about it, at least I'm not going to ruin
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.480]   it because there's something special about it.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.080]   Just another place where you can really slow down, beautiful beaches, some of the
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   best scuba diving in the world, if that's what you're into.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.120]   And just like also a very fascinating cultural milieu of African influence,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.320]   Dutch influence, mainland South American influence, really cool place to just like
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.720]   rent a house on the beach and hang out for a week and pick up fish from the market
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.400]   every morning, cook it in the evening.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.560]   Good place to unplug for that.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.600]   It might be right next to Aruba, but I had the exact opposite experience in Aruba.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.040]   I felt like it's just become the most commercialized, Americanized.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.720]   So it could not be more different.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.640]   It's literally like two sides of a coin.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.520]   It's really interesting that and I think differences at Bonaire, while having nice
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.920]   beaches, it doesn't have those like huge sandy beaches that make for a great
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.480]   setting for huge resorts.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.200]   Right here, it's more rocky beaches.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.800]   It's a little more rugged.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   And because of that, it hasn't had and hopefully never does kind of
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.480]   infrastructure boom that Aruba has had.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.600]   I feel like if we don't speed up, we're not going to get through this.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.000]   So I'm going to encourage us to do a more rapid version in Europe.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   OK, let me go first for Europe.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.280]   Yeah, I'm going to say the town of Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.920]   It's the second biggest city in Bulgaria, one of the coolest towns I've ever been
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.040]   to, just like full of creative energy, young people.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.880]   There's an area called Kapana or something in Bulgarian, but it means the trap
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   because once you get into it, it's like very hard to find your way around.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.680]   It's like this very densely packed cluster of buildings, but it's like full of bars
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.640]   and cafes and cool bookstores, a lot of creative people, a lot of creative energy.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.840]   They call it the other city of seven hills.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.120]   So if Rome has seven hills, so does Plovdiv.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.440]   But these hills are like smack in the middle of town.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.240]   So you can go on a hike through the woods in the middle of the city, come out the
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.720]   other side and be in the second biggest city in Bulgaria.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   Such a cool place.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.560]   I like can't wait to go back.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   It was one of the places on my 52 places trip, actually, that I was like walking
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.720]   around and I was constantly thinking like I could rent a place here for like six
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.480]   months or a year, just hang out, just read and go to the local coffee shop in the
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.160]   morning and right in the evening and had that kind of a Plovdiv.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.600]   I felt that way about Budapest, like being there.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   I was like, we could just move here and it would be amazing, but I'm not going to go
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.520]   there. I'm going to go to Bosnia.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.200]   There are two things that we were in Croatia and we thought, why don't we just
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.120]   rent a car and drive across the border and just see what happens?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.840]   And we drove up to Mostar, which is this like wild city that just feels like
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.960]   amalgamation of like every culture in the world.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.200]   Almost the food was amazing.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.840]   There's the most fascinating people watching because there's this bridge that
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   is famous for jumping off of and you can just relax and sit by the water and you
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   watch these people trying to get people to join the Mostar bridge jumping club,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.160]   which I was just close to doing.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.760]   It didn't do it. If I go back, I'm like, I'm doing it.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.160]   I'm doing it. This is my plan.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.800]   But the one thing I will suggest people do.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.600]   So there is this famous general from the Soviet Union, Tito.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.360]   He built this bunker and I think it's probably the largest.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.160]   I mean, I could be wrong, but it might be one of the, if not the largest bunker in
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.640]   the world. It's gigantic and it's set inside just a random like neighborhood
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.840]   kind of experience. You go into this neighborhood, you go into this house and
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.280]   in the garage, there's just this false fake door.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.040]   You go in the door and all of a sudden you're inside this gigantic bunker that
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.160]   they've kind of turned into an art gallery.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.520]   I don't even know how to explain the experience.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.960]   We had heard about it and we just basically asked every local we could to
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.560]   figure out how it worked. And someone knew someone who had a tour.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.840]   I think it's slightly a little easier to go on now than it was at the time.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.240]   But that is my recommendation is to go explore that.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.800]   In today's dollars, the bunker would have cost over $4 billion to build.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.240]   It's literally one of the most gigantic things.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.560]   I think the hundreds of rooms.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.280]   I wish I had more of the information about it off the top of my head.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.120]   But that tour and experience was just so fascinating and the kinds of people were
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.680]   on it. We had conversations about why they were there, how they learned about
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.000]   it, because it didn't feel like a tourist experience, though.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.080]   I would put it as a tourist experience.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   Thanks.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.880]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.680]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.720]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.920]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly, the go to app
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.160]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.200]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.040]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.440]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.920]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.280]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.680]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.880]   leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.680]   their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.080]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.680]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.720]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly dot com.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.640]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.680]   All right, Africa.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.800]   I guess a lot of options here.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.960]   I'm going to go with the city of Dakar in Senegal, another city that within a few
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.160]   days I was like I could live here for sure.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.800]   Music everywhere.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.160]   Just another city where you just feel the energy of it the moment you step off the
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.000]   plane. People are so friendly, so hospitable.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So many little places to get a whole fish grilled up on the beach.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.560]   I think the whole grilled fish is a common thread between all my choices so far.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.640]   It's a great universal of travel is the whole fish just grilled to perfection.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.200]   And in Senegal, you get that, too.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.720]   Yeah, like music everywhere. Amazing history, both tragic and not in terms of the
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.480]   history. Really cool nightlife with live music everywhere.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:26.040]   Just a really amazing, dynamic, modern city that I think a lot of people, I think
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.920]   people overlook African cities in general.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.480]   If people are traveling to Africa, they're thinking nature, they're thinking safari,
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.360]   they're thinking all these things, which is true.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.840]   It's a reason for it. It's spectacular in terms of nature.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   But I think the cities have a lot to offer.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.040]   This is like one of the youngest populations in the world that are on that
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.160]   continent. Right. So there's just an incredible energy and incredible forward
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.440]   momentum. And you really feel it in a city like Dakar.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.200]   So that would be my pick.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.120]   I like it. I'm going to go a little off the rails here or actually on the rails.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.280]   That was not supposed to be a joke, but it just happened and suggest people check out
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.640]   the Tazara train.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.160]   So it's a train between Tanzania and Zambia.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.840]   We took this, my wife and I, almost a decade ago, a little longer.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.960]   And it was like a three day train ride.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.360]   And almost every person I've ever heard says the train breaks down a little bit every
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.280]   time. You usually end up stopping in a random village.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.120]   Everyone can go explore and you get back on.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.600]   You meet the most fascinating people on the train because people that take a train for
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.640]   three days in Africa have some interesting story to tell.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.840]   Flights in Africa are really expensive, so it's a really affordable way to get around.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.160]   And if at the end of that experience you want a little bit something different, that's
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.840]   maybe a little bit more relaxing.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.280]   You end up in Dar es Salaam and you can take a ferry to Zanzibar, which is kind of this
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.640]   otherworldly, cool island with a lot of both sad and interesting history as well.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.680]   And Zanzibar, I think, has.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.320]   Not the some of the best beaches I've ever seen in my life.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.240]   Yeah. Zanzibar just unreal.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.200]   It's wild. So that's what I've got.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.600]   Obviously, if you haven't taken a safari somewhere in Africa, it's an amazing
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.200]   experience. But I assume that's not something someone needs to be told about.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.280]   Right. This is gonna be the hardest one because it encompasses so many places.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.360]   What are your one to two hot spots in Asia?
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.080]   Oh, yeah, it is really hard, especially because I grew up there for the most part.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   I'm going to skip over Indonesia because that's like an obvious choice for me because
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.640]   that's where I spent my formative years.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   But I'll say plainly, Indonesia, it's endless in terms of the places you can go.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.040]   Literally, there's 20,000 islands or whatever.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.640]   That's a good place to start looking beyond Bali and other things like that.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.000]   I'm gonna say Vietnam. I think the cities especially I'm thinking.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.880]   Playing from north to south, Hanoi, Da Nang and Saigon, I think all offer very
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.040]   different things, and I think the cities are just incredible.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.720]   You'll eat maybe the best you've ever eaten in your life on plastic stools on the
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.600]   side of the road. That's just a attention to detail with the food universally that
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.000]   you don't get in a lot of places.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.840]   And for next to nothing, just a huge part of the culture.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.520]   And I think it's incredible to witness.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.480]   I think you haven't lived till you've tried to cross a road in Hanoi during rush
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.880]   hour and felt the adrenaline rush of that.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.040]   The trick is to keep moving and don't make any sudden movements.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.680]   The motorcycles will go around you.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.560]   Yeah, it's just I mean, again, another common thread, I think, between some of
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.080]   these places I'm picking is just cities that feel so alive and you like can't help
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.000]   but get caught up in that feeling and the current of the place and kind of places
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.280]   where you can just sit down on a plastic stool and sip a coffee and watch the world
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.160]   go by. And it's incredible to witness.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.400]   So that would be one.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.240]   Trying to think of something maybe nature based for the other one, I'm going to say
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.080]   Siberia. I think now, obviously, is not the time to go for geopolitical reasons.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.640]   But if things with Russia ever change, the area around Lake Baikal, which is the
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   deepest lake in the world, is otherworldly.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.560]   There's an island called Olkhon Island, absolutely otherworldly place.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.440]   You feel like you're in a dream, especially if you go in the fall.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   When I went, all the trees are bright yellow because of the changing foliage, wild
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.240]   horses in random corners, long stretches with no humans in sight.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.560]   Just really feels like you've died and gone somewhere else.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.320]   I struggled with this.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.040]   And then I was like, oh, well, I guess the Middle East is in Asia.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.360]   So I have two.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.520]   One is like your Siberia.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.840]   Syria was one of my most memorable places to travel, would also probably not go there
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.080]   right now, though there are reports of people traveling there.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.200]   But we also went to Lebanon, which I thought was just.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.520]   A wild, interesting place that both felt like it had the longest history.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.920]   We went up to the mountains, we went hiking in the mountains, we went to a ski resort
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.120]   in the summer and hung out there.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.840]   There's all of these, I think they're like monasteries surrounding this valley.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.200]   You could basically see every season, every style of architecture, every style of
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.560]   experience from the mountains to the beaches, all in a very small country.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.280]   We drove around the entire country.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.760]   We drove to the south.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.640]   We got calls from our friends in Beirut saying, you're not supposed to drive
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.240]   that far as an American tourist.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.760]   That's not a good idea.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.920]   We never actually felt unsafe as much as people told us we were.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.400]   And then the most interesting thing to me is that there's this weird amalgamation
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   of French and English and Arabic that exists in the country.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.240]   And you'll hear people using all three languages in one sentence.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   Which is something that you just don't hear it that often.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.360]   And I only speak two of the three languages.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.400]   I could understand two thirds of what's going on.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   It seems like they get combined in the calmest and the most aggressive circumstances.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.000]   So it's what people are just saying.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.760]   Hi, it's hi, how are you?
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.600]   And then when people are angry on the street, cursing out of their car windows,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.880]   you catch like bits of every language also.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.280]   But it's a beautiful country.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.560]   It has modern size.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.600]   It has lots of remnants of wars and buildings.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.280]   Your common theme was whole fish.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.600]   I was like, gosh, I went to Bosnia.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.640]   There's lots of buildings that have been bombed.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.280]   I went to Lebanon.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.760]   And so it's amazing to see places that bounce back after those situations.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.600]   You know, so Lebanon was amazing.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.920]   And then mentioned Japan a million times.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.480]   But I think it deserves to be on the list and is probably going to be the place
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.560]   I will travel to more than anywhere else in the world,
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.520]   just because we always keep wanting to go back.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.680]   Yeah, I agree with that for sure.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.640]   But maybe I'll ask you this.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.440]   You've been to Japan.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   You know, as we expand Japan every time, we're like, let's go to a new place.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.400]   Let's go to new place. Any suggestions?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.320]   I mean, I loved the area around like Kanazawa and Shirakawago,
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.000]   I think is that little village in the mountains in the Japanese Alps
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   that looks like it's out of a fairy tale with the sloped roofs.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.240]   It's unreal.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.760]   We went there in the summer and it was just like dream world.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.960]   And I think the trick there is it gets touristy during the day
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.640]   because a lot of people come on day trips, but hardly anyone spends the night.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.920]   So if you spend a night there, you really feel this village
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.680]   that feels like it's from another time.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.200]   And I also loved I went to the area around the Seto Inland Sea.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.240]   So like Setouchi around Takamatsu for the art triennial that happens there.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.720]   I wonder if they've postponed it again.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.000]   I don't know, because the last one was 2019 when I was there.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.880]   And that's just very cool because you have these little islands
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.920]   and each island becomes basically an outdoor art gallery.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.160]   And so you take the ferries around from island to island
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.480]   and you're just like in this alternate reality where there's sculptures
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.960]   everywhere and everything's a museum, basically really special,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.720]   special art event that happens in that area.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.640]   So those would be my outside of the common path recommendations.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.520]   But all that being said is I think I've only been to Japan twice.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.880]   So I've got a lot more to see in the years ahead.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.280]   We had another travel journalist, Brandon Presseron,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.600]   who actually wrote The Lonely Planet Japan Guide.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   And so go back and check that episode out or reach out to him.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.480]   He has like every tip on Earth for Japan.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.320]   I feel like there's just more like Taiwan needs to be on the list.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.880]   India, more than half the world, right?
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yeah, I loved Cambodia.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.400]   I could just go through this long list and there's just the food and the people.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.960]   It's just incredible.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   And I feel like half the world goes to Lebanon and half the world
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.280]   ends up going on a similar experience in Israel.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.600]   And I've done both and they're both fantastic.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.920]   I think go to Lebanon first because I don't think you want the Israeli stamp
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.440]   in your passport going into Lebanon.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.080]   I don't think that works well.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.600]   So if you're debating between the two, I would start in Lebanon
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   and do Israel next or just make sure you don't get the stamp in your passport.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   Most of the time, they won't stamp your passport these days
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.560]   because they know in Israel.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.080]   But someone we were with had the sticker on the back of their passport.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.840]   It's like they didn't stamp the passport, but they had like a little security
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.640]   sticker. Yeah.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.400]   And it was not a fun border crossing for them.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.920]   The food is like the highlight of the Middle East for me and the people.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.240]   So eating with strangers is like my favorite thing to do there.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.520]   Yeah. I'm going to let you take.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.800]   I don't know whether to call it Oceania or Australia feels very biased
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.480]   to call the continent Australia, though.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.880]   I think that's what I grew up learning and Antarctica, because my experience
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   in that whole area is just like a one week city tour of Australia.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.280]   So I'll let you take both.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   So for Australasia, Oceania, whatever we want to call it,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.640]   I'm going to say South Island of New Zealand.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.560]   It's not news to anyone that it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.920]   But I would encourage people to look at the Great Walks,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.200]   which are a collection of different trails that New Zealand has created
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.760]   over the past however many years.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.880]   And there's new ones being added every few years.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.000]   But they're basically like multi day treks you can do.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And I would look for those in the South Island.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.400]   I can't think of a better way to see that nature than by foot.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.000]   Some of them are pretty rugged in terms of backcountry backpacking,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.440]   but a lot of them also have huts along the way that you can reserve.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.200]   So you're not fully exposed to the elements.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.480]   I've only done sections of them and never overnight.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.520]   I've only explored them as part of a story
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.560]   when I was looking around at different trails.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.240]   But I would love to go back and do one of the Great Walks multi day treks.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.280]   So that would be my tip.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.160]   But anywhere on the South Island, especially along the West Coast
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.320]   of the South Island is just.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:57.400]   It's in one day you go from rainforest to glaciers, to alpine terrain,
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.920]   and it's mind boggling.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.760]   You don't even understand how a place like that exists.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.160]   So that would be my tip for Oceania.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.960]   And then, I mean, Antarctica, there's not a ton of options.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.000]   My advice for Antarctica would be the smaller ship, the better.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.280]   You're getting there by ship unless you're Elon Musk trying to get a private jet
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.120]   to the South Pole or whatever, but you're probably getting there by ship.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.280]   So smaller ship, the better.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.400]   And I think part of that is understanding the rules around tourism to Antarctica,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600]   the environmental rules, including the fact that only 100 people
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.160]   are allowed on land at any one time in terms of like landing sites.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.520]   So what that means is if you're on a ship with 700 people,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.920]   you're not going to be able to go out on every landing
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.480]   because they can only have 100 people at a time.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.520]   If you're on a ship with 100 people, you're getting to go out every time.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.760]   So that would be my tip.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.680]   The smaller ship, the better.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.480]   You just have a better experience that way.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.520]   And my other tip would be like, don't even look at the luxury amenities
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.200]   offered on the ship because you're in Antarctica.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.360]   And if you want to spend that time face down on a massage table,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.520]   you're missing the point of being in Antarctica.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.600]   So go for the operator that you think is going to give you
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.840]   the best actual experience on the ground, maximizing your time
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   and interaction with a place that is the closest
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.320]   I think I'll ever get, at least to being on another planet,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.200]   because it is just unreal.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.320]   I don't have words and my job is words.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.480]   But actually, I wrote like 3000 words on it.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.560]   So you can read about it at LonelyPlanet.com.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.480]   I'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.840]   All right. Thank you so much for joining me for this bonus episode.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.920]   I have a Q&A episode coming up soon.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.840]   So if you have any questions you'd like me to tackle about travel,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.120]   credit cards, points or miles, please send them my way.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.560]   Or feedback, guest suggestions, or even if you just want to say hi.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.960]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.200]   You can also DM me on social.
