[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]   My definition of freedom has definitely changed as I've gotten older.
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.660]   When I was younger and I was broke and I didn't have any money, freedom just simply meant having
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.840]   enough time to do whatever I wanted with my life, not being limited by money, being able to live
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.580]   the fullest life that I could without being restricted. So it was this limitless idea.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.420]   And that really was my thinking when I started my financial independence journey. I just need
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.940]   the money to get out. I just need some space. I just don't ever want to be constricted. I don't
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.280]   want to limit what my family can do. I don't want to limit what I can do. I want to make the most of
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.380]   this one life. But interestingly, as I acquired more money, I started to change my definition of
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.680]   freedom. And I realized that freedom really wasn't about unlimited choices. It was just about having
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.800]   the ability to do what you love when you want to do it. And those are two different things. So for me,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.580]   I really struggled with this idea of how am I going to spend my time when I reach financial
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.460]   independence? What am I going to do? And I realized that I needed to create some limits in my life.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.140]   I've realized that freedom really actually only exists within limits.
