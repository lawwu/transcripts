[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.900]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   My name is Josh Ruchites.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920]   I'm your host.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.560]   Today, I want to speak to you primarily about the topic of the value of private money as
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.400]   compared to public money.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.920]   But I want to introduce said topic with a discussion of how the value of money can change.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.160]   Have you ever considered how a dollar becomes something different than a dollar based upon
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.260]   the circumstances of its generation?
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.120]   Let me give you some practical day-to-day examples.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.800]   Let's say that you had a choice between two jobs, job A, paying you $100,000 per year,
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.720]   doing work that you don't particularly enjoy and don't think that you're particularly well
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   suited for, and job B, paying you $100,000 a year, doing work that you enjoy and for
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.180]   which you are personally quite well suited.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.280]   Given the choice, I don't think there's anyone on the earth who would choose job A. Obviously,
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.120]   we want to choose a job that has work for which we are well suited and feel qualified
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.840]   and provides us with some level of enjoyment and appreciation if possible.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.480]   Now, what's interesting though is that we can start to discount the value of the job
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.080]   and we find out quickly that people are willing to work more for less money based upon the
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.000]   attributes of the job.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.600]   So, for example, if I offered you job A, $100,000 a year, doing work that you aren't particularly
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.200]   interested in doing and it's not really well suited for you, and job B, paying you say
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.680]   $95,000 per year, doing work that you enjoy and are well suited for, I think the vast
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.500]   majority of people would clearly still opt for job B.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.240]   Now we could discount it further.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.520]   $100,000 versus $90,000, I bet most people would still choose job B. But there's some
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   number at which the choice changes.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.640]   For example, if I offered you $100,000 a year, doing work that you don't really enjoy and
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.080]   aren't particularly well suited for versus say $30,000 a year, doing work that you enjoy
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.720]   and are well suited for, I think now the majority of people would opt for the $100,000.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.800]   That's due to two basic factors.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:41.280]   Number one, there is a minimum amount of income below which life is not really feasible.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.760]   If you're living at the poverty line and your income is equaling your expenses, then because
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.960]   of the pain of that, you find yourself highly motivated to go and earn more money in order
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.060]   to relieve the pain of poverty.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.840]   At the higher levels, if whatever options you're choosing among are all substantially
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.200]   above the level of your expenses, then it's much easier to appreciate those other lifestyle
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.400]   benefits, shall we call them, more than just the absolute dollar.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.360]   The other thing that needs to be considered is that all work is not created equal.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   It's not just as simple as kind of money versus money.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.920]   For example, if I said $30,000 a year at a job that you like, but there is potential
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.960]   for that to increase in the future, possibly as soon as say two years, then a lot of people
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.240]   then would pursue something like that because of the potential for increase in the future.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.280]   Now, you can decide yourself how much you would discount based upon doing work for which
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   you're well-suited versus work for which you're not well-suited.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.760]   But let's give it another example.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.920]   Let's say that I offer you two jobs.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.480]   Job A pays you $100,000 a year, but requires you to sit in a particular chair, in a particular
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   office, in a particular location each and every day, Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.840]   to 5 p.m., and you must be in that chair at that desk in order to perform the work.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.740]   Job B pays you $100,000 per year, and it requires you to be in that chair to perform the work,
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.920]   but it gives you the opportunity to choose which eight hours in a day you're going to
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   work.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.960]   Now, if you wish to come in at four in the morning and work until two in the afternoon,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.400]   that's acceptable, as is starting at 12 noon and working till 8 p.m.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.080]   Most people would value that flexibility, knowing that it would allow them to go to
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   the dentist at a convenient time for their dental cleanings and coach their kids' sports
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.160]   teams and things like that, and would immediately opt for job B as long as there's enough money
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.000]   in job B to cover their lifestyle, et cetera.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.960]   If it's $100,000, $100,000, obviously job B is going to be chosen.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.560]   If it's $95,000 for job B and $100,000 for job A, okay, probably job B, with, again,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.760]   the same caveats that if we're getting down low, it becomes much more challenging.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   There's a big difference between the numbers, or if we get towards poverty line, if it's
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:25.980]   $42,000 versus $48,000, well, now people are going to opt for the job A, the $48,000, because
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.440]   you need that extra $6,000 to live when you're at that level of income.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   Meanwhile, if the offer is, say, between $200,000 for job A and $180,000 for job B, well, since
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.680]   there's a little bit more margin in the budget, most people would happily give up $20,000
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.920]   in order to have that level of flexibility, as compared to somebody who couldn't give
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.600]   up $6,000 in order to have the level of flexibility, because you need the money for day-to-day
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   expenses.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.900]   Now, we could go on with these examples, and they are important, and I would encourage
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.700]   you to consider them.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.480]   Consider the value of being able to work remotely, work from home, work from travel, two or three
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.540]   days a week, as compared to having to be in the office five days a week.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.500]   For a lot of people, getting a work abroad job is one of the biggest things they can
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.380]   do to improve their lifestyle, and as I pointed out at the beginning of the pandemic, I think
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.120]   this is one of the best lifestyle improvements available to us, and I myself am grateful
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.060]   that today you don't have to go after some harebrained work from home medical billing
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.620]   or envelope stuffing business like was common at the turn of the century.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.000]   Today you can work just about any real job in any career from home.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.300]   On the flip side, however, there are benefits to seeing people.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.760]   I miss seeing people and working with people, and so maybe your job requires you to be at
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.800]   a location.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.040]   Perhaps you're a teacher, and you have to teach in a classroom, but you get the benefits
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.780]   of the social contact with the students, social contact with your coworkers, feeling part
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.240]   of a team, doing something that matters to you.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.560]   Now it's worth it to you because of these other benefits.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.300]   And we should consider as many of these benefits as we are able to identify as being important
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.360]   to us personally, because these things really matter.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.220]   And once you get beyond the poverty level wages, they matter a lot.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.940]   You want to do your very best to consider these in advance.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:23.260]   I have consulted with a significant number of high income earning people who have found
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:30.380]   intense dissatisfaction in the demands of their jobs, the lack of flexibility that their
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.940]   jobs offer.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.380]   And over time, as your wealth increases, as your assets increase, as your income increases,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.100]   every marginal dollar becomes worth less and less because you don't need it anymore and
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.660]   you feel the weight of these other factors very significantly.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.060]   Now I'm not going to dig deeply into taxes, marginal value of taxes, et cetera.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.780]   Just know that there are other financial calculations that should be considered.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.820]   What I want to turn to is one of the things that I think is the least discussed in this
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:10.140]   space, which is the visibility of your income and the visibility of your wealth.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:16.160]   I have a personal theory that the going ratio between the value of an invisible anonymous
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.780]   dollar is worth twice of the value of a visible non-anonymous dollar.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.780]   Let me explain.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.140]   What I mean is simply that if you can earn a dollar in a way that's not immediately connected
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.060]   to your name, to your face, to your likeness, to you yourself personally, if you can earn
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:41.620]   a dollar in some kind of somewhat anonymous business where you aren't particularly visible,
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:48.620]   every dollar that you earn in that capacity is worth about two dollars of income earned
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.340]   in a visible capacity.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.860]   Now let me try to justify that statement a little bit so that perhaps you will believe
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   me.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:04.020]   There are some obvious costs associated with visible earnings and some less obvious costs.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:11.060]   The obvious cost is things like taxes and lifestyle to maintain, maintaining a reputation,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.300]   living a certain way because of your lifestyle.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:21.220]   The less obvious costs are being targeted for your money by investment professionals,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.980]   having friends and family ask you for money constantly, just going to sleep worried at
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.020]   night because of all the crazies that know that you have money.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.060]   If you can avoid some of these costs that I'll go into in more detail here, I think
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   that you should.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.060]   Let's start with the kind of obvious ones.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.220]   The two big ones are taxes and lifestyle.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.220]   Taxes first.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.220]   Let's begin with an example of about a month ago.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.220]   Here's Good Morning America.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.380]   Dr. Shakira's tax fraud trial, the singer reaching a deal this morning, Aaron Koterski
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.100]   is back with the very latest on that.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   Good morning, Aaron.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   Good morning to you, Lindsey.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.120]   Shakira was supposed to go on trial for tax evasion today in Barcelona and prosecutors
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.660]   were seeking to put the pop star in prison.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.280]   Instead, Shakira accepted a plea deal, admitting she failed to pay $16 million in taxes.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.180]   The Spanish government agreed to a three year suspended sentence and a $7 million fine.
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.940]   Shakira had long maintained her innocence, but said in a statement she decided to resolve
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.940]   the case with the best interests of my kids at heart.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.340]   Shakira says she needs to move past the stress.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.900]   The case turned on whenever, wherever Shakira lived between 2012 and 2014.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.660]   At the time, she said her residence was in the Bahamas, but prosecutors said she spent
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.220]   most of her time in Spain while she was with Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique, who's
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.340]   the father of her two children.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.820]   Shakira now says she wants to focus on her upcoming world tour and new album, both of
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.900]   which Robin, she said she is extremely excited about.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:54.900]   So let's use this as an example here, because tax evasion, tax fraud, et cetera, is certainly
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.460]   something we want to avoid.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.820]   But there's an enormous gray area that most people are not familiar with.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.940]   And this is especially hard in the United States, where our tax laws are much clearer.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.660]   It's one of the benefits of citizenship taxation.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.340]   We know that we have to report every dollar we earn, no matter where, no matter when,
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.340]   et cetera, to the US government if we are a US citizen.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.600]   And the clarity of that makes it simple.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.560]   So either you do or you don't, and the consequences come with it.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.760]   By the way, don't commit tax evasion.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.980]   It's a dumb thing to do.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.380]   You will never save enough money to make it worth it.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.460]   And you spend your whole life looking over your shoulder, which dramatically diminishes
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.720]   the value of your dollars.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.900]   So don't do that.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.140]   However, let me explain to you the Shakira case, because it's actually quite interesting,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.980]   and it illustrates the concept that I am driving at.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.340]   Shakira, obviously enormously successful pop star, makes enormous amounts of money.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.940]   Well, she engaged in some very intelligent tax planning many years ago, and she transferred
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:59.220]   all of her property rights, her royalty income, into a business entity, I believe, in Luxembourg.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.860]   And Luxembourg has a favorable tax regime over things like intellectual property rights
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.740]   and royalties, et cetera.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.120]   Their standard amount is to exempt about 80% of income from taxation, which drops you down
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.780]   to about a 5% tax rate.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.820]   I believe that Shakira negotiated with the Luxembourg government and was able to get
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.540]   her tax rate down to 2%.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.300]   And so the total taxation on her income was 2%.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.500]   Now, obviously, all of the income that was going to be paid out of that corporate entity
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.380]   in Luxembourg has to go to her.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.220]   And so she engaged in some additional sophisticated tax planning.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.100]   She established residency in the Bahamas by purchasing property there.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.580]   The Bahamas is a great place to establish tax residency, because you can do it by simply
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.100]   owning property there.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.980]   And then she sent her money to the Bahamas via a series of tax-free banking jurisdictions
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   in the Caribbean, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, et cetera.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.740]   And so as a tax resident of the Bahamas, and with her money flowing from Luxembourg, she's
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.700]   going to be very, very lightly taxed on her income.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.940]   This is good, sophisticated international planning, drops her tax rates from probably
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:12.140]   I would say 99%, but yeah, I don't know, 60%, 50%, whatever the Spanish tax rate would be,
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:18.860]   drops it down to call it 2% in Luxembourg, and follows all the laws.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.660]   Now the problem is she has to make sure that she doesn't become a tax resident of another
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.660]   country.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:32.260]   And so in her case, she started to spend significant amounts of time in Barcelona, and thus violated
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.140]   the Spanish 183-day rule, thus incurring Spanish taxation on her income.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.820]   Now how did the Spanish government know that Shakira was in Barcelona?
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.620]   Well, obviously, because she's Shakira.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.980]   Everybody knows she's in Barcelona.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.300]   She's a star.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.060]   She's very well known.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:57.100]   And so if you know that someone who is visible and making enormous amounts of money is living
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.740]   in your country, and is staying there, and you can see from the tabloids every day that
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:08.980]   she's still here, then you know you've got an absolute ironclad case to tax her income.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.860]   And that's ultimately what the Spanish government did, and they ultimately got her.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.580]   And she settled it, paid the tax bill, et cetera.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.260]   Did you know that when it comes to skin care, your local climate is of utmost importance?

[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.700]   Science advises to choose skin care by your local climate.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.740]   Now why did that happen?
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.460]   Well, first, it happened because she ignored the advice of her team of professional financial
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460]   planners.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.220]   This is frequently what happens.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.740]   A wealthy person or a celebrity, et cetera, will hire a team of professionals to design
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.780]   some useful plan for them.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.060]   The professionals will design a beautiful, perfectly executed plan, and then the celebrity
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.580]   or wealthy person will go on and ignore the details of the plan because they just can't
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.580]   be bothered.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.980]   In this case, undoubtedly, that's what Shakira did.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.200]   Her tax advisors gave her good advice.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.700]   She proceeded to ignore them and said, "Why can't I be in Barcelona?
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.860]   After all, the man I love is in Barcelona.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.860]   That's where I want to be."
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.340]   Now, I have not read court documents and things like that, but all she had to do was not be
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.700]   in Spain that much.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.940]   She could go be there some.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.500]   She could come in as a tourist.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   All she had to do was not be there all the time, but that was too hard for her, and of
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.100]   course, she's paid the price.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.120]   She could have spent significant amounts of time in Spain.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.020]   She could have then spent significant amounts of time in Portugal.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.580]   She could have spent significant amounts of time in England and any other place that she
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.580]   wanted to be.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.180]   She could have flown her family in and out, but because she refused to do what the plan
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.640]   said, she became a Spanish tax resident and ultimately paid the price.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.520]   But I guarantee you today that there are hundreds, probably thousands and thousands of people
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.780]   living in Spain who are violating the exact same Spanish law and who don't come to the
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.940]   attention of the Spanish government.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.540]   And again, don't violate the law.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.940]   Keep track of where you are and don't become a tax resident of Spain unless that's part
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.180]   of the actual plan.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.100]   But the point is that lots of people get away with it because they're not so obvious.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.700]   Their income is not obviously connected to their lifestyle.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.560]   Their income is not obviously connected to them.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.640]   And so be careful of taxes.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   It's much better for you, if at all possible, for you to make a lot of money and not have
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.320]   that money directly connected to you than it is for it to be directly connected to your
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.660]   face, your name, etc.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.320]   Follow all the laws, but you can follow all the laws and put in place certain privacy
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.480]   measures that will help you significantly.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:37.380]   Let's move on to lifestyle because I think this is, in many ways, probably a bigger one.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:44.740]   When people know that you make a lot of money, they expect you to live a certain lifestyle.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.760]   And those expectations upon you really are significant.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.840]   After all, you're not a loser and you don't want to live like a loser.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:01.620]   And so when you make a lot of money, you feel the need to clothe yourself in the external
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.760]   trappings of success.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.020]   And it feels weird to you if you don't do that.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.600]   After all, you know, I could do it and that starts to become a part of who you are.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.860]   And there's no limit to the amount of lifestyle expenses that are available to someone.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:25.720]   There is no fortune so large that it can't be very quickly wasted by a dedicated spender.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.300]   We have evidence galore of this from the world of celebrity athletes, celebrity performers,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   etc.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:40.320]   You can build a lifestyle to destroy any, any pot of money, no matter how large.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.260]   It's always possible to do that.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:50.600]   The problem is when you feel pressured into certain lifestyle decisions, it can often
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.680]   take away your peace.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.880]   And it's much better for you to have the choice to engage in a certain kind of lifestyle because
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:04.200]   you want to do that than it is for you to feel pressured to maintain a lifestyle because
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.080]   of external pressure.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.620]   Let me give you a practical example.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.020]   Let's assume that there are two options between you.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:18.200]   Option one is that you are a brilliant internet business guy, you're a brilliant coder, and
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.700]   you have succeeded in creating a very profitable business.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.220]   You're earning $10 million a year.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:31.160]   Let's say you're living in Miami, Florida, you're earning $10 million a year and, you
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.720]   know, things are great.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.960]   But your business is entirely opaque to everyone around you.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:47.700]   Everyone around you knows that you work online, that you have some kind of business, but they
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.800]   don't know what you're doing and you kind of purposely live rather modestly.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.000]   Yeah, you have a reasonable condo and you're not broke, obviously, but you don't talk about
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.680]   how much money you make, you don't splash money around, etc.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   One of the things that your handsome income allows you to do is to take care of your family
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.620]   and your friends in various ways.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.880]   So for example, let's say that your parents are living in Brazil because you're a Brazilian
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.600]   immigrant, and you're able to support them because they're your parents, you love them
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.720]   very much, and so you arrange and you say, "Mom, Dad, you know, I really want you guys
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.600]   to – I want to retire you, I want you to take it easy," and let's say that you send
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.960]   them something on the equivalent of $3,000 a month, and that plus their other assets
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.040]   and their paid-off home, etc., gives them a very comfortable lifestyle in Brazil.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.500]   And let's say that your sister is living in New York and you want to send her some money
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.600]   from time to time to help her with school expenses for the children, and so once a year
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.720]   you write a check to some private schools for $20,000, and she's enormously grateful
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.160]   because it allows your nieces and nephews to be enrolled in a school.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.100]   So imagine how happy everyone around is, and you yourself are happy because you're making
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.680]   plenty of money, you're saving plenty of money, everyone's doing well, and you're
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.080]   able to help those that you love and care about.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   Now flip that around.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:17.840]   Let's assume that instead of being an Internet programmer and a web entrepreneur, etc., who
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.520]   no one has any idea what he's doing when he's sitting there staring at his laptop,
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.880]   instead of that you're a famous sports star, you're a football star for the Miami Dolphins,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.520]   and you earn $10 million a year playing for the Miami Dolphins.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Well now, everyone knows how much money you make.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.500]   So imagine your parents sitting down in Brazil calculating, "Wait a second.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:52.000]   My son earns $10 million per year, and he's sending me $3,000 per month annualized.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.560]   That's $36,000 a year.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:06.720]   My son thinks that his parents are worth only 0.36% of his income?"
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.800]   Now that incredible gift that they had before that made them feel wonderful about how our
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:20.720]   son is supporting us and what a blessing to be retired by our own son, now it feels ridiculous
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.600]   because it's 0.36% of his income.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.720]   And the same thing happens with your sister.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:34.840]   Your sister previously was happy with the $20,000 a year that you were paying for school,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:40.720]   and now she's sitting there saying, "He earns $10 million a year, and all he can spare is
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.080]   $20,000?
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   That's chump change."
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.840]   It changes everything.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.700]   And this just ripples out through your life.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.880]   Let's say that you were the internet entrepreneur before, and you went out to dinner with your
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.720]   friends, and you just casually pick up the check and pay for a nice dinner out with your
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   friends.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.800]   I don't know, $1,000, whatever it is.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.840]   And ordinarily, your friends are very grateful.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   "Man, what a great blessing!"
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.040]   And you just say, "Yeah, you know, it was an okay month.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   We did fine this month.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   You know, my pleasure.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   Happy to do it."
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.560]   But now, if they know you make $10 million a year because you're a public sports star
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.720]   and your salary is in all of the newspapers, well, now people look at it and say, "$1,000?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Oh, it's nothing.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   He can afford it.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.360]   After all, he makes $10 million a year."
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   And this just ripples on and on and on through your life, and it's a never-ending process.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   That's where the dollars before were received with gratitude by people you gave them to
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.040]   and people you helped out with, et cetera.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:48.000]   Now, just for virtue of being your friend, people are prone to discount the value of
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.360]   the money that you're spending and supporting them with, even though the dollars are all
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   the same.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   So lifestyle is always something that affects you, and I don't want to go too deep on it.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.600]   I don't want to belabor the point, but I do want to just to say, like, this just goes
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.960]   everywhere.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   It goes everywhere in your life.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.800]   If people think you have money and you come in and you start driving a hard bargain on
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.840]   a car or something that you're buying or something silly, then there's just so much conflict.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   It's much better to be perceived as not being particularly wealthy with regard to lifestyle
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   stuff.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.560]   Another huge one is requests for aid, requests for help, requests for charity.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.920]   If people think that you have money, and especially if they know that you have money, then they
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.080]   feel very entitled to continually ask you for money, and that can be very, very difficult
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.760]   because while undoubtedly you want to help people, you want to actually help people.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.480]   And sometimes giving money is a good way to help people, and sometimes giving money is
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.160]   the best way to hurt people, and yet they often don't understand that.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.540]   They often don't have any clue.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.680]   They often don't know that that's the case.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:12.360]   And so even if you choose to help or choose to hurt, not only do you face the same thing
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.320]   about, "Well, I only asked him for $10,000, and after all, he makes $10 million a year
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.720]   and $10,000 is nothing."
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.400]   Even if that's the case, then it continues on, and when you say no, they see it as the
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.240]   money instead of being open to other things.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.040]   So it's a very difficult, difficult scenario.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.880]   Now there are many other areas in which things come along the way.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.400]   Lack of privacy costs you money.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   There's security risks.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.360]   I think Mark Zuckerberg pays something like $40 million – or Facebook pays something
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.200]   like $40 million a year for Mark Zuckerberg's private security.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.520]   So you have security risks.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.560]   There's kidnapping risks for your children.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.800]   You have to live in a certain neighborhood.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.880]   It used to be that maybe some neighborhoods were safe enough you could live.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.400]   Now you got to be in a gated neighborhood.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.720]   You have to have security, et cetera.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.000]   So your whole lifestyle just goes up if people know that you have money because you are now
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.920]   a public target.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.480]   And publicity just attracts crazies, just going to bed every night wondering who's
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.680]   going to show up at your front door tomorrow because some crazy thing happened is an ongoing
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.960]   risk.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.920]   There are many, many costs associated with that lack of privacy, and so you should be
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.120]   very, very careful.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.560]   Now let's flip it around.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.240]   Are there benefits to publicity?
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.320]   I think without question for some people there are, but you should probably be careful to
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.800]   consider those benefits before you seek it.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.160]   There are various levels of publicity.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.480]   Many people are attracted to the idea of being famous.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.960]   I think that's undeniable.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.400]   We live in a world in which so many people want to be famous.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.440]   They want to go viral.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.120]   They want to be well-known.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   I don't understand this myself.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.440]   I don't understand it intellectually, and I don't understand it emotionally.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.120]   It's not something that I have.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.400]   I hate it.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.760]   I hate the tiny little bit of fame that I have because of the fact that you're listening
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.200]   to me right now.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.000]   I despise it with a passion.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.520]   I don't like being recognized.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.480]   I don't want to be known.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.000]   I don't want to be famous.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.480]   So for whatever reason, if it's genetic or circumstantial, I have never aspired to being
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   well-known.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.360]   I've sabotaged many things that I've done because, "Uh-oh, I might all of a sudden become
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   famous."
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.640]   It's very hard to run an internet business that makes a lot of money when you've sabotaged
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.200]   a lot of things because all of a sudden you're going to become famous.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.160]   I don't recommend that.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.600]   But I acknowledge that's something that many people want, and so your mileage may vary.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.660]   I can see some of the benefits of fame for some people.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.040]   So first of all, I can clearly see the benefits of fame if it's going to make you money, and
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.320]   there is no question that you can cash in on fame, on your personal brand, even on notoriety,
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.600]   and it can make you money.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.240]   My rule on things like social media is this.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.780]   If you're making money on social media, you should use social media.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.920]   If you're not making money on social media, you shouldn't use it.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.480]   There's just no benefit to social media, an enormous amount of harm unless you're making
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.720]   money.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.060]   You can apply the same thing.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.000]   There are a lot of people who make a lot of money because of their fame, and there are
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.120]   many, many careers that are only possible because of the fame.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:42.440]   Would you switch places with Shakira or Ricky Martin or Enrique Iglesias or Juanes or whatever?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.960]   I think most of us pretty quickly would because we say, "Well, if I can have the fame and
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.640]   I can have something that I like, clearly I like singing or I like dancing, and I can
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:57.600]   do the thing that I'm good at, then I'm willing to do that in exchange for the money."
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.360]   As I see it, public money is definitely better than no money, but of course private money
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.600]   is much better than public money.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.000]   If public money is your only pathway to money, then it's probably worth pursuing.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   In many cases, many careers I'll talk about in a moment, there's really no way around
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   it.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   There's no way to hide your income.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.920]   If you're a Fortune 500 C-suite executive and your income amount and your stock options
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.760]   is published in every single annual report, there's no way to really hide your money.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.360]   If you are a surgeon and everyone knows that you're a specialized surgeon or anesthesiologist
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.680]   or some other medical specialty, and obviously you make hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   or millions of dollars per year, there's no real way to hide it.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.800]   I'm going to talk about some strategies for that in a moment.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.640]   What you should do is you should be thoughtful about it and you should be clear about what
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   you want.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.120]   I think that if you don't have the instinct to want fame, you should be cautious about
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   acquiring it.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.320]   I was going to wait, but let me stick it in here.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.320]   What's the flip side of fame?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.800]   The flip side of fame is influence, influence.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   If you care about something and you care about making change in the world, then the flip
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.600]   side of fame is influence.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.240]   Fame has a connotation of basically being a self-serving, egotistical thing.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.400]   Influence has a different connotation for us in the English language where it's something
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.760]   that can be used for good or for evil.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.800]   It's power.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.840]   There's no question that fame equals influence equals power.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:49.640]   While I don't love the tiny bit of fame and whatnot that I have, what I do love is I do
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.120]   love the influence.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.000]   When I get emails from listeners, as I frequently do, when I hear that something I've said has
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.360]   been able to help someone positively, when I hear that someone has embraced an idea that
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.920]   I've thought long and hard about and I think is helpful to them, then it fills me with
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   pride and joy because I believe that that influence allows me to make the world a better
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   place.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   That influence allows me to accomplish some of my personal goals, to bend the arc of history
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.440]   a tiny amount in whatever area I can influence.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.200]   If fame is the cost of influence, then in many cases, it's a cost worth paying.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.960]   It's a cost worth bearing.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.440]   It's a cost worth dealing with because of the opportunity to help someone, to serve
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.600]   someone effectively, etc.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.460]   That's the flip side of fame, is influence.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:48.760]   And it's well worth having, but it shouldn't be entered into naively, and fame is not the
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.320]   only way to acquire influence.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:59.560]   Some of the most influential people wield their influence in an entirely invisible manner.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.400]   And to me, that's the ultimate power.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.420]   I don't know how to get there because of the life choices that I made.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.000]   Maybe someday I will.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.600]   And I think that if you could have it all, what would you have?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.300]   You would have money, and the money would be created in a way that was not connected
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.400]   to you.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.040]   Then you would develop influence based upon your character of those who know you, your
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.760]   ideas and the power of them, and the money that you have behind it, and you would wield
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:35.360]   that influence in very lightly seen, hopefully even invisible ways.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.480]   And the only people that really understood the true nature of your influence would be
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.920]   those who were undeniably close to you and could see your character.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.280]   And then that would be very rewarding.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.300]   So in my mind, that's the ultimate thing to have.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:56.840]   It's just very hard to know how to get there because fame and notoriety, etc., can be a
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.320]   pathway to money, money can be a pathway to influence, etc.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.860]   So it can be a very confusing muddle to try to work your way through when you're dealing
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.360]   with this in a normal fashion, trying to figure out what business do I start.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.960]   And the reason I'm making this show today is because this is something that very few
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.840]   people think about when they're starting a business.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.760]   They don't think about it when they're creating their entities.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.240]   They don't think about it when they're putting their face on things or their name on things.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.040]   And in many cases, you can build things without your face and name on them, and you should
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.640]   consider if you would rather have that than something with your face and name on it.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:42.980]   In summary, public money is better than no money, but private money is much better than
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.280]   public money.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.160]   Private money preserves your options, it allows you to come and go as you like with minimal
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.640]   risk, it keeps your costs down.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.400]   Unless it's making you money or developing influence for you, I don't think you ever
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.880]   win when flaunting your wealth.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:05.280]   And so it's much better for you to keep yourself modest if at all possible.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.960]   And by the way, this is one of the reasons that I am suspicious of anybody who leads
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.760]   with lifestyle.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.240]   There's a balance here, but I've spent so many years reviewing financial statements
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:24.880]   to know that half the people that live a very flashy lifestyle can afford it, and their
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.800]   flashy lifestyle is evidence of the fact that they have plenty of money.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.760]   And half the people that live a flashy lifestyle can't afford it, and their flashy lifestyle
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.480]   is based upon fakery and lies.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.520]   It's an elaborate scheme, it's bait to try to lure you in, you're the sucker.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.400]   So especially in the financial space, when I see people living a flashy lifestyle, and
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.760]   here it's especially bad when it's an extreme lifestyle, I don't know, Dan Bilzerian or
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.560]   something like that, living in an enormous house, I just assume that it's all a giant
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.360]   con game, and I'm the sucker that they're trying to get, and I just start with that
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   assumption.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.920]   And I guess thankfully I grew up near Palm Beach, and basically every Palm Beach bazillionaire
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.800]   that I ever interacted with, there was no question that they had money.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.640]   After all, you're sitting in a $45 million mansion on the water, and there's no question
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.880]   that they have money, and there's no financing on it, etc.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:29.400]   But every genuinely wealthy Palm Beacher that I interacted with always had some more modest
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.840]   expression of wealth.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   And it's not to say they didn't buy fancy stuff, of course they did, there's plenty
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:42.720]   of yachts and plenty of things, but there's just a modesty of expression that for me has
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:49.800]   always been, continues to be connected with those who are genuinely wealthy in a way that
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.520]   some wacko on the internet doesn't – the guy on the internet who's showing off the
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.400]   flashy stuff doesn't express himself in that confident way that all of the genuinely
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.440]   bazillionaire people that I've ever interacted with do.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:14.200]   And so it's not as simple – millionaires don't drive Toyota Corollas, it's not
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:21.160]   the millionaire next door kind of vibe, it's that there's a general modesty about life
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.600]   that matters.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.320]   And I meant to cover one more thing about attracting genuinely good people into your
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.440]   life with expressions of wealth, but I'll do that in this context.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.680]   I want to pivot to this idea.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.200]   What if you can't hide it?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.840]   After all, it's all well and good that if somebody wants to make $10 million from his
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:46.600]   laptop as I've always aspired to, but it's another thing if it's possible.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.320]   Again, you work your way up in a company and your salary is known or you work in a specialty
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.960]   where people know that you make money, it's just unavoidable.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   Well, here I think your basic strategy, if at all possible, is just always lie about
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:13.840]   your money, always lie down and make comments about, "Eh, things aren't as great as
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.520]   they seem."
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.800]   And again, there's a difference between somebody who is perceived to make money and
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.120]   somebody who we know exactly how much they make.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   Let's use an example.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.920]   Let's say that you're a physician.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.880]   There are a lot of physicians who make $2 million a year, $3 million a year just from
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.160]   their medical work, say nothing of other businesses.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.120]   And there are a lot of physicians who make $200,000 a year, $300,000 a year, etc.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.280]   And so I was working with a client recently and I gave this exact advice.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.700]   She was a very successful physician.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.040]   She was earning, I think, something like $3 million.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:59.680]   And I pat myself on the back, some of it through some of the advice I'd given her where she'd
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.760]   gone from making a few hundred thousand dollars a year to a few million dollars a year.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.700]   And it was her work, but I was happy to see her progress over the years when I most recently
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.240]   spoke to her.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:17.340]   And the point was, I said to her, I said, "Just cause the impression to be that you
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.020]   make $300,000 a year instead of $3 million a year."
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:26.440]   Because people can't distinguish and differentiate between those things.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:32.540]   It would be ridiculous for you as a physician to somehow try to represent that you make
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.640]   $30,000 a year.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.360]   We all know that's not true.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.160]   But it's not ridiculous for you to represent that you make $300,000 a year in basically
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.980]   the way that you talk, the things that you do, etc. as compared to $3 million a year.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.680]   The day you say to your friends that aren't in your social class or your economic class,
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:58.660]   which is common, the day that you say to them that you make $3 million a year is the day
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:04.260]   that they stop appreciating every time you buy dinner, every time you fund a fancy event,
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.780]   every time you get the hotel and front row seats for a great concert, etc.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.940]   Now they just start to expect it.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.000]   Instead of looking at you and just being grateful that you were able to do that for them, now
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.820]   they look at it and say, "Oh, it was no big deal for her.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.340]   Of course she could do that."
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.920]   On the flip side, if someone thinks that you make $300,000 a year, they understand you're
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.980]   not broke, obviously, but they still appreciate it when you pick up the tab for dinner.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.820]   They still appreciate it when you organize a $5,000 weekend or things like that, because
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.740]   they don't understand what a small percentage of your net worth it is.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:45.760]   It doesn't change their perception like it would if they did know how much money you
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.760]   make.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.080]   People don't know what it's like to make $200,000 a month.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.740]   They have no clue.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:59.120]   Because they have no clue, it's better to keep that quiet and only share that with trusted
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.580]   advisors.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.160]   Again, this is not always possible.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.320]   There are two ways to go about it.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:13.900]   Number one is just in your actions and in your behavior and in your comportment, whatever
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:20.100]   you do, the things that you buy, et cetera, you can live a great lifestyle that is appropriate
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:27.540]   to you, but don't be so splashy as to cause people to think that your earning capacity
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.020]   is genuinely what it is.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   That's the first thing.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.280]   The second thing is if you're willing to, you can just make comments about your poor
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.900]   management of money.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.240]   I think that's a reasonable strategy.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.940]   If somebody thinks that you make tons of money and they know it, let's say again your very
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.520]   high income is reported on a financial statement, a publicly disclosed financial statement for
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.360]   anybody who wants to know and say it, then you can whine about your expenses just as
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.560]   much as anybody else does.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.860]   There are good reasons to do that.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:04.100]   I don't love the idea of dishonesty of that, but there are good reasons to not make it
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.520]   seem like you're worth tons of money.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.960]   Remember that especially when I've talked about asset protection planning, et cetera,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:19.380]   the first strategy with asset protection planning is just not to be a target.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:26.120]   People with heavily laden pockets are generally going to be targeted in a way that people
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.680]   with very light pockets are not.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:41.580]   Maybe your salary itself is quite ample, but you develop some side business and your side
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.700]   business sucks up all your money or you spend all your money on your horse racing business
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.380]   or you send all your money on your wife's charitable organization and it sucks all the
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.220]   money out, et cetera.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:58.820]   If you want to use that as a form of impression, I get a little uncomfortable with this.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.520]   That's why it's always better to avoid it just because I don't like any hint of dishonesty,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:09.740]   but I think that that's an appropriate strategy to employ at times is some complaints about
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.460]   how much money this charity sucks up from us or how much money this business.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   We had a terrible year.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.580]   We lost money, et cetera.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.860]   You are in control of some of those things and it's worth your employing those strategies
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   on occasion.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.860]   Now, earlier, I neglected to talk about some of the other social benefits because – and
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   I meant to.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.860]   It was my mistake.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.200]   When I think about fame, fame and notoriety, and I talked about influence, that influence
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.940]   can be on a broad scale, but it can also be on a personal scale.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:44.420]   What I mean is if you're a heavyweight person, that is valuable.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:52.260]   Being perceived as a heavyweight person, a serious man or woman is important and is valuable.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:00.100]   The word I'm using, heavyweight or serious, is intentionally more than money.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.980]   You're not a serious person just because you have money, but money is a component of
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   it.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.980]   And so if you desire to make a difference in the world, if you desire to have influence
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:19.200]   and impact, you want to cultivate an air, a reality that is also going to have an air
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.260]   of being a serious person, somebody who is intentional.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.820]   Part of that has to do with the quality of the ideas that you consider, the quality of
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:34.140]   your personal philosophy, the intelligence of the way that you speak, the way that you
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.300]   act, the wisdom that you have to share, etc.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.220]   But then it also wants to be backed up with money.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:47.340]   And so I think the best path is if you genuinely are just simply concerned about something
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:54.220]   that is important and you're not just making small lies and misdirection about how your
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.200]   charitable endeavor and your family foundation is sucking up all your money.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.180]   But in reality, it's genuinely true.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.820]   Not that it's sucking up all your money, but that you are involved in something serious
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.340]   and something that's important.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.460]   For the ones who get it done, the most important part is the one you need now.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.180]   And the best partner is the one who can deliver.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.240]   That's why millions of maintenance and repair pros trust Grainger, because we have professional
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.820]   grade supplies for every industry, even hard to find products.

[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.480]   Grainger for the ones who get it done.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:41.040]   To me, that's the ethically superior way where you genuinely are concerned with things and
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.540]   you genuinely are investing in things that matter to you.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:52.460]   And the exact numbers never need to be said, but you get all of the benefits of money,
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.700]   of being known that you have money because you're a serious player in the area that you're
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.700]   involved in.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.440]   You get all the lifestyle benefits of money because it's not hidden, but you also get
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.200]   all the benefits of being a serious person and you're just not being frivolous.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.020]   That you are making a change in something, you're focusing on something, you're trying
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.800]   to send a man to Mars or you're trying to solve homelessness in your area, et cetera.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:23.900]   And to me, that's the best solution is to be in that space and in that space where you're
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.580]   a serious person and you're making a serious change.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:35.080]   It's not the number of zeros on your income or the number of zeros on your wealth that
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.940]   truly matter.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:42.900]   It's the seriousness of your ideas and the money is not optional, but there's a broad
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:49.020]   degree of acceptability in the money that matters.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.300]   And this is a strategy that you can employ if you have public money and this is a strategy
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.700]   that you can employ if you have private money.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.700]   It doesn't matter.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.180]   What matters is the size of the impact that you're making.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:06.300]   What matters is the size of the contribution you're giving to the area that you care about.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:12.420]   And this will in many ways be your ticket out of the frivolous consumption club and
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.700]   into the exclusive club of heavy hitters who are doing something.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.420]   And this is where I want to close.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:31.100]   What people who have not built wealth I think often don't understand is that it's necessary
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:41.140]   for wealthy people to basically exclusively surround themselves with wealthy people in
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.220]   order for them to function.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:48.940]   And so all of the accoutrements of wealth, the private exclusive neighborhoods, the high
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:54.700]   price tags to be in those exclusive neighborhoods, the private clubs with very high entrance
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:47:00.020]   fees, the exclusive schools, et cetera, these are all part of the screening mechanism that
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:05.260]   allows wealthy people to be comfortable, to be comfortable because they're surrounded
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.580]   by people who understand.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:12.020]   And again, it goes back to that difference of buying a $1,000 dinner for your friends
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.100]   versus not.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:21.780]   If you're at the Everglades Club on Palm Beach, nobody is worrying about the $1,000 dinner
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.900]   or the non-$1,000 dinner.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:32.980]   And everybody understands that we're all here at this table because we've done the hard
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.140]   work and we know what it's like to be at this table.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:40.860]   We've all been in that situation where we had the experience where we picked up the
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.820]   $1,000 tab for other people and they either really appreciated it or they didn't appreciate
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.180]   it and they thought, "How ridiculous.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.060]   After all, my son makes $10 million a year.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.860]   How can he only find it in his heart to send me $36,000 a year?"
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:01.820]   Those shared experiences are some part of what it means to become wealthy.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:07.580]   And people who have had those experiences often want to be with people who understand.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:14.420]   Now, I'm not a member of the Everglades Club and I wouldn't tell you if I were, but I just
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.300]   think of an example I would share.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:22.860]   Back when I was an insurance agent, one of my friends said to me, "You know, I really
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:31.580]   only go on vacation with other insurance agents because we're about the only ones who can
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:36.460]   take a week off randomly here and there on the spur of the moment and go skiing because
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.340]   the snow is good and let's go and fly across the country and go skiing."
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:47.700]   And there's just a lifestyle comfort level that I have to be with people that understand
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.260]   that I have the ability and my schedule to do what I want to do when I want to do it
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.540]   and I have the money to pay for it.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.740]   And it's a modest amount of money that you need to do that, but it's more of a lifestyle.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.900]   And that's, I think, what many people are looking for is they're looking for a sense
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:08.060]   of comfort with lifestyle, to be with people who understand, to be with people who are
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:14.820]   not going to put awkward pressure on you, to be with people who understand the crazies
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:21.220]   that are attracted with publicity and fame, etc., to be with people who understand.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:27.420]   And so I hope I've articulated that in some effective way, that there is a genuine difference
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   of lifestyle that wealthy people have lived versus non-wealthy people.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:38.340]   And it's those experiences that make it very important for wealthy people to largely just
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.740]   surround themselves with their peers.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.220]   And that's not something that you're going to fake.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.500]   That's not something that you are going to hide.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.580]   There's no one faking his way into the Everglades Club.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:56.180]   And those kind of elite institutions are designed in such a way to eliminate the fakery.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.060]   The Internet is not going to eliminate the fakery.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.540]   The Internet is going to promote the fakery.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.260]   But the elite institutions do eliminate the fakery.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:11.240]   And they are all oriented towards exclusivity, privacy, modesty, etc.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.900]   That's why those institutions exist.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.500]   So in summary, think carefully about the things that are important to you when earning your
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.580]   income.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:25.780]   Think carefully about how you earn it, work that you enjoy, etc., and recognize that you
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.780]   have some influence and choice in these affairs.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:32.780]   Ten years from now, you can be in a different space depending on where you are and how you're
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.140]   there.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:40.200]   Think carefully about earning your income in a public manner and recognize that there
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:47.100]   are costs associated with that and there are costs associated with your decisions.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.700]   I don't think that one is right and one is wrong.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:57.900]   Years ago when I was young, I just was always attracted to the private money approach.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.620]   And then here I am with a podcast violating my own principles.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.540]   But it always seemed to me the superior option.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:10.220]   And just the kind of the hassle that I was with a friend of mine a few weeks ago who
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:21.180]   is a very accomplished surgeon and he was lamenting about how he gets multiple calls
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.740]   every week of financial advisors going after him, etc.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.940]   And it's like, that's a price that I don't pay, but he pays.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.500]   And just being silly, but it's real.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.700]   Those things are real.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.220]   And so be careful and be thoughtful about how you generate your money.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:40.980]   If you can generate your money that's not connected to you, I think that's the way
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:41.980]   to go.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.340]   But it can be hard to do it.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:48.140]   So public money is better than no money, but private money is infinitely better than public
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.140]   money.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.180]   Keep that in mind as you earn your income.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.140]   Keep that in mind as you spend your money.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:59.300]   Keep that in mind as you talk about your money and recognize that two people can keep a secret
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.980]   when one of them is dead.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.780]   So be very cautious.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:09.180]   You're often the one who creates your own successes and failures based upon the words
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.180]   that come out of your mouth.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.180]   Thank you for listening.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.820]   I hope this has been useful to you.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:13.980]   I'll be back with you very soon.
