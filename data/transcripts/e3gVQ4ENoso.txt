[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Jesus Christ is a real, true, living friend.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   He is the Christian's closest friend.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   But like any relationship, it's a friendship that must be maintained by mutual knowing.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So how do we come to know Christ and to learn to trust Him more and more over time?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   In other words, how does Christ become a more and more real friend in our lives?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   That was a question tackled by John Piper in a 2011 sermon on John 8, verse 31.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   If you want to know Jesus, be much in His Word.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   One of the most important convictions I ever developed, and I commend it to you,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   one of the most important convictions you could ever form,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   is that Jesus, as a real, living, precious, present, experienced friend and person,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   is known chiefly through His Word.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And the only reason I use the word "chiefly" instead of "only"--
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I first wrote "only" when I wrote this.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Only.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And in a sense, that would be true.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Here's the reason I stepped back from "only" and wrote "chiefly" for this reason.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   You know it from Paul in Philippians 3.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You'd know it if you've walked with Jesus a long time,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   that as you walk with Him through His Word, by His Word,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   communing with Him, trusting His promises, striving to obey His commandments,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and enjoying His fellowship, I will be with you to the end of the age.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   As you walk with Jesus hour by hour over 10, 20, 30, 40 years,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   you walk through very, very deep valleys, very much suffering, very many hardships.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And in those hardships, Jesus proves Himself in a way that you know Him
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   in a way you could not any other way.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Any other way.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And therefore, even at those moments, it is by His words.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm almost tempted to go back and change it to "only."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But I wanted the chance to say that.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I wanted the chance to just say that experience with Jesus,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   experience lived out daily walking, trusting, right now,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   in this horrible, horrible, horrible thing,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   there's a knowing, there's a knowing there that comes that you don't get anywhere else.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Nowhere else.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And yet, it's by His Word at those very, very moments.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Let me give you a verse to hold on to for this,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   because this is just massively important for living your Christian life.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And knowing Jesus moment by moment.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   1 Samuel 3, verse 21 goes like this,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   "The Lord revealed Himself to Samuel by the Word of the Lord."
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   The Lord revealed Himself by the Word of the Lord.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That is a structure of reality that controls my whole life.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I want to know Jesus.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Not just books.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Not even just the Bible.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   As precious as it is.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I want the person of Christ.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He's risen.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He's risen.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   He is here by His Spirit.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He is as much a person, more than all of us are.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And He's in this room right now, listening to what we say.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'll be with you.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And I want to know Him.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I want to commune with Him.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Fellowship with Him.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Talk to Him.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Listen to Him.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Be helped by Him.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Be drawn by Him.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Be strengthened by Him.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I want to know this Jesus and walk with Him hour by hour.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   How shall that happen?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Answer, the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel by the Word of the Lord.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   If you try to run after the Lord without running through this, you will find someone else.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Don't feel like that makes you some kind of pedantic academic.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Like, "Oh, you've got to be a scholar, blah, blah, blah."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The least educated person may have the deepest grasp of Jesus through this book.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   There's no correlation between higher education and sweet fellowship with Jesus through the book.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   What does it mean to be in the Word that is summed up in Jesus?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And all these words that mediate Jesus.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What does it mean to be in it?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   If you abide in my Word, you are truly my disciples.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So here's a picture.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I'm going to push this picture and maybe it'll stick.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And I think it's faithful to the Scriptures.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   The Word of Jesus, with Himself at the center and the focus, has a force field around it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   This is an image.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Like a magnetic field around it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And when you are in His Word, you're in that force field.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You're under the sway of the force emanating from the Word.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Let me illustrate that.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Part of this force field is the truth of the Word.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So when you're in the Word, you're in the persuasion of the truth of the Word.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You're in the grip, the hold of the force of the persuasion of the truth of the Word.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The Word is compelling persuasion and you're in it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's got you like that.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So when you correlate your being with truth, it's persuasion.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I'm there.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'm drawn in.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I'm compelled.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Second, the force field is created by the beauty of the Word.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And this beauty attracts.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So when you move into the Word, you're attracted and held by the beauty of the Word.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Third, this force field is created by the supreme value of the Word.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So when you're in the Word, you're captured by the preciousness of the Word.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   As God opens your eyes to see the beauty and the preciousness and the value of the Word,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   it compels, it attracts, it draws.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   This field pulls you in, in to the Word.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Fourth, there is a power and a grace creating this force field so that as you see this power
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and you see this grace and you're drawn to it, there is an experience of peace because of the grace
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and restfulness because of the power.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   The power and the grace conspire to guard your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And in the Word, you are held by a peace that passes all understanding.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Another part of this force is the life-giving, soul-sustaining bread of heaven.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The Word is the bread of heaven.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And therefore, when you're in the Word, you're in the nourishment of the Word.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   You experience yourself being nourished.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Like sitting on the couch Saturday morning, Noel's gone to a seminar and Talitha's gone off to her event
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and I'm all alone in the house with my iPad and my Bible program, and I am feeling so nourished.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I wouldn't get up from this moment for anything unless I had to.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I am being fed in my soul.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   How could I leave? I'm in the Word, in the nourishment of the Word.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   That is a sweet reminder from a man who has been a friend of Christ for many decades,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   John Piper, from his 2011 sermon titled "If You Abide in My Word, You Are Truly My Disciples"
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   on John 8:31.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   This clip was sent in to us from Brady in Richfield, Minnesota.

[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   [END]
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   [END]
