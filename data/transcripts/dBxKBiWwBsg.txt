[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.080]   Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, in chapter 15, reading from verses 8 to 11.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.640]   Verses 8 to 11 in the 15th chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, "And last
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.680]   of all, he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time, for I am the least of the
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.040]   apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   God.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.500]   But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.600]   in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   which was with me.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.920]   Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so he believed."
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   Now we were considering the first part of this great and well-known, familiar chapter
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.680]   last Sunday evening.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.800]   The apostle here is reminding the members of the church at Corinth of the great fundamentals
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   of the Christian faith.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.160]   The need for that had arisen because they had got into a terrible state of muddle and
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.560]   of confusion.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.760]   They had been arguing amongst themselves with regard to certain preachers.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.760]   They had been tolerating grievous sin amongst them.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.080]   They had been boasting of their understanding, some of them, in their great gifts.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   They had been abusing even the communion service, some of them eating and drinking too much,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220]   even at the love feast that generally preceded the communion service.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.720]   They were all arguing about tongues and these various spiritual gifts, and there were people
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.400]   who were introducing false teaching.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.680]   There were those who said that Paul was more or less a simpleton, that he was not a great
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   philosopher.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.560]   They said his presence is weak and his speech contemptible, and because he hadn't used
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.480]   the manners and the mannerisms of the schools, the various and famous philosophical schools,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.220]   they said that he was not worth listening to.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.040]   They were great philosophers, and they wanted to philosophize this gospel.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.680]   Some of them were even denying the literal, physical resurrection, particularly of Christian
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680]   people.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.120]   There was no such thing, they said, as resurrection at all, and couldn't be.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.520]   Well, the result of all this was that this church was in a state, as I say, of incredible
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   confusion and misunderstanding and turmoil.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.720]   And the apostle says that he's even beginning to doubt whether some of them had ever really
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   believed.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.900]   He says, "By which answer you were saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.760]   you, unless you have believed in vain?"
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.040]   He says, "You know, I've got to tell you again what the first principles of this Christian
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.920]   faith really are.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.560]   You've been so interested in the implications of Christianity that you've forgotten what
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   Christianity is.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.960]   And now I'm calling attention to all this because the same condition prevails today.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.040]   The Christian church, alas, is in this Corinthian condition, utterly confused.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   And it's not surprising, therefore, that the masses of the people should be outside the
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   Christian church.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.080]   And it seems to me that the first thing we need to do is to keep in memory, as he exhorts
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.720]   these Corinthians to do, the things that he'd already preached to them."
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.440]   So he reminds them of them.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   Now, last Sunday night we were reminding you of the message of the Christian faith.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   Here it is.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.520]   "I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also received, how that Christ died
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.680]   for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.280]   the third day according to the Scriptures."
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.760]   This is not philosophy.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   This is history.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.320]   This is facts.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.080]   The Christian message is an account of what God has done in this world, in the person
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.880]   of his only begotten Son, for us men and our salvation.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.480]   And the thing that the apostle put in the first position in his preaching in Corinth
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.520]   was not so much even the teaching of Christ as his death, his burial, his resurrection.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.440]   And we saw why he has to do this, because those are the things by which we are saved.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.240]   We are saved not by philosophy, but by what God has done in Christ.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.400]   God was in and through Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.560]   It is these facts that save us, and we therefore worked out the meaning of the facts.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.880]   Well now, there is the Christian message.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.400]   But tonight we come to another aspect of this whole question of the very fundamentals of
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.980]   the Christian faith.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.120]   If that is the Christian message, how does it come to us?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.060]   How does it affect us?
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.240]   How does it become relevant in our daily lives and living?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.840]   Or, if you like, how is it applied to us?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.720]   Now that is the theme that we are going to consider together tonight.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.640]   And we are going to do so in terms of what the apostle Paul tells us here so plainly
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   about himself.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.700]   He brings it in, you remember, in connection with this question of the witnesses of the
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.660]   resurrection.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.060]   He says he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.500]   He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.180]   After that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.980]   remain unto this present, but some have fallen asleep.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.440]   After that he was seen of James, then of all the apostles.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.460]   And last of all, he was seen of me also.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.020]   And so he brings in himself and his own personal experience.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.060]   Now I say we are going to look together at this man, and how he became a Christian, in
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   order that we may learn how this great message of salvation does come to us individually,
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.620]   in a living and in a true manner.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.540]   Now some of you may say, well, but Paul was a very exceptional man, and his whole story
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.540]   is exceptional.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.100]   Well, you are quite right, of course.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.040]   He was a most unusual man.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.980]   He was by natural birth one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever known, a man endowed
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.540]   with unusual and quite exceptional propensities and capacities.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.540]   And not only that, he had a very special upbringing as a Jew and then as a Pharisee, and what
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.780]   happened to him on the road to Damascus, of which we were reading at the beginning in
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.420]   Acts 28, was of course a very unique experience, something that has not been repeated.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.820]   He was the last who was given this vision with his naked eyes of the risen Lord.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:44.300]   Now you are quite right, all this is quite exceptional, but this apostle himself is the
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.380]   one who insists more than anybody else that in spite of all that is exceptional in his
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:59.220]   story, what made him a Christian is exactly the same as in the case of everybody else.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.260]   Though he is so far removed from us in a natural sense in terms of his glittering gifts, as
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.500]   a Christian he is in the same position as every single one of us.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.540]   Well, he goes out of his way to say that in many, many places he tells us that he himself,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.900]   as we are going to see, is only a Christian by the grace of God.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.100]   He repeats it in writing his first letter to Timothy, "How hopeless he was, but I obtained
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.400]   mercy," he says.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.540]   The apostle Paul as a Christian, quite Christian, is in exactly the same as all of us.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.460]   So don't be misled by the dramatic incidence.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.580]   These vary from case to case.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.540]   If we were to take the personal case history of every Christian in this gathering tonight,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.260]   we would find great variation in the circumstantial, in the incidental things.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.120]   But that is not what matters.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.240]   What matters is this thing that is common to all of us who are Christians.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.300]   And therefore it is true to say that in the case of the apostle Paul, what made him a
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.940]   Christian is what makes everybody else a Christian, in spite of the dramatics.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.180]   It is the same process that he underwent, that all of us have undergone who are Christian,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.820]   and all must undergo whoever will become Christian.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.580]   Very well, then.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.160]   If you like, I'll put my whole case tonight in a different way.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.780]   What is a Christian?
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.820]   What is a Christian?
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.700]   And how does one become a Christian?
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.860]   Let's see the answers as they're given to us here.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.260]   The first thing, of course, we've got to emphasize is this, that it is always something
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.100]   personal, intentionally personal.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.920]   It is personal experience.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.160]   It is something that one experiences personally and individually.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.420]   You see, his case is, "I am what I am."
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.980]   Now, this is the thing, "By the grace of God, I am what I am."
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:12.180]   Now, you notice, this is all a great emphasis upon the personal aspect, the personal experience.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.900]   This, of course, is the common teaching of the whole of the Bible, from beginning to
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.900]   end.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.020]   A Christian is a man who is in a personal relationship to God.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.300]   Now, I know that this is something which is most unpopular at the present time.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.780]   It is something that is a particular source of annoyance to the typical modern man.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.780]   There is greater opposition, I imagine, and I gather from my reading and from what I hear
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.820]   and see, to this personal emphasis in which I'm indulging now and which I'm stressing
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.780]   than there is, perhaps, to any other aspect of the Christian message.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.100]   You see, what they say is this.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   "That's it," they say.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.940]   "It's so typical of you Christians.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:03.500]   You're so small, you're so small-minded, you're so self-centered, you're so selfish,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.420]   you're turning in upon yourselves.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.460]   With a world such as this is tonight, you are concerned about your little soul and your
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.260]   own personal salvation."
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.260]   You've heard it, haven't you?
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.220]   Perhaps you've said it.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.020]   This is the Communist charge that is brought against this evangelical presentation of the
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.860]   Gospel, that at a time like this, we must begin to think socially, we must begin to
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.940]   think politically, we must begin to think even racially.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.820]   We mustn't be just concerned about the mumps and measles of our own little souls and my
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:42.180]   own personal destiny with the world and its teeming masses in the state and condition
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.180]   they're in tonight.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.660]   Now, this is something which is abominable to the modern man, and he hates it and rejects
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   it.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.460]   Indeed, the whole tendency in life today is to depreciate the place and the value of the
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.460]   individual.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:06.620]   Everything is thought of in terms of groups, everything is done in terms of committees.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.260]   The whole notion of the great man is abomination today.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:17.500]   People don't like this, a kind of anonymity, the common herd, the common level.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.940]   This is the thing that's being exalted.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.380]   Everybody wants to look like everybody else, and people, you know, no longer know what
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.380]   people look like.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.380]   You can't tell.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.180]   They all make themselves look the same, a kind of anonymity, and we're all lost in
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.700]   the mass, the mob, and the individual, I say, is being depreciated.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:44.660]   And the whole emphasis upon this bigger outlook, we should have a social concern, a concern
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.500]   about the world and its great problems, and not be ever turning in upon ourselves and
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   always worrying about our own little lives and what's happening to us.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:59.420]   You're familiar with the argument, well now, I'm here to assert that that is, of course,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:05.260]   the essence of the modern fallacy, and that this biblical message is always primarily
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.260]   personal.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.260]   It doesn't stop at that.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.780]   I hope to deal with the other aspect of the week tonight, but what I'm asserting tonight
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.660]   is that it always starts with the individual, as it does here.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.820]   It's personal, and a personal experience.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:25.100]   Now, this, I say, has been the great fallacy, especially in the last hundred years, and
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.260]   especially, perhaps, this present century.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:37.980]   It has been all due to the failure to realize what the gospel alone can see and does assert,
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:44.580]   that after all, society consists of individuals, and that you'll never change society until
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.900]   you change the individuals that are in it.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.140]   This, I say, is the very essence of the modern fallacy.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:56.380]   It is since we've been ignoring the individual and concerned about reforming and improving
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.700]   and changing society that things have gone from bad to worse.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:07.880]   Conversely, it would be very simple for me to demonstrate to you from the pages of history,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.020]   that the periods of greatest social and political improvement and advance in the history of
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.380]   this country have always been those that have followed those periods of religious reformation
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:24.740]   and revival when the great emphasis was placed upon the individual.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.460]   You see, that's what happened in the Protestant Reformation.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.700]   Before that, it was the church, and the individual, in a sense, didn't matter.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.800]   But God deals with one man, Martin Luther, and this one individual stands up against
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.960]   that massive organization and fifteen centuries of history behind it, and he asserts what
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.600]   he has seen.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.140]   Thank God!
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.800]   That was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.440]   And you see, it was the period that followed that, the Elizabethan period, if you like,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.140]   in this country, that saw one of the greatest flowering periods in literature, apart from
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.280]   anything else, that this country's ever known.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.560]   And it was then, still more so, in the next century, as the result of the Puritan preaching,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.280]   which was always personal and experimental and pastoral.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.000]   You had the great period of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, and this again was all in terms
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.920]   of the individual and his relationship to God, but the whole of society derived benefit
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   from that.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.800]   It's the only way you can ever deal with society.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:31.080]   You start by dealing with the individual, and perhaps even more striking, who can calculate
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.960]   the full effect of the great evangelical awakening of the eighteenth century.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.280]   A secular historian, Leckie, has ventured the opinion that it was that evangelical awakening
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.720]   that saved this country from so much of the tragedy of the French Revolution.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.560]   This individual conversion, this was the thing that gave stimulus to education.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   It was the origin, in a sense, of the trades union movement, and all the things that were
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   so beneficent in the last century, they really come out of this great evangelical awakening,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.720]   with its emphasis upon individual personal salvation.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.400]   It is only as men are individually saved and reconciled to God, that they begin to realize
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.280]   their social and political responsibilities.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.480]   And you see, the tragedy today is, in an age which emphasizes the social as distinct from
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.360]   the personal, that there is less social and political consciousness and concern than perhaps
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.520]   there has ever been.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.080]   So I assert that this is always a matter that starts with the individual, "I am what I
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   am."
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.640]   Now, I want to emphasize this, not only as regards the teaching of those who are opposed
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:54.420]   to the gospel outside, I want to emphasize it for those who claim to be Christian.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.360]   What makes you a Christian, my friend, is not your opinions.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.880]   Not even your opinions about this.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.360]   You know, you can accept the whole of this intellectually and still not be a Christian.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.300]   This is personal.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.080]   You can hold the right views and you can argue for them and still not be a Christian.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.040]   There is such a thing as taking up the Christian philosophy that doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   A Christian is a man who has been changed by it.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.880]   He's had a personal experimental experience of it.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   He has a knowledge of it.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   "I am what I am," he says.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:32.200]   He doesn't say, "I hold the opinions that I do," but, "I am what I am."
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.000]   And that is ever the Christian position.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.780]   Because, you see, the Christian is concerned with this matter of, "What am I?"
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.360]   This is the thing that the world isn't forgetting.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.800]   We're all supposed to be concerned about the war in Vietnam tonight, and I suppose
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.280]   I ought to be preaching about that.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   No, no.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.080]   I could preach about the war in Vietnam, you'd get no benefit, and I would make no difference
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.920]   to the war in Vietnam, and we'd have wasted our evening.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.640]   I am concerned about you, my friend, and I'm not concerned about your opinions on Vietnam,
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.720]   South Africa, America, nor anything else.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.240]   I'm not even about this.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.760]   I'm asking you, "What are you?"
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.160]   What are you?
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.000]   What is men?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.520]   What are you making of life?
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.040]   What are you doing in this world?
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   How are you standing up to it?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.960]   Tell me how you're going to die, because you're going to.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.480]   Someone has said recently that men is the only animal that knows he's going to die.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   Very well.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   Do you know you're going to die?
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.040]   Have you solved the problem?
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   How are you going to die?
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.760]   Here's the great question.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.480]   The world was here before you came into it.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.520]   It'll be here after you've gone out of it.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.360]   The world has always had problems.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   It still has them.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   It will have them.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.400]   The question for you is, "Who are you?"
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   What are you doing here?
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   What are you making of it all?
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.240]   How are you going out of it?
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.640]   What lies beyond it?
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.400]   Let's put it in the old form, "Where will you spend eternity?"
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.960]   This is intensely personal.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.560]   If we haven't realized that it is personal, and if it doesn't mean something personal
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.120]   to us, we are not Christians.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   You see, you can be brought up religiously.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.880]   You can be brought up to go to church.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.240]   That doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   No, no.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.280]   This is something that has happened to you.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   You know it.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   It's simple.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   I am what I am.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   Very well.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.480]   There is the first thing that is emphasized by him.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.120]   But then I hurry on to his second emphasis, which is this.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:34.720]   The Christian is what he is, by the grace of God, but by the grace of God, I am what
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   I am.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:42.200]   Now, here, of course, is again one of these most vital points.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.120]   It is all of the grace of God.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.640]   This is the emphasis of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.940]   It's the emphasis of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.360]   This is the thing that saves us.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.600]   It is all God.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.860]   It's the only hope in the world tonight.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.960]   It's all us, and tonight it is the Father's plan.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.120]   The Son came into the world in order to carry it out and submit himself to the death of
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   the cross, to die for our sins, to be buried and to rise again, and thereby achieve our
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.120]   justification.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:25.320]   The Father's plan, the Son's execution, and it is the peculiar office and function
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.560]   and work of the Holy Spirit to apply what the Son has done for us and our salvation
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.520]   to us as individuals.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.080]   Well, now, we saw last Sunday night how it has been planned, and how the Son, by coming
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.440]   into the world and dying, has carried it out for us.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.760]   Now, I want to emphasize tonight that the application is again entirely a matter of
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.640]   God's action, by the grace of God, God the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   It isn't surprising that the Apostle Paul should say this, is it?
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.160]   I remind you again of his story.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.960]   Remember what we read from Acts 26.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.760]   There he is going down from Jerusalem to Damascus.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   He tells us in another account of the same thing that he was breathing out threatenings
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   and slaughter.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.720]   He hated Christ and all about him, and he was going to exterminate a little church down
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.600]   at Damascus, and he was ravished at the very thought of doing it.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.640]   And then, you see, suddenly about noonday he was apprehended and arrested, fell on his
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.000]   back to the floor and was blinded, and then saw the truth.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.080]   It's not surprising he says it is by the grace of God, does it?
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.760]   You see, he was going as far away from it as he could.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.280]   He was doing everything he could to destroy it and to send it entirely out of being.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.800]   But my dear friend, this is true of all of us.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.080]   No man becomes a Christian except by the grace of God.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.620]   I say again, we don't make ourselves Christian.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.400]   I don't care what you do.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.360]   You'll never by good deeds make yourself a Christian.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.020]   You can live the life of a paragon of all the virtues, you're still not a Christian.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.960]   You can fast and sweat and pray.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.720]   You can go to the ends of the earth and up to the heavens, you'll never make yourself
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   a Christian.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   Impossible!
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:20.560]   Neither will you ever become a Christian as the result of your intelligence and your brain
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.600]   and your logic and your understanding and all your brilliance and all your searching
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.360]   and seeking after truth and all your amazing understanding and all your modern sophistication
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   thrown in.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   Never!
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   Impossible!
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:41.880]   By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.520]   I've made no contribution to it.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.360]   I'm a Christian in spite of myself.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.880]   That's the testimony of this man.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.120]   It is the testimony of everybody who's truly Christian.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.320]   If you think you've made yourself a Christian, I tell you, you're not a Christian, you've
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.400]   never been one.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.200]   If you think your parents made you one, if you think a priest made you one, again you
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.240]   know nothing about it.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.680]   It is by the grace of God.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.240]   And that alone, this is the glory of the Christian message.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.120]   It's the great message of the Bible, that when the world had rebelled against him and
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.840]   fallen into sin and gone astray, God came down and spoke to men.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   He sought him out and spoke to him and told him what he was going to do.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:30.800]   He's God seeking men and making himself known to us and showing us the way of salvation.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.480]   Paul puts it still more explicitly in writing to the Galatians.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480]   Listen to him.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:43.600]   "When it pleased God that separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.840]   to reveal his Son in me."
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   That's how it happened.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.800]   Separated from his mother's womb when he didn't know it.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.360]   When he was a rebel, when he was a vile opponent, God had already chosen him and had separated
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.080]   him and was drawing him and was calling him.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.160]   It is all by the grace of God.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.240]   And this is true of every single Christian.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.720]   It is the only way.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.840]   I'll show you why in a moment.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.720]   "By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.840]   It is the gift of God."
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.440]   It is all of grace.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:35.680]   "Who is a pardoning God like thee, and who has grace, shall writh and free the free grace
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.440]   of God."
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.200]   You don't pay a hipney for it.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.120]   The invitation is, "Without come, without money and without price, O everyone that thirsteth,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   come ye to the waters, come, buy, eat and drink, without money, without price."
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.760]   God demands nothing of you.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.160]   And the only people he'll receive are the people who can say honestly, "Nothing in
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:05.200]   my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling."
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.400]   It is all of the grace of God.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.880]   But I want to emphasize also the power of this grace of God.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.720]   That's the astonishing thing, of course, that comes out in the case and in the story
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.440]   of this mighty Apostle Paul.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.600]   The power of the grace of God.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.200]   My dear friend, this is the only hope tonight.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.720]   It's the only hope for any individual.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920]   It's the only hope for the whole world.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.120]   It is the very central glory of the gospel.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.640]   Do you know, nothing but the powerful grace of God could ever make any one of us a Christian,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.960]   could ever save any single one of us.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.440]   Don't you see it all so plainly?
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.440]   In the case of Paul himself, what a strong man he was.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.520]   I mean by that a strong personality, with all his genius and all his brilliance and
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.360]   all his knowledge and his background.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.760]   Here was a man, you see, who felt he could stand up against the Son of God, and he did
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   so.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.320]   There is only one thing that could have broken him down, that was the grace of God.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.080]   And nothing else can ever break anybody else down.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.040]   No man can ever convert a soul.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.160]   No man can ever make another man a Christian.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.720]   It doesn't matter how eloquent he may be, however perfect his logic and his reasoning
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.880]   and his organization, or a man can influence others psychologically and get decisions out
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   of them.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.080]   I'm interested in people becoming Christian in this true sense of this personal experience
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.880]   of God.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.560]   And it is nothing but the grace of God that can do this.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.320]   You needn't take my word for it.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.040]   I have the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ for what I'm saying.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:50.560]   Do you remember the story of the men referred to as the rich young ruler?
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.600]   Here's an excellent young man, a man of knowledge and learning and understanding.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.920]   He comes to our Lord and says, "Good master, what must I do that I may inherit eternal
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   life?"
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.160]   You see, he is a very good man.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.760]   Under cross-examination, he says that he's kept all the commandments.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.640]   Well, you'd say, "Here's the very man, he's always done good, and he's intelligent, he's
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   beautiful to look at."
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.200]   Our Lord, looking at him, loved him.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.800]   He was attractive as a personality.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.960]   Here, surely, is the ideal Christian.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.080]   But you know, that's the man that went away sorrowful.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.460]   And our Lord rarely spoke to him and showed him what it means to be a Christian.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.160]   And of course, you remember, the disciples were shocked at this.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.260]   They were dumbfounded.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:40.040]   They saw this extraordinary good young man going away sorrowful.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.880]   So they said to their master, "Master, who then can be saved?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.160]   If this man isn't saved, if this man isn't a Christian, this man who's lived such an
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.240]   exemplary life and has done so much good, if he is not a Christian, who is a Christian?
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.120]   What can ever make a man a Christian?"
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   You remember the answer?
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:12.820]   With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.080]   It is only this powerful grace of God that can ever make a man a Christian.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.800]   I say it with reverence.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:27.920]   The profoundest and the most difficult task that ever confronted the Almighty God is the
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.360]   salvation of a soul.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.680]   Now, again, you see, you needn't take my word for it.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.340]   Listen to this apostle in writing to the Romans.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.760]   He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.800]   He means by that, "I'm very proud of it.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   I exult in it."
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   Why is he not ashamed?
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:49.000]   Well, he says, "It is the power of God and to salvation to everyone that believeth, to
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.040]   the Jew first and also to the Greek."
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.800]   Now remember, he was writing to the Romans, to the members of the church at Rome, and
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:05.520]   he has in his mind the emperor, the imperial palace, all the great pop officials, and also
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.920]   the servants and the slaves and the soldiers.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:13.200]   He's already said, "I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.520]   the wise and to the unwise.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.280]   So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.800]   In other words, he's saying, "I am ready to come to preach the gospel in Rome, and
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.360]   I am ready to preach it to anybody who lives in Rome.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.400]   I can preach it to the emperor.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.320]   I can preach it to the most menial servant in the stables or in the kitchens.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   I don't care.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   Give me a soul.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   Give me a man.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   Give me a human being.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.240]   I can preach to them."
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.880]   How does he dare say such a thing?
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:49.160]   Well, he tells you, "It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth,
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.200]   but nothing less than the power of God could ever do this."
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.560]   You know, Paul was never tired of saying this.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.400]   You see, he - and it's not surprising, as I say, and consider his own story - he knew
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.760]   that the only thing that could knock him down and make him cry out, "O, art thou Lord?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.600]   What wilt thou have me to do?" was nothing but an overwhelming power, and he'd experienced
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   it.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.240]   He was even writing to the Romans again in the 5th chapter.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.480]   He says, "The law entered that the offense might abound," and then he goes on, "But
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.840]   where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:30.960]   However much sin has abounded, grace has always gone beyond it and has overwhelmed it.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.840]   And as he cries out in the agony of Romans 7, "Who shall deliver me from the body of
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   this death?"
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.860]   There's only one answer, "I thank God through Jesus Christ, my Lord."
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.920]   The power of this gospel, the power of the grace of God, what it did to this man, turning
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.000]   him right round, making such a different man of him, nothing but this can ever make a man
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   a Christian.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.920]   You see, the grace of God is not merely an influence.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.640]   It isn't merely an appeal.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.480]   It doesn't appeal to us to do anything.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.880]   He doesn't merely come as a kind of beneficent and benign influence upon us.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.560]   He doesn't merely try to persuade us.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.480]   No, no, it's what he does to us.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.800]   Do you know what makes a man a Christian is that the almighty God lays his hands upon
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.040]   him and deals with him, smashes him, and then remakes him.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   Oh, Paul is always saying this.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.080]   Listen to him at the beginning of this epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.960]   He tells them that when he came among them, he determined not to know anything save Jesus
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.640]   Christ and him crucified, and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:44.200]   and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but a demonstration
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.960]   of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.920]   in the power of God.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.200]   His reliance was entirely upon the power of God.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.000]   In the second epistle to these Corinthians, he goes a step further and he says one of
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.920]   the most astounding things he ever said.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   Listen.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.400]   "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.640]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   What makes a man a Christian?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.240]   Well, he says it's something comparable to the original creation.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:30.960]   As God brought the cosmos into being out of nothing, by the word of his power he commanded,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.520]   so he has done this to me, says Paul.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, and
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.920]   the light came with such power to reveal the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.120]   in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.760]   And again he says it in that same second epistle, listen to him, he says, "Though we walk after
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.560]   the flesh, we do not war after the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.480]   but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.760]   and every vain thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.640]   into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.520]   And that's the only hope for the world tonight, in its arrogant sophistication, in its boasted
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.540]   scientific knowledge and learning and understanding, this world that is rejecting, there's only
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:29.120]   one thing that can break it down, the power of the grace of God, it can do it, praise
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   God.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:38.280]   He is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we can ask or think, according to
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.600]   the power that worketh in us.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:48.480]   It's not only the grace of God, it is the power of the grace of God.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.560]   Well very well, that brings me to the obvious next and last point, in a sense, which is
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.400]   this, isn't it?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.220]   To ask the question, what then does the grace of God do to us?
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:09.000]   And of course it's all shown us so plainly and clearly in the case of this man, and if
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.360]   it isn't true of you, you're not a Christian.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.280]   What's a Christian?
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.680]   Well I think the best definition I can give you of a Christian is this, the Christian
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:29.880]   is a man who can say, "I am, I was, I was, but I am, and I am what I am, by the grace
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   of God."
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.760]   That's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   What does it mean?
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.240]   How does this powerful grace of God bring us to this position, in which we can say,
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.320]   "I am what I am"?
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   Well I can only give you some headings, work them out for yourselves.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.820]   You know what it does?
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:34:01.600]   The first thing it does is to convict us of our utter wrongness, and convince us of our
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   sinfulness.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.800]   Don't you see it all in the case of this man?
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:14.680]   Here he is, you see, confident in his opposition to Christ, but he's entirely changed.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   What happened to him?
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.440]   Oh, the first thing was that he was convicted.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.960]   The word came to him saying, "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.800]   I don't know, there are those who say that ever since he saw the martyrdom of Stephen,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.840]   that first Christian martyr, that he was troubled, he was perplexed, he saw something in that
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.180]   man's face, for we are told in the book of Acts that Stephen's face was shining.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.160]   There was something of the glory of God in the face of this man.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.120]   There was a radiance, and Paul had never seen anything like this.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:49.400]   He was then sold of taxes, and he was troubled, and he was disturbed.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.720]   But as we will, we fight against it.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.800]   We begin to get doubts and uncertainties, but we won't give in, and we assert our opinions,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.600]   and the world will be with us, and applauding us, and on and on we go, but this thing begins
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.200]   to gnaw at us, and we have questions and querying, and doubts and uncertainties, and we are beginning
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.880]   to feel we are wrong, and we are having to prove that we are right to ourselves still
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.600]   more than to others.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.760]   And the Spirit of God goes on dealing with us, and striving with us, convicting us.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.000]   It does it through the law.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.920]   If you want the classic account of it, read the 7th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   He thought he was all right.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.800]   I was alive without the law once, but then the Spirit came upon the law, and he understood
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.160]   what the law was about.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.200]   The law revived, and I died convicted.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   The law is holy.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.480]   Well, why don't I keep it, then?
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.720]   There's something wrong with me.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.160]   I know in my mind that the law is right, but I can't keep this.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.800]   I find another law in my members.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.280]   Here he is in trouble.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   He knows that's right.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   He knows he's wrong.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.240]   This is conviction of sin.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.040]   Now you can't be a Christian without conviction of sin.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   It's impossible.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.960]   If you've never known conviction of sin—now, you needn't know it with the same intensity
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.200]   as Paul or John Bunyan and many others that you can read about in literature.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.480]   All I'm saying is this, that if you haven't been disturbed, if you haven't started questioning
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.680]   as to whether you're right, if you haven't lost confidence in your goodness and your
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.520]   understanding and your modern knowledge and sophistication, if you're not beginning to
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.720]   be worried about yourself, or have not been at some time, you're just not a Christian.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.700]   It's impossible.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.800]   This is invariable.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.640]   You get it at the very beginning of the Christian church.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.600]   Read the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and there you'll have
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:43.480]   an account of Peter preaching a sermon on the day of Pentecost, preaching about Christ,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.440]   expanding the Scriptures.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.680]   And what we are told is this, he hadn't gone very far before people began to cry out in
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:56.200]   the crowd, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   What's the matter with them?
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.020]   No, they're convicted.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.320]   You see, these people in the crowd at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost are the same people,
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.160]   many of them who'd been there a few weeks before and had been shouting out, "Away with
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   him!
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.360]   Crucify him!" about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.760]   They listened to their rulers and they cried, "We want Barabbas!
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760]   Give us Barabbas!
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   Send this one away!
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.320]   Crucify this Jesus!
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   We don't want him!"
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.240]   They said, "Even our blood be on our own heads!"
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.440]   But here they are listening to the preaching of this little man, Peter, filled with the
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.240]   Holy Spirit, and they're disturbed, they're convicted, and they cry out, "Men and brethren,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.560]   what shall we do?"
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.480]   This is conviction of sin.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.760]   Or take it in the case of the Philippian jailer later on in the book of Acts.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.280]   "Sir," he says, "what must I do to be saved?"
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.040]   He's realized his need of being saved.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.040]   He's lost his self-confidence.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.040]   He's in trouble.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   My friend, are you in trouble?
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   Have you ever been in trouble?
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   As you face your life and ask, "What is life?
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   What am I?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   What am I doing here?
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   How am I living?
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   How am I going to die?"
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.040]   Have you ever been troubled?
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   Or are you complacent and self-satisfied?
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   Of course, modern knowledge and, of course, how easy it is to attack the false religions.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   They think that's clever.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.920]   They think they can dismiss Christianity by dismissing Hinduism and Mohammedanism and
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:20.440]   Judaism and a false representation of Christianity in terms of Roman Catholicism.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   They think they've got rid of the whole thing.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.440]   Are you like that?
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.280]   Well, then, of course, you're not a Christian, and you'll go on in your present misery, and
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.960]   even after you're dead, you'll still go on just being miserable and not knowing where
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.080]   you are and bored with yourself and life and existence.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.800]   But tell me, have you been disturbed?
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.280]   Have you started asking questions?
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.560]   Have you rising doubts about your own competence and your own ability to put yourself and the
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   world right?
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.040]   Are you beginning to realize your need, that you're a pauper, that you're helpless?
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.680]   Have you been knocked down in any sense, conviction?
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.920]   That's what happened to this man.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   He was.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   He's become.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.480]   It started with conviction.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   What else?
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.260]   Well, then he goes on to repentance.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.260]   What is repentance?
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.240]   Well, repentance is, you see, that you've been so convinced and convicted now of your
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:18.280]   rebellion against God, your sinfulness against God, that you can't forgive yourself, that
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.000]   you're utterly ashamed of yourself, that you realize your unworthiness so acutely, that
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.080]   you're almost breaking your heart about it.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Listen to the way Paul puts it here.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.040]   He says, "Last of all, he was seen of me as of one born out of due time, for I am the
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.920]   least of the apostles, that I'm not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.280]   the church of God."
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.440]   He's ashamed of himself.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.800]   With the very thought of it, he's humbled and humiliated.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.760]   He's a wretched man.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   He writes to Timothy and says, "I was a blasphemer and an injurious person.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.800]   I can't understand myself.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.720]   Oh, wretched man that I am."
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   That's repentance.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.880]   Instead of having thought again, you see how terribly, utterly wrong you've been.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.960]   You've stopped defending yourself, you're condemning yourself with the publican depicted
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.860]   by our Lord in the famous parable.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.480]   You can but cry out and say, "God, have mercy upon me, a sinner.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   I don't try to understand.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   I haven't the ability.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   It won't help me.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.360]   All I know is that I'm rotten, I need forgiveness."
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.760]   Sorrow for sin, godly sorrow.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.400]   But still, you know, that doesn't make a man a Christian.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:39.200]   I have to mention the next thing, the most vital thing of all, conviction, repentance,
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.640]   then regeneration.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:49.760]   This entire change in the man, the complete change, "I am what I am, I was that, I persecuted,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.580]   but I'm no longer that, I am, there's a revolution."
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.080]   He's an entirely different person.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.920]   He's been changed in the profoundest manner conceivable.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.940]   Now this is what the Bible calls regeneration.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.940]   It calls it rebirth.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.960]   That's what our Lord said, wasn't it, to Nicodemus.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.320]   Then comes along with his clever learning and understanding, a master in Israel.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.040]   He wants to put certain questions to our Lord.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.280]   He's an interviewer, and oh, the interviewer's clever, isn't he?
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.540]   He's the man who knows.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.000]   He can put the catch questions.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   He understands.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   A good master.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.920]   I have a few questions to put to you.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.360]   He's brushed aside verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.240]   cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.620]   Born again, re-creation.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.240]   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creation.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.840]   All things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   What is this?
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.640]   Well, my dear friend, this is the profoundest thing in the universe.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.720]   I say again with reverence that this is a bigger thing than the original creation.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   Bigger.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   Yes, God merely had to say, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.320]   Ah, but before you and I could be changed and renewed and regenerated, the very Son
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.560]   of God has to leave heaven and be born as a babe, and to endure the contradiction of
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:17.120]   sinners against himself, and to be crucified and dead and buried, and rise again and ascend
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.160]   and return, and send the blessed Holy Spirit.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:26.520]   All this is necessary, but then, by this almighty re-creating power, it can happen, and it does
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.640]   happen to all who are truly Christian.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   What does it do?
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.760]   Well, I say, this is a complete change.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.740]   A Christian is not merely a man who is slightly different from what he was.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.920]   He is entirely different.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   Look at it in this man.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   Look at Saul of Tarsus.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   Look what he was.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   Look what he is.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:52.760]   And it's all the change that has resulted by the mighty working of the grace of God.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   What is this change?
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   Well, here it is.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   It is, I say, complete and entire.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   What was he?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.480]   What have we all been by nature?
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.240]   Spiritually dead.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.560]   Dead to God, dead to the things of God.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.680]   That's the condition of the world tonight.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.280]   Not interested in God.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   Means nothing.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   Gibberish.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   Nonsense.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.560]   And the more they say that, the more they proclaim their own spiritual death.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   Look what he does to the mind.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.920]   Look at the mind of the natural man.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:32.600]   Alienated from the Word, from God, from the life of God, by wicked works, darkened.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   Listen to Paul again.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.880]   Do you remember how he put it in addressing Agrippa and Festus?
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.160]   "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.400]   Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   I thought with myself.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   That's it.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   His brilliant mind.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.400]   His genius.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   His understanding.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.400]   But oh, how wrong.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   He didn't know him.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   He didn't understand him.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   That is why he opposed him and rejected him, and especially his death upon the cross.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.520]   And that he has already told these Corinthians in the second chapter, is the trouble with
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.600]   all the world, when left to itself.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   Whom none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known him, they would not have
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.480]   crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.800]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   unto him.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   But can he know them?
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.720]   For they are spiritually discerned.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   Their minds are darkened.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:28.000]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.400]   blinded the minds of them that believe not.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   That's what he was.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   That's what we all are by nature.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   Blind, darkened in the mind, failing to understand, and therefore rejecting.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.040]   What about the heart and the spirit?
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.680]   Well, I've already reminded you.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.880]   It's all of Tarsus, setting out from Jerusalem to Damascus, breathing out threatenings and
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.880]   slaughter, hatred, malice.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:59.720]   The natural mind, the carnal mind, says Paul is enmity against God, is not subject to the
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   law of God.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   Neither, indeed, can be.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   Paul is a natural man?
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   Here he is.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.360]   He's given us a bit of autobiography in the third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.360]   And this is how he puts it, "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.840]   other men thinketh he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcise the
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.440]   eighth day, the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews, as
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.200]   touching the law of Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:35.560]   which is of the law, blameless, the proud, self-satisfied, boasting, arrogant, sophisticated
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:46.440]   Pharisee, and that's your modern men, proud of his ignorance, jeering, cynical, sneering."
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:54.480]   Oh, that's the heart and the spirit of man as he is as the result of the fall, man as
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.840]   he's born by nature into this world, and his will equally for wicked works.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.800]   Not only doing these things, but glorying in them.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   If you want to know what the world is like, well read, as I've often advised you to
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.960]   read, the second half of the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, and there
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.040]   you'll have a description of your modern world, not only the immoralities, but the
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   foul perversions, and men not only doing the same, says Paul, but glorying in them that
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   do it, and boasting of it, and now they've passed an act of parliament to legitimize
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   it.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.360]   Glorying in it, it's a sign of advance and of civilization.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:40.600]   That's the will of men, or if you like, he's put it very perfectly to these Corinthians.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.120]   "Know ye not," he says, "that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.440]   Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.840]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.080]   revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God, and such were some of you,
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.680]   and such is your modern, clever, scientific, sophisticated, modern world, that laughs at
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.480]   God, and spits upon the name of Christ, and ridicules his precious blood."
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:22.760]   That's what man is by nature, and it is because that is true, I said, that nothing
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.240]   but the grace of God can ever change him, but it can, and it makes him anew, and it's
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:34.280]   a complete change, it's a regeneration, he's born again, not merely improved, titivated,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.320]   no, no, made anew from the very depths of what happens to him.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.480]   I was, but I am, and I am what I am by the grace of God.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   What am I?
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.240]   I am alive unto God.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.600]   I was dead in trespasses and sins, but reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sins,
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:56.720]   and alive unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.080]   My understanding is renewed.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:05.160]   The princes of this world didn't recognize him.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.840]   "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered the heart of men the things which
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.520]   God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them unto us by his
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   Spirit.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:23.480]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.600]   And the Christian is a man who has an understanding of these things, listen to Paul putting it
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.800]   again at the end of Galatians.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:35.440]   He says, "I went up," he says, "and I was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea,
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.800]   which were in Christ.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.400]   But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.040]   once he destroyed.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.920]   And they glorified God in me, of course, what else could have done it?"
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.600]   He's preaching the Gospel that he formerly tried to destroy.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   Why?
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.880]   Well, because he's been given an understanding of it.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:04.120]   Because he now sees the truth about himself and his utter failure, even as a Pharisee,
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.600]   that he was a miserable sinner.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.880]   He sees it all, and he sees there's only one way of salvation.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.400]   It is in this Christ whom he'd reviled and whom he'd rejected, but whom he now sees
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:22.040]   had loved him and had given himself for him, dying for his sins, rising again for his justification.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.920]   But it doesn't only change the mind, it changes the heart and the spirit and the nature.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:34.680]   The proud, boastful, self-satisfied Pharisee becomes a very humble man, then says, "Last
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:42.540]   of all, he was seen of me also, I who am the least of the apostles, that I'm not worthy
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.680]   to be called an apostle, oh, the humility of the men."
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:53.120]   Indeed, he says in writing to the Ephesians that he is less than the least of all saints.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.280]   He says again, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:08.560]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief, the chief of sinners.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.260]   From the self-righteous Pharisee, who has exceeded all others in his righteousness,
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.700]   he becomes the chief of sinners."
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.700]   What a change.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:23.620]   And he's got new desires, he's got new powers, he says, "You know, it came to me
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:29.300]   last of all, but I've been preaching it ever since, and therefore I labor it more
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.100]   abundantly than they all."
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.660]   He's back to the Pharisee, "Not at all, yet not I, but the grace of God that was
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   with me."
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:43.260]   Oh, the humility of these men, what a change, in mind and heart and in will, he's got
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.580]   new power, he's able to function, "It's the grace of God that works in me, to live
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.700]   the Christian life, to conquer temptations, to preach the gospel, whatever it is, I can
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.460]   do all things through Christ, which strengthens me."
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:07.140]   Such, my dear friends, is this complete change, this utter revolution, this rebirth, this
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:13.980]   regeneration, this new beginning, that the grace of God brings about in the souls of
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   men.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:21.140]   Very well, I leave you with a question.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:29.860]   I've already put questions, the proof, well, the fact that what I've been saying has
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.420]   happened to you, that's the thing, isn't it?
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   Has it happened to you?
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:37.460]   Well, here's the test.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:47.940]   Can you say quite honestly, "I am what I am at this moment, solely by the grace of
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.500]   God"?
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.840]   Are you amazed at yourself?
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.500]   Are you surprised at yourself?
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.860]   Are you astonished at the fact that you're a Christian?
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:07.820]   Does it come to you as something almost incredible, that this should have happened to you, I?
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:18.780]   Last of all, he was saying also of me, I'm in this, that I should be in this.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.100]   Is this possible?
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.540]   And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.820]   Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued?
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.820]   Is it possible?
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.820]   Have you ever felt that?
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.180]   If you haven't, I doubt whether you're a Christian.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:42.180]   And then further, are you filled with gratitude to God, that he could ever look upon such
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:47.900]   a wretch, such a vile being, one who deserved nothing but hell and eternal banishment out
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:54.140]   of the sight of God, that God has looked on you and by his grace laid hold upon you, dragged
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.340]   you out and made you a new man?
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:01.060]   Are you filled with gratitude to God?
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.180]   And do you give all the glory to God?
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:09.620]   Are you always careful to say, not so much I am this and that and this is what I'm doing,
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:18.300]   but do you always say, by the grace of God, I am what I am?
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.220]   Do you give him all the glory?
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.580]   The Christian must.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:29.220]   The Christian is a man who says with Paul, God forbid that I should glory, save in the
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:36.380]   cross of my Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world was crucified unto me, and I unto the
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.380]   world.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:42.860]   And my final test is this, do you praise him to everybody?
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.180]   Do you want everybody to know about him?
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.420]   Do you extol his matchless grace?
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:56.540]   Do you say from your heart with William Cowper, ere since by faith I saw the streams thy flowing
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:05.380]   wounds supply, redeeming love has been my thing and shall be, till I die and even beyond
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.340]   it, throughout eternity?
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.340]   Is that your position?
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:19.820]   Do you say with Samuel Davis, great God of wonders, all thy ways are God-like, matchless
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:30.700]   and divine, but the fair glories of thy grace more God-like and unrivaled shine?
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:43.580]   Who is a pardoning God like thee and who has grace so rich and free?
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.940]   Is that your testimony?
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.940]   Is that what comes out of your heart?
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.940]   If it is, you are a Christian, God bless you.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.380]   If it isn't, go to him, ask him to cast you down, to convict you.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:01.460]   Ask him to open your eyes and give you understanding and do this blessed recreating work in you.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:06.900]   And if you do so out of an honest and true heart, if you go and say, what must I do to
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.900]   be saved?
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:08.900]   He'll tell you.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:13.740]   Believe on the law of Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   Amen.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:22.100]   Now shall we sing that great hymn of Samuel Davis, which I've just quoted, hymn number
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:29.540]   67, great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:57.980]   Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:25.420]   Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:55.020]   Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:57:22.620]   Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:42.140]   Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, God-like and divine.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:46.060]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
