[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   What what children should be learning is what they want is
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.040]   what interests them is how to solve problems. They don't learn
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.880]   that by being institutionalized for 12 years and and bossed
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.640]   about by an authoritarian teacher who doesn't know very
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.320]   much they they just it's it's it's an insane idea.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.560]   Hey, folks, and welcome to the Lunar Society podcast. Today, I
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   have the great pleasure of talking with Sarah Fitz
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.880]   Claridge. Sarah is a writer, coach and speaker with a
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.760]   fallibilist worldview. She started a journal that became
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.880]   taking children seriously in the early 1990s after being
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.880]   surprised by the heated audience reactions that she was getting
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.680]   when talking about children. She's spoken all over the world
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   about her educational philosophy, and you can find
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.480]   transcripts of some of her talks on our website at Fitz
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.440]   Claridge.com and the link to that will also be in the
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.360]   description. So we had a very interesting conversation. I'm
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000]   broadly sympathetic with Sarah's worldview, though I do have my
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920]   differences, so I had a lot of fun playing devil's advocate,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.360]   but whether you agree with her or not, Sarah is an incredibly
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.120]   original and first principles thinker about how our society
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.200]   treats children. So without further ado, here's Sarah Fitz
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.680]   Claridge.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:26.300]   So Sarah, can you explain what taking children seriously is?
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.820]   Yes, taking children seriously is an educational philosophy
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.700]   that takes seriously the idea that human beings are fallible
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.260]   and that includes parents. So instead of interacting with our
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.620]   children coercively, we are trying to create consent with
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.340]   them. We're trying to find solutions to problems that
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.260]   don't involve coercion because coercion decides issues under
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.340]   an irrational institution. It embodies the theory that might
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.460]   makes right, which is false. So we don't do that. It's actually
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.420]   a new view of children in that the standard view of children
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.180]   is a bit like the view of women before they were emancipated or
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.700]   say black people when they were slaves in America. It's not
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.340]   that they're not people. They are people. This is the
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.860]   standard view, but they're not quite able to control their own
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.860]   lives. They need a benevolent, patriarchal parent, husband,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.660]   slave master to just make sure that nothing goes wrong for
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.620]   them. And of course, it's not that parents are trying to be
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.300]   dictators over their children. It's just that is the view that
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.380]   really the whole world has about children that they are not
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.900]   quite the same as the rest of us. They're not quite rational
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.100]   and creative and so we need to manage and control them to make
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.300]   sure that they turn out to be citizens who can be responsible
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.260]   for themselves. So I think instead that children are
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.740]   creative and rational and that they're creative and rational
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.420]   from birth. You know, we're born with human minds, not just
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.780]   animal minds, but we have this human mind as well and it just
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.500]   doesn't make sense to think in terms of rationality and
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.100]   creativity being turned on at some later stage and so it's
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.580]   there from the beginning. You know, how does a child learn
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.220]   language, a baby learn language if they're not creative and
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.740]   rational. So taking children seriously, you could say is
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.700]   non-coercive educational theory. It's about raising children in
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.380]   a way that doesn't involve coercion. Yeah, just just for
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.420]   the audience, my position currently is somewhere between
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.140]   yours and the conventional view. So hopefully you can nudge me
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.020]   closer to your view. So now one obvious counter argument is
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.620]   that you know when it came to women or other races, we view
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.100]   them, we viewed them as a different kind of thing, but
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.580]   children are literally a different kind of thing right
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.300]   like they're biologically different from adults. Doesn't
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.420]   this mean that they're entitled to different rights, perhaps
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.220]   fewer rights. That is the same circular argument that was used
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.340]   in the past about women and black people. Well, their skin
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.020]   is black. So obviously they're not the same as the rest of us.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.380]   Well, they're women. so obviously there's an there's an
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.340]   actual difference there. They're not men. They're not
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.820]   white men. It's the same circular argument. It's yeah.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.380]   doesn't make any sense and I think those two. Sorry. No go
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.140]   ahead. I think that there will come a time in the future when
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.500]   people will look back at how we view children now and they will
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.540]   be as horrified by that as how it seems to us when we look
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.500]   back at the arguments that people made in the past about
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.260]   black people and women. Yeah. No, I actually do agree with
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.900]   that, especially given how the schooling system works but now
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.980]   here's a just to continue that argument with between
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.620]   different races. These are superficial differences right
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.660]   and between different genders. They're not entirely
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.940]   superficial, but they're minimal when compared to the
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.980]   difference between you know a two-year-old and an
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.980]   eighteen-year-old like there seems to be such a difference
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.260]   in the kind of person we're talking about. It's entirely
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.540]   likely that a chimp is smarter than a two-year-old right now.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.260]   Why is a chimp not entitled to the same rights against
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.540]   No, no that's that's that's false. In the in the relevant
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.620]   sense, children of whatever age are the same because we have
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.700]   creativity and rationality. If you if you're talking about a
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.220]   baby who's just been born and knows nothing except genetic
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.620]   knowledge like an animal has genetic knowledge, but
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.740]   basically that's all they have but that child by the time the
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.220]   child is 2 years old or so the child will be speaking and
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.540]   doing many other things that a chimp or any other animal will
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.540]   never be doing and that's because of this creativity and
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.180]   rationality. You know something has happened in those 2 years
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.660]   and it's that the child has been forming inexplicit
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.980]   conjectures about what words mean about what we call
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.580]   different things and about a huge number of other things.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.660]   It's not just language obviously, whereas a chimp or
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.620]   whatever animal is doing none of those things. Yeah, so I
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.660]   think in case in case what your question is sort of suggesting
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.260]   that I'm saying leave a baby to its own devices. That's not
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.020]   what I'm saying. What I'm saying is coercion versus not
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.380]   coercion. I'm not saying that we don't assist our children.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.100]   Of course we do and we do know we do know more than a baby.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.820]   So the question is what do we do with this greater knowledge?
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:01.740]   Do we think that it justifies coercing the child or not and
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.460]   when you're coercing that is you're you're basically saying
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.300]   might makes right and it doesn't. Yeah. So I guess it
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.100]   would be useful to define coercion in this context. How
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.780]   do you think about the coercion of children? What does that
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:24.540]   mean? Well, coercion is is causing someone to do something
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.900]   or not do something against their will. Roughly speaking,
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.940]   that's that's a way of putting it. I mean there is more to it
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.700]   than that. I I think that we can look at more subtle issues
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.780]   than that, but basically you're you're talking about imposing
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:44.620]   your will on someone else against their will. So that's
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:51.420]   what I would say for coercion right. So I remember vaguely
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.660]   that chimps they did like an experiment where chimps and
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.140]   children were given like something like an IQ test, but
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.420]   it was like a very basic one and it turned out that chimps
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.540]   actually had higher working memory. So I but they obviously
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.780]   have a lower capacity to learn and you know learning requires
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.460]   creativity and we can talk about that as well. so the
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.580]   reason that children are entitled to a right against
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.380]   coercion is because of the fact that they can learn right as
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.940]   opposed to it's not just their pure intelligence. It's just
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.040]   like what they could become. It's that they are creative and
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.920]   rational beings and a chimp is not a chimp. A chimp has
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.360]   genetic knowledge, which allows a certain range of behaviors
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.680]   and things it can learn, but it's it's limited, whereas
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.920]   human creativity is not limited and that applies equally to
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   children as it does to adults. Although I mean a two-year-old
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   is limited right. It's not as if a two-year-old can do
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.320]   anything that an adult human can do. Well, why don't these
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   limits entail certain sorts of limitations on the rice that
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.680]   child has as well? Well, I would say that children actually
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.520]   are more creative and rational than adults, not less and
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.320]   especially young children. If you look at the enormous amount
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.600]   of stuff that young children learn and how difficult it is
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   for many adults to learn things. If anything, they have
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   more creativity and rationality, not less. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.160]   Although if we're going to apply that criterion, I mean
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   there are many things that adults can do that children
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.520]   can't do one of them is just having like formal verbal
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.480]   arguments about and like reasoning through different
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.040]   different possibilities. You know you can talk to an adult
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.000]   and say you know is this career choice the best career choice
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.880]   for you and you can go through reasons pros and cons. You
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.560]   really can't do that to a toddler and what people would
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.480]   say that this is the basic definition of rationality
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.440]   right like can we engage in a conversation where we're both
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.000]   able to make explicit our positions and go through the
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.080]   you know the different parts of our argument. We can't do
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   that with children. Well, actually we can, but if you
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.800]   just define rationality to exclude young children, then
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   obviously you're going to say look therefore young children
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   are irrational, but rationality means your ability to actually
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:37.640]   learn create new knowledge and so as I said, babies are
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.480]   clearly rational because they they learn language. That's
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.200]   clear evidence of rationality. Right so we'll have to come
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.360]   back to that because that's that's that's going to be a
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.680]   longer discussion. Let's talk about something we probably
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.120]   both agree on, which is the treatment of people who are
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.680]   teenagers or younger than teenagers. The impact that
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.960]   mandatory schooling has on people within this age range
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.040]   because I would say that actually people in this age
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.360]   range should have a presumption against coercion and that the
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.920]   schooling system is a real affront to their rights against
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:21.640]   coercion. Well, one thing I just want to say about that is
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.600]   if you're imagining that you can raise a child from birth
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   with a coercive top-down authoritarian dictatorship sort
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.280]   of relationship and then suddenly switch at whatever age
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.240]   you think that they become rational in your sense by that
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.440]   time, you've already wrecked your relationship with your
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:52.920]   child and I don't know how how it's going to go well. It's we
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.120]   need to start from the beginning with a view of
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.680]   children that they are rational. They are creative.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.520]   They are reasonable rather than thinking that you can just
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:11.400]   change course at some later state later stage. Yeah. So
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.600]   although is that is that true? I mean, you know, most parents
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.880]   I would say almost all parents raise their kids at least to
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.600]   a certain age as if they are inferior to them and they must
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.520]   obey them and you know most kids have a healthy relationship
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.200]   with their parents. Maybe not healthy in the way you would
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.800]   define it probably but they don't resent them in any sort
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.840]   of explicit sense, right? There's not a animosity there. I
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:42.360]   think that there is actually a lot of resentment and I'm not
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.520]   sure that I would say animosity, but I think that
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.600]   there is a lot of resentment between parents and children
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.800]   both ways and there is people are and it's and it's the
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.400]   parents as well because they have this view of children.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.680]   That is not at least as far as I'm concerned is not correct.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.480]   It does create friction and it does pit parents and child
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.360]   against each other. So it does cause problems right instead
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.200]   of solving problems. You're coercing the child and and then
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.040]   of course, sometimes parents who have this authoritarian
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.880]   mindset are also tend to be self sacrificial with their
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.840]   children like they're thinking right. I've got to do this for
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.480]   my child, but it's it's not that the child is requesting
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.040]   something and they are sacrificing in that way.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.280]   There's just a lot of with coercion tends to come self
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.040]   sacrifice and the whole thing is not rational and problem
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.960]   when problems aren't solved people. It hurts people and
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.880]   that includes the parents as well. Not just the children.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.800]   Yeah. Can you talk about what education would look like if
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.440]   you were when you're parenting somebody or when you're within
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.600]   a I guess a school like context, how should children be
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:15.880]   educated? Children should children should be supported to
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.000]   learn whatever they want to learn and how they want to
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   learn it and very few children actually would want to go to
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.320]   school. That school is such an inefficient way of learning
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.880]   anything and it's so it's so authoritarian. The whole
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.240]   structure of the school system is is this incredibly
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.520]   authoritarian structure. So I think the vast majority of
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.880]   children if not under psychological or other pressure
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.440]   to to lie would say that they definitely wouldn't choose to
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.360]   go to school. They might choose to go to some kind of formal
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.000]   education later when they have decided that they want to
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.280]   become a doctor say then obviously they're going to go
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.680]   through formal education, but it that might not happen until
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.320]   later. Yeah, and it's not mandatory in the same sense.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.360]   It's absolutely not. No. Yeah. The child gets to choose the
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.920]   school system is is I think it's a sort of throwback to the
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:31.080]   past when people were trying to turn out good factory workers.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.480]   It's you know, we're in our knowledge based society now and
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.560]   moving forward. That's not we're not looking for good
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:48.600]   factory workers who will obey and just do do the the mindless
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   task that someone is setting them. We're looking for people
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.480]   who are creative who come up with new ideas that will solve
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.680]   problems so that the world will be improved and we'll make
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:05.080]   progress and the suffering will be ended and you know. Right
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.880]   system is just dams down people's creativity. It's
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.800]   stultifying from the majority of people right. The objection
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.000]   people have to this view is even if you want people to be
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.080]   creative and come up with their own ideas, there's a certain
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.720]   base of knowledge of the need to be able to engage with
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.800]   problems on the frontier in the first place and that you need
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.240]   children are just not going to want to go through the
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.920]   preliminary steps of that are necessary to get up to that
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.880]   high level where they can get to solving their own problems
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.240]   and therefore you need to course them at a younger age to
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.000]   learn the basics so that they can eventually become creative.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.240]   The problem with this body of knowledge idea is that if
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.520]   everyone has the same body of knowledge, where are the new
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.320]   ideas going to come from if you think about it in the past
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.720]   before schools. The new ideas came from people whose history
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   was completely different from other people's history who had
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.680]   learned something for the sheer joy of learning that thing.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.640]   They didn't think. Oh, I have to do this. I have to study
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   this body of knowledge these this foundation of knowledge
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.040]   and then I'll have all the ideas I need to come up with
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.280]   something new. No, it's a new ideas are more likely to come
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.640]   from people who haven't got the same body of knowledge as
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.680]   everyone else. So II just think that's that idea is a mistake
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.400]   right and furthermore, even if that idea was true, the idea
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.720]   that the modern schooling system or anything that even
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.680]   closely resembles it gives you a useful body of knowledge in
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.640]   the first place is it's rebutted by an experience of
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.560]   just like visiting school for 1 day right. You're memorizing
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.280]   the difference between like alliteration or and assonance
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   or you know what date was this battle fought and you know
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.720]   some person is droning on and also the idea that then they
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.440]   get to decide when you can use the bathroom or when you can
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.560]   eat like somehow that this this level of coercion is necessary
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.360]   to give people just a basic foundation to be able to
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.320]   interact with the world. Yeah, that seems improbable to me.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.160]   Absolutely. I I'm 100% with you. Yeah. Yeah. So Brian
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.240]   Kaplan, who was actually my first guest on this podcast,
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   he wrote a book called the cases against education and he
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.960]   homeschools his own kids. The basic idea is that people are
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.160]   much less educated than you would expect given the 12 years
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.240]   of mandatory schooling they have, you know people don't
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.440]   know the basics about how government works, how the
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.480]   basics about math or science or anything once they leave
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.040]   college to an astonishing degree. The one thing he did
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.320]   say, though was when he homeschools his kids, the one
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.200]   thing he courses as children to learn is mathematics because
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   he has noticed that people who are in the unschooling
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.320]   movement that the children who are raised up this way, they
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.640]   seem fine in every way except for the fact that they struggle
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.320]   with even basic arithmetic and so he he supposes that children
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.480]   are just not going to want to go through the basic steps of
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.640]   math and math is actually an important subject that is
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.520]   required in many problem areas. So it's important to course
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.800]   your children to learn math. Well, for a start, I don't
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.560]   think it's true that children taken seriously don't know how
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.280]   to do arithmetic. I think that's that's ridiculous. Yeah, I
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.080]   don't know. I don't know which which unschool is he's he's
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.520]   talking about. Some of them do have some strange ideas such
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.960]   as not allowing children to learn or trying to stop them
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:53.240]   learning stuff until later. So I I don't know, but in terms of
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.880]   the mathematics idea that we must coerce our children to
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.960]   learn mathematics. Well, for a start, I disagree that most
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.400]   people need mathematics. I don't I don't think that's
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.040]   true to the extent that it is true. It's people learn it
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.960]   naturally anyway, but also I think it's it's this idea is
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.360]   patently false. If you think about it. Every new idea in
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.960]   mathematics, every discovery in the field of mathematics was
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.080]   discovered by someone who was not being coerced to to learn
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   math. It was discovered by someone who who was found
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   mathematics a joy a delight fascinating and that is that's
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.920]   how they came to discover it. And so yes, it might be the
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.560]   case that most people don't feel like that's about
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.520]   mathematics. Probably a lot of that is to do with the
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.280]   horrendous coercion in school about mathematics. It's enough
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.120]   to give anyone a lifelong aversion to it, but even apart
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.520]   from that, assume assuming that it's true that most people just
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.720]   are not into maths. Well, most people don't need maths. I I
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.320]   just don't think it's true that we have to coerce anyone to
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   learn anything. It's just not true people who haven't been
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.840]   coerced who've been taken seriously have no trouble at
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.320]   all learning whatever they need to learn when they realize
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.640]   that they need it. It's it's we don't need to go through 12
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.880]   years of torture or even you know a year or two of of
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.280]   torture at home with with home education under coercion to
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.320]   learn mathematics. That's ridiculous. I just right. I'm
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   of I'm of two minds on this. I on the one hand, I think you're
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.360]   right in the sense that I remember reading there was some
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.080]   superintendent who in in his or her district decided that
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.240]   children would not be required to learn math before the
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.080]   seventh grade and it turned out that the children who learn
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.920]   math in the seventh grade were no more behind after eighth
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.160]   grade in mathematics than the people who had been learning
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.000]   math since you know first grade. So maybe it is true that
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   you can pick it up at a later date, but I worry so you know
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.640]   there's there will always be people like you know Gauss or
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.560]   Newton who just are intrinsically motivated to learn
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.840]   math and you know maybe for them, maybe for these people
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.600]   who are going to make the advancements in our
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.640]   mathematical knowledge, they'll be able to do that without a
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.840]   course of education system. But what about the people who are
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.920]   would want to become programmers, but they realize by
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.680]   the time they become 18 that they just don't have a strong
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.720]   enough grasp on mathematical concepts to be able to take
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.920]   further steps in towards becoming an engineer or just
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   towards even balancing their budget right. I don't think
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.560]   that's true. I think that when people are pursuing their own
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:03.960]   interests, it just all happens naturally and it is in no way
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.240]   if someone wants to be a programmer or an engineer or a
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.640]   doctor and they and maybe they only suddenly realize this
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.280]   later on in their childhood, although I think in many cases
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.600]   people have this kind of drive earlier on in their childhood,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.200]   but even if it is later in their childhood, people can
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.160]   learn later. I mean, for example, not not that this is
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:34.520]   about mathematics, but Karl Popper's PhD thesis was not in
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.320]   philosophy. It was in psychology, education,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.440]   educational psychology, and yet he became one of the most
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.480]   important philosophers ever. So there is an example of someone
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.240]   who changed his direction late in his life, relatively
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.320]   speaking, and I think the same is true for math. So I just
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.640]   don't agree with Brian Kaplan about this. Alright, and I do
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.320]   agree with you that the presumption you shouldn't just
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.840]   coerce children just in case it happens to help them exactly
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.560]   like you. My position is probably a little bit milder
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.440]   than yours, but I think there should be like a very good
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.520]   reason to coerce children, not just like in case they happen
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.880]   to need this skill. Well, if there's a very good reason,
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:27.080]   surely you can persuade your child of that reason if it is a
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.400]   good reason. Right, although children are not known for
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.680]   being easily persuaded. Well, maybe that's because of the way
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.280]   that they are thwarted left and right throughout their
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.160]   childhood, and so then they don't trust the adults around
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.200]   them because how is a child who's been thwarted and coerced
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.560]   their whole childhood to know when you're saying something
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.720]   that actually is important that is actually in their interest
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.840]   rather than just another thwarting for some silly reason.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.760]   Right, so now another worry about this way of raising
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.600]   children is the view that school, teachers, people, even
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.120]   if the knowledge itself is not useful or necessary, just the
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.360]   act of just like getting instruction and following it
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.920]   that teaches people self-control, discipline,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.960]   executive function. It lets them know how to engage with
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.200]   authority and with hierarchy when they enter the real world,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.840]   so they'll know how to interact with their boss or how to, you
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.280]   know, exist within the company, within the community, and so
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.360]   on. That's ridiculous. To the extent that they will encounter
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.080]   authority, work situations, that kind of thing later on,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.960]   they can learn how to navigate that kind of thing then.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:58.600]   This idea of teaching children self-discipline by coercing
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.320]   them, by disciplining them, is an equivocation on the word
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:12.680]   discipline. It's suggesting that the self-discipline that,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:20.520]   say, a concert pianist or an MMA fighter has is the thing, that
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.400]   self-discipline is what you instill by coercing children.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.600]   That's rubbish. In the case of the Olympic athlete or the MMA
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.760]   fighter or the concert pianist, this is something that they
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.680]   live for, and it's their own passion, and so they are
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.320]   pursuing it fully, wholeheartedly. That is a
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   completely different thing from disciplining children.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.640]   Disciplining children says, "Don't pursue your passions
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.160]   wholeheartedly. You need to do what I say." So it's like the
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.280]   opposite. It's actually training children not to be able to
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.560]   follow their passions with full heart and really going for it.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.520]   Yeah, that's a good point. Now, there's a concern that why
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.360]   should we expect the passions that children have to reflect
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.800]   the actual skills and knowledge they should have to be able to
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.080]   function well in the world? People have plenty of passions,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.280]   but maybe there are certain things that children need to
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.720]   learn regardless of what their passions are, and that the child
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.160]   is not in a good place to understand what these things
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.640]   are that he or she must learn, because he or she has not been
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.920]   exposed to the world yet to know what problem situations will
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   arise. Well, if you have a non-coercive relationship with
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.840]   your children, then you can talk about these things, and you can
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.400]   express your concerns about that you need to know this because
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.480]   of this, and you can have a conversation. You can persuade
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:09.400]   by reason. If you just impose it, then the child probably is
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.280]   still not agreeing with you, and the effects of that is not
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.520]   predictable. So you might find that these little bits of
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.480]   coercion that you want to get in there because you're worried
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.640]   about some future thing that might never happen, but sort of
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:34.520]   make everything go wrong in the present, and really what matters
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.920]   is how we're living in the present. Not that we can't have
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.200]   goals and things that we think are important for the future,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.080]   and we can have those conversations, but if you're
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:50.840]   making life miserable in the present, then what you're
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.280]   teaching the child is that life is miserable, and that in life,
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.040]   you can't actually solve problems. You can't get what you
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.200]   want, so you might as well just give up. That is not conducive
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:11.400]   to anything important that the child will want to do. Doing
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.520]   something important, it doesn't help to have coercion added to
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.760]   that. It just doesn't help. It's telling the child that he
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.800]   can't trust himself, that he has to just live for the approval
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.760]   of someone else. That's not the kind of state of mind that
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:40.680]   concert pianist is in, or that Olympic athlete. That's not how
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.640]   it is. Yeah, yeah. No, that's a very good point. Now, is there
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.280]   where we can actually know the psychological impact of this
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.240]   kind of conventional way of raising children? I am skeptical
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   that it does have, on most people, it has a very traumatic
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.880]   effect, because just generally, just changing people's
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.720]   personality or the way they interact with the world, it's
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.960]   just very hard to do that. For example, there's a lot of
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.880]   literature with twin studies, where twins that are separated
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.320]   at birth and are adopted by different parents, regardless
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.440]   of how different the parents are, usually most of the
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.000]   difference, usually the twins are actually pretty similar,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.960]   even if they're raised in different households. I'm
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.760]   skeptical of the idea that raising children this way will
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.960]   make them significantly different than they would have
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.120]   been otherwise. Now, that doesn't mean that justifies the
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.280]   current treatment of children. You're not changing adults by
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.400]   coercing them. That still doesn't make the coercion of
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.920]   adults okay, but it does mean that I doubt that there's some
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.080]   sort of deep psychological harm that's done by the
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:57.400]   conventional approach. Suppose you're right that it makes no
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.560]   difference. Does that make immoral behaviour
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.440]   unobjectionable? No, just as I said, yeah. When it comes to
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.520]   adults, we're not looking at the adult and saying, "Well,
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.040]   there's no ill effect from coercing my wife. I think she
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.680]   needs to be kept under control, and you show me the studies
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   that show that there's a bad effect, so it's fine."
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.280]   Obviously, when it comes to adults, we don't use those
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:36.120]   arguments. We don't say, "Oh, the research shows that
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:45.640]   corporal punishment of children causes a problem later, and
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.880]   therefore, you probably shouldn't do it." We don't say
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.720]   that when it comes to adults. We say, "It's wrong to hit
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:02.360]   someone." Thinking about the effects is not the point. That
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.560]   is an example of this different view that we have of children,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.960]   this view of children that is, I think, a mistake.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.640]   Right. Yeah, you don't get to lock somebody up for 11 years
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.080]   in an institution and say that it's not a big deal because we
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   can't tell if there's any long-lasting effects from that.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.520]   Yeah, that's an immoral argument. You wouldn't make the
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.640]   same argument about an adult. Right. So now, how do you
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:38.920]   respond to the needs and wants of a very young child who might
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.520]   have unreasonable demands, or even a nonverbal toddler who
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.400]   it's even hard to know what the needs and desires are?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.720]   Well, for a start, I don't think it's unreasonable. As I
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.760]   said, I think that children have reason, just like we do.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:34:00.040]   So, with pre-verbal, I think that this is another example of
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   the difference in view, actually. Because most people
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.280]   have this view of babies, say, as just being unreasonable and
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   just crying and so on, they're not paying attention to the
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.400]   signals that the baby is giving. And so, the baby's
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.920]   signals are ignored, and so the baby starts really screaming.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:31.000]   And then parents do things like, "Right, I'm going to force
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.440]   the child to learn to sleep through the night by ignoring
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:41.320]   her cries." The problem with that is, number one, you're
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.640]   teaching the baby that the baby can't have an effect on the
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.840]   world, that problems are not soluble. But also, as I say,
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:57.960]   you are causing this conflict-ridden relationship to be
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.640]   created. Whereas, if you're taking your baby seriously,
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   then you're paying attention, and you are trying to make
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.360]   conjectures about what it is that the baby might be wanting
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.400]   or not wanting. And so, you're responding positively at a
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.520]   much earlier stage. And so, you don't have the screaming,
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:29.160]   you know, the sort of terrible stuff that you get in most
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.680]   homes. Like this idea of the terrible twos and temper
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.600]   tantrums, that doesn't happen if you're taking your children
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.760]   seriously. It just doesn't happen, because it's never
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:49.080]   getting to where it's that kind of a problem. You're actually
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.680]   responsive to your child.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.440]   Right. So, you have more experience with children than I
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.520]   do, so I'll defer to you there. So, I just don't have a strong
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.160]   position on how children turn out based on how they're
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.280]   raised. I guess my null hypothesis is that until I see
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.520]   the evidence that it makes a difference, or the evidence
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.440]   that the kids won't have temper tantrums if they're raised
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:20.120]   this way, it seems safe to assume that they will. But
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.920]   probably just experience in life will let me know otherwise.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:33.720]   Yeah. Why would someone end up that upset if their needs
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:40.760]   weren't being ignored at a much earlier stage? I guess you
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.880]   could ask the same thing of, okay, so let's take a person
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.560]   who is an adult but is mentally ill, right? Now, he might have
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.640]   tantrums, but you would never suggest that, or you could
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.200]   suggest that it's because, well, actually, that's just a
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.080]   response to what's going on in this world. But you could say,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.920]   well, a better explanation for what's going on is that he's
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.760]   just mentally ill, right? And there's probably some things
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.920]   that are upsetting him. The proximal cause of his tantrums
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.000]   is the fact that he's mentally ill. And you could say the same
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.480]   thing about a two-year-old. It's like, okay, so there might
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.200]   be things that are upsetting him or her, but the proximal
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   explanation is just that these are the terrible twos. Well,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:26.520]   it's not true. That's a myth that if you do raise children
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.240]   non-coercively, you will discover that that's just a
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.840]   myth. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have to find out if I mess up at some
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.000]   point. When you're paying attention to your very young
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:47.240]   child, then you're noticing, when people are not completely
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.800]   happy when there's a problem, you see it in their
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.040]   eyes. Why is the parent not noticing that there's a problem
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.320]   until the child is in a screaming, traumatized state
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.600]   on the floor? Why is that happening? Right. It doesn't
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.400]   need to happen. It just doesn't need to happen. And children
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.880]   who have experience of their needs being met and not being
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:21.480]   thwarted, they trust that their needs are going to be met.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.240]   Yeah, so I think my parents' philosophy on this was, they
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.200]   explained it to me at some point, and you'll disagree with
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.720]   this very much, but their idea was, if you respond to
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.800]   tantrums, you're teaching the child that the way you get a
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.480]   response is by throwing a tantrum. Whereas if you ignore
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.520]   the tantrums and then respond to the child when he or she is
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.920]   being more reasonable, then you're teaching the child that
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.160]   tantrums are not the way you get what you want, but that if
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.720]   you're in another mood, then that's the way you should
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.320]   interact with the world. Yeah, using dog training techniques
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.360]   on children is, I think, is just immoral. And if you think
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.800]   about it from a young child's perspective, what that is doing
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.200]   when you are shunning them, ignoring them, you're basically
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.960]   withdrawing love. And for a child, a young child, that is
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:24.200]   absolutely terrifying. So I think that if parents could put
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.440]   themselves in their young children's minds and see how it
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.040]   is for those children, I don't think that they would want to
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.440]   do that. And, you know, we are not animal. I mean, we are
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   animals, but we have a human, a human mind. So the question is
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.600]   whether you want to be training your children by dog training
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.040]   techniques, by behaviorist operant conditioning or
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.920]   classical conditioning, or whether you want to use reason.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.040]   Right. Coercion decides issues under an irrational
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.600]   institution. And so you can't get the right answer that way.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.520]   Yeah. Now, one objection that I've encountered people. Oh,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.600]   sorry. Go ahead. Carry on. Yeah. One objection people seem
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.200]   to have when I talk about these ideas. They worry that
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.800]   children in their natural state are uncurious, lazy, or not
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.440]   necessarily lazy, but just unmotivated by the kinds of
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.600]   things that would probably make them have a better life when
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   they're adults. So maybe they would probably spend all day
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.320]   like watching TV or playing video games or something like
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.120]   that. They aren't going to do the things that we would
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.680]   optimistically hope they would do with their free time if we
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   just let them non coercively spend their days. So they're
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.080]   not going to be, you know, exploring and learning and
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.480]   reading and all those things. Well, speaking as one who was
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:53.800]   raised in the standard way, not the way I'm suggesting I tried
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.840]   to do everything I could to escape from the coercion and
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.160]   the fighting and the endless stuff that was my time was, you
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   know, school and homework and ballet lessons and piano
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:13.880]   lessons and violin lessons and ballet lessons, acrobatics,
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.640]   and all the other stuff. And I would escape to my room
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.120]   whenever I could. And in my case, this was before computers
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.440]   and computer games. So in my case, it was reading. But I
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:33.160]   think it's in no way surprising if children raised in the
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.520]   standard way need an escape into things like video games.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:45.000]   Who wouldn't? It helps people to relax and calm down. And
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.200]   it's so I think that a lot of that, a lot of what you might
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.080]   see as laziness and doing something that you might think
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.920]   is mindless, although actually, I don't think it's
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.800]   mindless at all. I think it's very educational to play video
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:07.000]   games is is just needing to just calm down from all the
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.880]   stress of life in the in the coercive family and the with
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.320]   all the schooling and everything. So so there is that.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   So for a start, I don't think it's true that children. Well,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.080]   it's not true. Children left to their own. I mean, it's not
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.680]   left to their own devices, but not coerced would do nothing
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.840]   but play video games. But even if they wanted to do that.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:38.760]   I think that that might well be a positive thing. Now, it is
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.800]   possible that it could be a negative thing. It could be
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.120]   that a child has no other real options, in which case,
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:52.280]   obviously, that's a mistake. The parent is is not giving the
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.200]   child enough real options that are interesting, that are
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.320]   engage the child's interest and attention. But apart from
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.240]   that, with that caveat, I think that doing things like playing
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.000]   video games and watching television are incredibly
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.520]   educational. I mean, if you think about it, if an alien
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:18.040]   came from outer space, what would the quickest way to learn
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.000]   about our culture be? Well, it would probably be doing things
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   like watching soap operas on television rather than someone
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.120]   trying to teach them in a school situation. They would
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.880]   learn much more inexplicably from watching television than
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:39.560]   they would get from lessons about it. Right. I think people
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.040]   are mistaken about how educational these things are,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.800]   and it's completely mistaken to think that that children who
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.280]   aren't coerced are not curious. It's the it's entirely the
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.800]   opposite. Do do we not notice how Children's curiosity when
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   they're a young child seems to just disappear in their later
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.440]   childhood? Can it not be something to do with with the
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.400]   the way that they're educated and raised?
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.800]   Right. Yeah, it would be astonishing if millions of
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:17.240]   years of evolution resulted decided that the best way to
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.120]   produce a survival machine would be to have something that
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.080]   lays around for 18 the first 18 years of its life and does
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.560]   nothing right. Just like from first principles, you can
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.400]   anticipate that there's probably a reason that we spend
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.440]   the first part of our life as Children and that, you know,
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.840]   you would just expect evolution to have trained us to be
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.080]   curious and to explore because, you know, that's probably the
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.000]   reason we're children in the first place. And as far as the
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.800]   video games go, I always tell my friends when they make this
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.400]   objection that they're just gonna play video games all day.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.000]   It's like, where's the evidence that this is any worse a time
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.040]   way to spend time than going to school, right? If you just look
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.160]   at the studies on the efficacy of school, you know, they're
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.720]   wasting their time there anyways. But the fact is that
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.440]   they're getting they're suffering while they're
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.840]   spending their time there. So at least they're not suffering
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.120]   while they're playing video games, right?
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.360]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's more positive than
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.480]   that. But yes, and what what children should be learning is
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.760]   what they want is what interests them is how to solve
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.640]   problems. They don't learn that by being institutionalized for
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.520]   12 years and and bossed about by an authoritarian teacher who
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.480]   doesn't know very much. They just it's it's it's an insane
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:39.080]   idea. Yeah. Yeah. I think back to, you know, like my years in
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.160]   schooling, and it just the amount of not only wasted time
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.880]   that I was bored or, or just didn't want to be there, but
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.440]   also the opportunity cost, just the things I could have learned
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.360]   at a much younger age. Yes. Right, like this time in the
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.520]   child's. There's first of all, the fact that you know, children
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.840]   have a different sleep cycle than adults. And so you're
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.240]   they're sleep deprived. And that's probably messing them up.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.560]   Yeah, messing up their development. There's also the
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.480]   fact that you're using all their time with homework and with
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.880]   schoolwork. I think in the US, it's like average of three
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.760]   hours a day of homework. That's after eight hours of schooling.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.520]   So where's the time for the child to do the kinds of things
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.920]   that would make them grow and would help them develop? Yeah,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   as Pollyanna said in the book of the same name, when will I
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   have time to live? And that was after she'd her aunt had told
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.480]   her that she was going to be having lessons in the morning.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.160]   And when will I have time to live? Right?
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.880]   Another point of that, you know, twin studies literature.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.480]   So it actually also makes the case against the sort of
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.920]   coercion of children, right? Because if, if, you know,
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.440]   forcing your kid to take Taekwondo lessons, and then,
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.400]   you know, making them go to school and, you know, getting
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.720]   them extra tutoring and homework, if this stuff doesn't
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.120]   make a difference anyways, like why are you making your child
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.400]   suffer in this way? Yes, but of course, I think all these
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   expedient arguments and trying to make a science of it are a
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.160]   mistake, because, you know, we didn't end slavery because the
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.680]   studies said such and such. We didn't emancipate women because
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.720]   the studies said such and such. The arguments were moral and
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:31.320]   philosophical. Yeah. And I think people can get into some
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.400]   very dark territory when they start thinking that they can
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.000]   turn everything into a science that isn't science. It's
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.280]   scientism. Yeah. And then speaking of the treatment of
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.760]   women, that one question to ask is how could it be that every
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.480]   society that has ever existed has been wrong on this very
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.200]   basic moral question, right? But then the response is, you
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.640]   know, every society before the enlightenment before like 100
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.080]   years ago was very wrong on the treatment of women. So it's not
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.360]   that surprising that societies would universally get a moral
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.680]   question wrong. Now, the response is, well, at least
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.400]   there was a way there where one part of the population could
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.960]   did not have to experience the pain of another part of the
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.720]   population. And so could, you know, oppress them in this way.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.000]   But when it comes to children, we've all been children. So
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.400]   it's if we all realize the if you all experience the coercion
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.960]   and the trauma of this of the conventional way of raising
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.800]   Children, why are we not realizing that as adults? Yeah,
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.760]   with regard to how this could have evolved, you might want to
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.960]   read David Deutsch is the beginning of infinity. I think
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:49.560]   it's chapter 16, the evolution of creativity. I think that the
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.920]   interesting thing is how we how we got from a static society
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.240]   to the enlightenment and creativity and all the rest of
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.000]   it. So I think of taking children seriously as like the
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.200]   final phase of the enlightenment or maybe not the
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.440]   final phase, but it is certainly one area that we
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:19.640]   haven't applied enlightenment thinking to. So, yeah, I think
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.240]   that, as I said, I think that in time, people will look back
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.960]   on 2021 and how the people view Children and they will be as
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.600]   horrified as we are when we look back at how women were
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   viewed in the past. All right. But do you have an idea for why
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.760]   despite having been children ourselves, we still when we
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.400]   grew up to become adults, most people still adopt the same
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.880]   authoritarian authoritarian practices that they experience
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.080]   themselves and to which they presumably suffered from. Yes.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.120]   And again, this is something that is in the beginning of
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.280]   infinity by David Deutch, which is the idea of anti rational
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:05.480]   means. So whereas rational means replicate themselves with
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.840]   criticism, like criticism doesn't hurt a rational mean
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.600]   it's it's it's wonderful for a rational mean to be in a in an
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.960]   under critical scrutiny, but anti rational means disable
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:22.600]   their holders ability to criticize them. And so people
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.560]   brought up with these with in this way, in this anti
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.200]   rational way, develop the same hang ups, the same anti
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.400]   rational means that cause them to do the same thing to their
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   Children. I mean, not that it's 100 percent, you know, that you
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.160]   can if you're aware of the idea of anti rational means you can
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:50.680]   you can criticize them and and using creativity, at least to
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.440]   some extent, overcome them. And that's how we have over the
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.280]   years. Things have have liberalized somewhat for
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.240]   children, but we still have this view of children that is
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.560]   that is pre enlightenment, I think so. But yes, anti
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.120]   rational means is a is an explanation, I think, for why
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.200]   people grow up and do the same thing to their children.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.280]   Yeah, I do. Do you? Is there a way you expect the evolution of
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.440]   these ideas will go? Will it be enabled by, for example, in the
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.680]   United States and maybe elsewhere as well? There's a
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.800]   growth of something called Montessori schools, which kind
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.000]   of approximate this philosophy of Children where they can and
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   will learn just by their own curiosity. How do you expect
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.280]   this movement to grow? I think that that that the shift will
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.400]   come in a similar way to the shift that came when women were
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   emancipated. It wasn't all in one go. You know that women got
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.880]   the vote. I don't know which order things happened in,
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.320]   actually, but it didn't all happen at once and people and
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:06.120]   the idea of women in the culture changed gradually. And
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.000]   then there were certain things that happened like women got
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.960]   the vote that that did make a difference. But, for example,
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:18.920]   even in 1933, my own grandmother lost the job that she
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.800]   loved when she told her boss that she was getting married.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.920]   And she said, that's just the way it was. If you were if you
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:32.040]   were married, you couldn't you couldn't have a job. So even,
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.840]   you know, in my grandmother's lifetime, things were still
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.360]   changing quite some time after women had got the vote in
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.120]   England. So I think it's going to be a similar kind of thing.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:48.360]   I think I hope that my book might make a difference, you
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.680]   know, that because once you see once you see this view, the
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.200]   view of children is like our view of women was in the past
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.800]   and black people in the days of slavery. Once you see that you
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:08.520]   can't unsee it, you know, it's yeah, it's sort of wow. And I
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.000]   think that people are going to start to see it and then that's
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.040]   going to start making a difference and it'll just be,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.840]   you know, sort of domino effect and, and then gradually,
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.480]   children will be being taken seriously, more and more.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   So this book coming out soon?
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.080]   Well, I keep thinking it's nearly finished, but I'm I'm
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.960]   I'm doing a read another rewrite, so I'm not sure when
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.280]   it will be, but I hope not too long.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.720]   Yeah, I'm excited to read it. I'd love to have you back on
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.320]   once it's published so we can talk about it.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.360]   Absolutely love to.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.440]   Right. Oh, just a question that occurred to me while you were
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.760]   talking about the treatment of women. You know, one of the
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.480]   ways, obviously, that society coerced women and oppress them
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.800]   was they weren't allowed to work, right? Because they were
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.880]   seen as incapable of making the decision to work or to be able
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.640]   to perform well. Should we get rid of child labor laws, if the
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.440]   similar kind of coercion is also similar kinds of rights are
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   also to be expected of children?
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:16.760]   I, I suspect, and this is just a conjecture. I, although I am a
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.520]   libertarian, I'm not a utopian libertarian, I'm a Popperian
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.200]   libertarian. So I don't actually know what the future will look
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   like. But I would imagine that at some point in the future,
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:36.280]   some of these things will change. The child labor laws
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.000]   definitely do cause problems for, for example, young
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.680]   entrepreneurs. I've met someone who was a brilliant person and
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:54.040]   started a business at the age of, I think it was 11. And, and
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.440]   he had to lie about his age. And so now he's been banned from
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:04.440]   that, the particular financial, online financial service that he
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.280]   was using because he lied about his age. But, you know, those,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.280]   those laws are, are, do make it very difficult for children.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.480]   Although it's weird, because when I was a child, lots of
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.000]   children worked, not, not in full time jobs, because obviously
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.120]   they were at school, but lots of children worked a lot more
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.640]   than they do now, especially in America. So I don't know. I
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.800]   think that that will, I think that that's one of the things
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.680]   that will change. Yeah.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:37.320]   Yeah. People have this idea because, because of when child
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.880]   labor laws were banned, like the kind of dangerous jobs that
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.080]   children are doing, that that's the kind of jobs that 11 years,
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.400]   the 11 year olds would be doing if they were allowed to now,
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.640]   except, you know, just imagine the job that a 14 year old does
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.600]   when he's allowed to, like he's a clerk at H-E-B or Walmart or
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.680]   something. He would just do that, be allowed to do that at
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.920]   11. I wouldn't expect that that is far more, oh, let me just
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   connect my battery. I would expect that that's far more
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.040]   pleasing to the child than to be forced to stay in an
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.560]   institution, whereas he gets to choose to work and he gets paid
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.760]   for his labor and, you know, he has a voluntary relationship
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.600]   with his boss and so on.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:18.680]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously in the past, parents forced their
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.160]   children to work in dangerous conditions, you know, out of
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:29.400]   desperation for survival. So, you know, I, I, the people who,
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.600]   who brought in those labor laws obviously had very good
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.920]   intentions. It's just, we're in a different problem situation
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.080]   now and certainly going into the future, things, things will be
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.400]   different. So I'm sure that that will change.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.880]   Oh, and how about sexual consent laws? So age of consent
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.840]   laws? Well, at the moment, because children, because
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.840]   people have this view of children, this is problematic.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:03.560]   Those, those laws do at least try to protect children, but I
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.400]   can imagine some time in the distant future when children
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.640]   are taken just as seriously as everyone else is taken when
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:17.000]   they might also not be needed. I think that any kind of
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:23.400]   any kind of sexual relationship where there is a different, a
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.440]   differential of power and authority is going to be
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:31.480]   dangerous. And so I don't know what, what it will be like in
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.160]   the future. So I'm just speculating, but many of these
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:40.840]   laws obviously were needed to protect children and maybe
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.520]   still are in some respects, but may not in the future when
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.040]   children are taken seriously.
