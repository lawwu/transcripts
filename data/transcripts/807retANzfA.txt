[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260]   So what I want to do today the deep question I want to dive into today
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.580]   Based on this article as a starting point. It's going to be
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.400]   Why is it important to?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.120]   read books
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:26.200]   I'm Cal Newport and this is deep questions the show about living and working deeply in an increasingly
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.640]   distracted world
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.360]   I'm
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.260]   Here my deep work
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.680]   HQ joined as always by my
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.480]   producer Jesse
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.120]   Jesse I'm gonna make an announcement about something that you in particular have been working on in
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000]   recent months, which is our
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.840]   new ish website
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.000]   the deep life
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200]   calm
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.760]   So we soft launched this a couple months ago just to get used to the interface and to start populating it in content with content
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.280]   But the deep life comm is the official home among other things of this podcast
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.240]   Every episode has its own page at the deep life comm where you can listen to the episode
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.320]   Find it in all the various players
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.800]   Also any videos related to that episode to be found right there on the episodes page as well
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.320]   So that is going to be the home for this podcast the site for this podcast
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   It's also the home for all of the video that we produce. So all of the video we produce
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.440]   Related to the podcast as well as the standalone videos that we produce
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.680]   Infrequently now, but probably more frequently in the future. All of those will be housed in addition to on YouTube at Cal Newport
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.840]   Meet YouTube slash California. They'll also be housed at
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.640]   The deep life comm so if you want to watch podcast episodes watch clips from episodes watch other videos
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.540]   We've done like our weekly update videos, but you're suspicious for example of the YouTube recommendation algorithms
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.760]   Watch them at the deep life comm nice clean interface in our
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   Environment. So if you want to understand the idea behind this I mentioned this briefly
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.580]   Sort of buried in a recent episode in my answer to one of my questions
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.360]   But the reason why I've launched this separate website the deep life comm is that I'm trying to get some clarity
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.200]   between my work as an academic and writer and public intellectual where I write books and academic
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.940]   Articles and public facing articles for the New Yorker and I explore a lot of topics all roughly within this general this general
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.320]   Frame of technology and its impact on culture and society. I wanted there to be some clarity between that world and
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   The direct engagement I do with you my listeners and readers with things like this podcast like my videos on the specific goal of trying
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.440]   to cultivate a deeper life
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.900]   Because unlike other I would say other personalities that are out there where their entire existence is tied up in their direct
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.600]   Engagement with their readers or listeners. They're a a YouTube podcaster and that's it
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.080]   I have this whole other life in the world of idea
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.560]   So the way I see it is I'm a thinker who writes and thinks about a lot of things
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   I spun off this separate move at the deep life comm with the very
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.640]   Specific goal of being as I say at the top of that website the online home for the deep life movement
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.520]   So right now it's where my podcast is right now. It's where my videos are
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.640]   Conceivably in the future the deep life comm and the movement it represents could have some other voices on there as well
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   Maybe another show on there other types of video series. So anyways, that is the deep life comm is the home for the podcast
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.840]   That's we're gonna find pages for every episode. That's where you can watch videos without having to see
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.760]   YouTube
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.000]   Recommendations. Yes, that looks good. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm gonna have to just see kind of is the mastermind behind
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.080]   Keeping it humming
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.240]   But it seems like it's working great. Like we have all the episodes are in here now or something like this
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.320]   Yeah, pretty big archive. We might in the future add
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.160]   Transcripts start adding transcripts to pages as we go forward as well. We haven't done that yet
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.360]   But when we do that's where to live. Mm-hmm. Each episode has its own has its own page
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.740]   We got start producing more video though. Yeah, I like video I get suspicious about YouTube sometimes
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   So it's nice to have a place people can go
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.400]   To watch those videos if they don't want to actually be in the the YouTube universe
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.480]   Yeah, though. We're always happy to have you at YouTube youtube.com slash counterpart media. That is the YouTube page for all these
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.520]   Videos of these episodes and our clips are housed
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:40.060]   All right, so you may have noticed or you may notice if I drag a little bit in today's episode. I was sick this week
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.380]   You know
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.540]   Jesse knows this because we actually had to reschedule this taping because I was
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.020]   Too sick to do it on our the original time
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.840]   That we were going to record but being sick and this way I want to bring this up at the top of the show
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.280]   The day when I was the sickest which was on
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.600]   Wednesday
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.040]   Of this past week. I had an interesting epiphany. So I was really run down as nauseous my head hurt. I
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   Couldn't read books. I
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   Tried I couldn't concentrate. I just wanted I was like I can't follow this but I could
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   read the internet on my phone and
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.380]   I believe and this is a
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.400]   Precise quantification. I believe I read on that day and I'm looking up the number here all of the Internet
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.140]   And I said that's the right way of quantifying it, but it stuck with me for a second. My mind was run down
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.140]   I was sick. I was at a
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.080]   Fraction of my energy. I was still able to do stuff online
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.440]   I could read stuff online, but I couldn't read books and it occurred to me
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.320]   There's something different going on
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.680]   in book reading
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.120]   Something much more demanding than when I'm scrolling on my phone and this is honestly what I was doing in
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.000]   The comment section on the talk NATS comm
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.760]   Web blog which has the the best online discussion community on the Internet for the Washington Nationals baseball team
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.080]   Those are interesting guys. I could read that I could read Mark Zuckerman's articles on massin
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.140]   About you know, what was going on with Josiah Gray's delivery couldn't read even
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.040]   Relatively straightforward books. So then I came across this was on my mind. I'm starting a little bit better
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   fortuitously one of you my
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   listeners sent to my interesting account newport.com address an article that got right to the heart of this and I'm gonna bring this up on
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.280]   The screen so if you're watching
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   at youtube.com
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.600]   Cal Newport media
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.360]   This is episode 238 or if you're watching at the deep life calm this article
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   I have a here up on the screen is called success and circuit lies. How do we cultivate deep reading?
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.320]   Processes in a digital age. It's from February and it's written by Marianne Wolfe
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.560]   Marianne Wolfe used to be at Tufts now. She's moved to a new center at UCLA
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.200]   She is an expert on the neuroscience of reading in particular. She's done a lot of breakthrough research on
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.360]   Dyslexia what actually happens in the brain with dyslexia? She wrote a great public-facing book called Proust and the squid which I really recommend
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.360]   this article had in it a lot of great insights about
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.320]   why reading is a
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.920]   special or exceptional activity
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.840]   for human beings why it does something for us that other types of consumption and media doesn't and why we should be worried about losing it and
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.200]   Be eager to fight to get more of it. These points were all embedded in this article
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   So let's look at some quotes from this article
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.680]   There's a lot of different things going on here
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.200]   I pulled some quotes out of here not in their order that they appeared from the order that I think they're important
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.800]   To our discussion. So let me grab the first quote. I want to start with here. All right, here is
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   Marianne and again, I have this on the screen if you're at youtube.com slash Calum port media
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.520]   This is episode 238. All right, so let's start with this quote
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.960]   No human was born to read
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:06.900]   Literacy requires a new plastic brain circuit plasticity allows the circuit to adapt to any writing system and any medium that catches that
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.320]   Circuits reflect the mediums character characteristics, whatever they are. So we'll start with this point
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.720]   It's a big point. It was made in Proust and the squid humans aren't meant to read. It's a highly unnatural activity. We hijack
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.960]   Significant portions of our brain that were originally evolved to do other things and we retrain them to do this reading
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.480]   This reading activity that humans invented. It's a cultural innovation
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   that's relatively recent in the history of our species, but what Marianne is saying here is
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   We're reshaping our brain to this new activity. So specific the specifics of this activity matter
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.800]   So what we're reading how we're reading it what format we're reading in
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.120]   Actually can have an impact on how the brain is shaped. All right second quote. I want to read here
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.040]   This is now about let's dive into how different mediums can affect how our brain is shaped around reading
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.960]   the medium of print
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.520]   Advantages slower more attention and time requiring processes
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.080]   the digital medium by contrast
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.000]   advantages fast processes and multitasking
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.040]   Both well suited for skimming information's daily
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.600]   bombardments
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.960]   Marianne has a little interesting piece here where she says stop for a moment and think about that sentence you just read
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   Did you really read the whole sentence or did you skim and bounce around some words?
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.820]   Because as she goes on to clarify that's really how we engage with
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.280]   Words on screens and web browsers on social media, etc. We skim we jump around
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.040]   There's things called Z patterns and F patterns will read the first line the middle section
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   We our eyes jump around we feel like we're going fast, but we're missing a lot of information. So
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.880]   different types of reading digital verse physical
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.080]   requires different types of processes
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.520]   So does this matter? Well, let's see
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.060]   Here's what Marianne says to skim to inform as we do when we read on digital
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:14.360]   Is the new norm for reading what goes missing? However, our deep reading processes
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.960]   Which require a quality of attention increasingly at risk in a culture and on a medium in which constant distraction?
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.400]   bifurcates our attention these processes include
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.740]   Connecting background knowledge new information making analogies drawing inferences examining truth value
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.640]   passing over into the perspectives of other expanding our empathy and knowledge and
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.920]   integration and
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   critical analysis
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.280]   Here is the the key quote about summarizing all these things we get from reading a physical book
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.520]   Deep reading is our species bridge to insight and novel thought
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.200]   All right
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.080]   So let's think about what they're saying what what Marianne is saying here
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.920]   We have to reshape our brain to read
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.520]   if we're reading on a screen we tend to do what she calls skim to inform we jump around and
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.520]   See ideas try to get the gist of what's going on when we instead read on a physical page
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.800]   We instead are prioritizing processes that give us all of these
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000]   all of these
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.760]   Advanced human cognition behaviors as we get the analogies inferences truth value passing over perspectives empathetic putting ourselves into the shoes of others
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.600]   integration critical analysis the things that she describes as our bridge to insight and
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   novel thought as
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   Marianne wolf goes on to
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:45.240]   summarize those traits we get from physical books, but not digital to deploy these interactive processes
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:53.040]   requires nearly automatic decoding skills and purposeful attention that moves as William James once put it from
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.760]   flight to purchase for thought
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.960]   Imperceptible pauses and reading can lead to lightning speed leaps in our thoughts furthest reaches by contrast when we skim
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   we literally
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.120]   physiologically don't have time to think or
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.440]   feel
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.960]   So this is a big a big idea that's being made here
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.240]   slowly reading full sentences one after a time as we do when we look at a physical page is
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.400]   Supporting and kicking off all of these incredibly advanced deep thinking
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.560]   processes that are at the key of what makes humans human and
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.480]   It's not just being able to think clear. It's also being able to be more empathetic
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.560]   It's being able to integrate the ideas you're seeing into other ideas. What she's emphasizing here is just the ability to pause
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.000]   And just think for a moment about that sentence before you move on to the next allows you to integrate it
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.560]   Successfully to existing structures of thought therefore growing a much more sophisticated
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.320]   Understanding of the world all of this comes from the pace of reading the style of reading that happens on physical pages
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.600]   On a screen on a phone on an iPad. We don't get that we're skimming around
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.720]   And we literally physiologically don't have time to think or feel
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.840]   So we're not able to integrate the thoughts for reading
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:15.760]   We're not able to examine them successfully for truth value or understand how they fit in or challenge existing schemas
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.520]   We do not have the physiological or psychological space for empathy for the other people. So what we look for is
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.960]   Arousal
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:31.440]   Hey, this makes me mad. This makes me laugh. This makes me, you know excited about something. This makes me, you know scared
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.960]   Emotional arousal kind of captures our attention and we look for keywords about do I like this person or not?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.680]   Is this on my team do I grew this idea or not? It's a primitive engagement with information
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:48.040]   Does this affect other types of thinking so if we spend most of our time reading in a
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:55.760]   Digital screen instead of reading on a physical screen will that impact the way we think not just when we're engaging with text
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.280]   But when we're trying to do other type of thinking in other aspects of our life
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.440]   Here the article provides evidence that yes, the answer there is yes
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.960]   Marianne points towards a recent study that was published in JAMA Pediatrics
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.160]   By a group of researchers from Singapore McGill and Harvard. It looked at over 500 young children
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.080]   what they found is
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   increased screen time at a young age
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:27.360]   Was associated with weaker development of the brain regions responsible for the executive function skills that cover attention impulse
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.560]   inhibition and some aspects of memory
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.520]   So they're not getting
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.920]   the cognitive training
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:43.360]   That book reading in physical books gives you and without the training you're not developing those skills. So it's not just
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   The act of reading itself while you're reading allows you to do this deeper thinking it's cognitive strength training
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.540]   It's making those parts of your brains able to do that type of thinking better in the future
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.200]   When you're doing other cognitive activities
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.080]   Now is this just for young kids? Well, no Marianne goes on to say
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.760]   The same sentence she's referencing a sentence that summarized what I just said
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.640]   Could as easily describe the experience of older children and indeed
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.400]   adults
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.720]   So to me
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.680]   These are important points
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.480]   Reading a physical book in a slow deliberative and careful manner
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.320]   Sharpens a type of innovative empathetic creative and critical thinking that is otherwise hard for humans to access
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.200]   It requires us to literally rewire our brain to do that type of thinking and without a concerted effort
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.320]   We will not develop those skills
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:46.440]   If we avoid the slow and deliberate reading of actual physical books if we mainly consume information on screens constantly keeping up
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:52.240]   With the news on Twitter looking at what's going on in Instagram jumping around
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   highly engaging
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.400]   Websites or following links on social media even very highly educated people will do this and convince themselves. I'm really up on things
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.240]   I know what's going on
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.360]   I'm jumping back and forth between these sub stack quotes that I saw quoted in other tweets
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:13.160]   You feel like you're really engaged, but you're not doing the type of reading that supports innovative empathetic creative and critical thinking
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.600]   so what happens is the sophistication with which you understand and
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.440]   Later make sense of information is decreased and your ability to apply sophisticated thinking in other contexts is also
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.360]   atrophied
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.840]   Avoiding books is like being in ancient Sparta and avoiding doing any physical training
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:39.680]   You're going to be bad at the main activity that your civilization prioritizes for the Spartans. It was physical war for us as cognition
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.720]   You're making yourself much worse at that if you avoid physical books now if we think about this
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.800]   even more
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.480]   literally and
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.080]   We we go with this idea that wolf pushes
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:01.640]   That training our brain to do this type of innovative and empathetic and creative and critical thinking is something that's unnatural
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.560]   We have to hijack huge portions of our brain and doing this very difficult
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.240]   Unnatural activity that is sitting there and holding a codex and trying to decode the sentences that we have to do something incredibly
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.880]   unnatural again and again to train our brains to be this higher order of human if
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.160]   We're not doing that if we're substituting that time with screens
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.520]   We are in a literal sense evolving our brain backwards towards our pre literate tribal selves
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.640]   we're going backwards the type of brains we had before the advent of literacy and
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   The impact that had on the plastic formation of how our brain actually functions. I spent all day
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.500]   Last Wednesday sick on the internet and here was my just my conclusion. It's a terrible place
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.900]   Seriously, there's no empathy. The thinking is simplistic
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.460]   there is a
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.820]   Automatic knee-jerk meanness to any perceived outsiders. In other words if you're bouncing around
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.540]   Twitter and social media and sub stack fights going back and forth. It's a digital paleolithic tribe
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:09.900]   It's exactly what wolf would predict if you don't do this effort that makes us more than our what we used to be
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.500]   we're gonna go right back to what we used to be and
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.300]   When I see Twitter today or what ten years ago would have been
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.460]   Tumblr fighting with 4chan
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.020]   And before that, you know, who knows?
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.180]   What I see there is the human brain going backwards
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.060]   That it's going back to where it's comfortable. Where's my tribe? How does this make me feel?
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.180]   Who's the bad guy? I want to feel something big right now
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.860]   And when we do that we get away from
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.140]   What characterizes and distinguishes?
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.900]   Humans the modern human from any other any other animal or beast that's ever come before
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.960]   You know Aristotle identified in the Nicomachean ethics
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.820]   concentrated deep thought the ability to sit here and manipulate ideas just within our head as the essence of
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.820]   What it means to be human what separates humans are teleological
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.980]   endpoint
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:14.300]   So to voluntarily move backwards from that is something that we should be cautious of. All right, so I'm being pretty philosophical here. Let's get more concrete
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:22.540]   What is my recommendation for you know, my listeners here to the show? I think we need to think about a serious reading habit as
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.060]   an exceptional activity one that you need to isolate and
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:35.020]   Support and really prioritize in your life no matter what else you think is important in your personal definition of a deep life
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.940]   I'm increasingly convinced the serious reading of good books needs to be in there
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.660]   So I have seven suggestions. I want to give
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.220]   seven suggestions about integrating real reading
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.540]   into your life
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.180]   All right. Number one
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.900]   Always be reading
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.620]   Something challenging. I don't care if it's fiction or nonfiction, but something that's challenging
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.820]   ideas you have to grapple with characters whose psychological reality is
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.100]   Difficult or pushes you into new
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.820]   Psychological or emotional places like in fiction but challenging number two
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.380]   read real books
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.380]   Not on a phone not on an iPad
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.060]   Kindle, I think is okay
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:24.420]   We're going to get into this later with a question later in the the program with a good collection of questions coming up
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.660]   But for now, I'll just say Kindle's okay physical books are okay
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.380]   Don't read on your phone. Don't read on your iPad wolf goes into this in this article. It's where the other distractions are
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.420]   And you're gonna read in those old ways if you're trying to read on those same devices
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.420]   You're gonna read in the skim style number three
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   Read when possible and awesome awe-inspiring locations
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.460]   I don't like this mindset that reading is a take your cod liver oil
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   Type of grin and bear it ice bath type self-flagellation behavior make it awesome
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.220]   It's sunny out
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.960]   I'm gonna go to a park and sit on a bench or hike into the woods for 20 minutes and bring a book by you
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.880]   Know Thoreau read at a coffee shop in the morning or as I would occasionally do when I lived in Beacon Hill for a while
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.600]   And I was at MIT
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.760]   Go to a pub. That's it. We the British are great at this Americans are terrible at this
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.940]   The the art of being a grad student that has a book that's a little bit too hard
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.100]   but you have a Heffa wise in in a
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.640]   back corner of a pub
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:29.300]   It's great. It opens up your great. I'm excited to read this feels like the right place to be doing it
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.480]   Take your time is number four
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.500]   Take your time when you read go slow seek to understand if you're reading a complicated book
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.180]   Use secondary sources to push yourself. So read books about the book you're reading
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.160]   It'll give you things to look forward to push your understanding and you'll come back to the book and be able to come at it
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.660]   more sophisticated
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.580]   Again, I'm not a big believer of just immerse yourself in a complicated thing and and you will just grow
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.580]   No, don't just grab Ulysses
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:01.400]   Read a book about Ulysses. So you have some understanding of what was going on with modernist English literature in this point
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.520]   Why is this so important? What are you looking for?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:12.680]   Number five the quantity of books finished in the reading life is less important than the time spent actually reading
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.600]   so reading regularly
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.840]   Slowly and deliberately is what matters the quantity of books that translates to will depend on two things one
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.680]   happenstance
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.760]   The length of the books you happen to be reading and to just has your skill increases as you get better at reading
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   You might finish books faster
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.080]   six keep notes
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.160]   keep notes when you are
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.440]   Tackling an idea that's important. Maybe you've read multiple books on it start a document somewhere keep notes
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.560]   This helps you practice puts you in the mindset of I'm not just reading the sentences
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.120]   I want to actually try to extract information from these sentences. You're gonna slow down
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.720]   You're going to allow those purchase for thought that William James talked about that pause in between that allows you to say, hmm
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.400]   What was said here reminds me of what was said there and it changes the way I think about what I wrote the other day
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.600]   That's where real interesting synthesis happens. And finally
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:14.880]   The support all of this reading when it comes to your life with screens, especially phones and iPads try to reduce
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.520]   The use of screens as a default response to boredom
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.500]   That should be a plan thing. It's okay. If you say tonight, I'm gonna watch a show
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.040]   that I'm going to stream or there is a baseball game today and
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   At breakfast I am going to check on this site that site in this site to get the analysis of what happened there
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.060]   That's perfectly fine. What you want to avoid is when I'm bored whip this out. Hey
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.320]   Tick-tock algorithm or Twitter social dynamic show me some stuff that makes me feel big
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.860]   That you want to avoid you want your brain to not crave that so much
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.000]   You want your brain to be more comfortable with not having the big feelings at all moments
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So that when it comes time to do deep reading
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.120]   It doesn't complain
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.180]   All right, so that's my advice. So here's my summary here
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:08.880]   The reading life is a deep life the screen life the screen filled life can be downright primitive
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.700]   Which one do you want?
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   It's all about books Jesse
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:21.780]   So I like that deep dive because as you know, we like to do one theme on the show each week and
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.660]   So we have five questions coming up and they're all about reading. Yeah, so I'm excited about I love reading questions
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.540]   Yeah, I like it too. It's popular topic to a lot of people watch those types of videos
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.380]   They're always interested in the books you read each month
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:33.980]   Yeah
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.540]   so we got five good reading questions that I want to dive into from you my listeners before I do I want to briefly first
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.260]   mention a
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.260]   One of our favorite sponsors of the show and that is our friends over at Blinkist
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.980]   You've heard me talk about Blinkist before the Blinkist app
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:56.700]   allows you to understand the big ideas from over five thousand five hundred nonfiction books and
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.780]   podcast in
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.820]   just
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.660]   15 minutes
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.540]   You know, I'm realizing Jesse that's a little bit ambiguous as worded
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.460]   One potential reading of that is the Blinkist app will allow you to digest
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.780]   5,000 books worth of ideas in 15 minutes. See I think that's too much of a summary
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:23.700]   But that's not what it means what it means is you can select from over five thousand five hundred books and for any one of
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.580]   those books
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:32.220]   Get a 15 minute summary that you can either read or listen to while you do something else. Those summaries are called
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.260]   blinks
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.300]   If you want to adopt a reading life like we just discussed
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.980]   There is no better sidekick than Blinkist because here's what it allows you to do
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:49.740]   Triage potential books to let into your life. You say I'm interested in this topic. Here's a few books on it. Which one should I buy?
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.900]   You listen to or read the blinks on all three of them
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:59.660]   You get the big ideas and quickly you can kind of hone in. I don't this one seems like it's a blog post
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.700]   It's expanded. Oh, this one seems serious. Oh, that's the one I'm gonna buy. That's the one I'm gonna read
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.980]   So if you're a serious reader Blinkist should be your sidekick
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.340]   They also have this new feature called Blinkist connect in
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.420]   Which you get two accounts for the price of one
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.500]   So you sign up for one and you can gift an account to a friend Jesse you and I both use Blinkist
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.580]   You have volunteered for me to actually bring up allow me to bring up your Blinkist app on the screen here
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.940]   Yeah, let's look at this real quick. Let me just jump over
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.780]   to it
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.460]   So for those who are watching at youtube.com slash Cal Newport media
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.220]   I've logged into the Blinkist app here. The reason why I want to do this was just to show you
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.860]   one other thing which I
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.700]   Like about Blinkist is they have these things called collections
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:51.100]   So it will also help you discover new books. So I'm looking at some collections on the screen here. Here's one
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.140]   Friend of the show friend of mine Adam Grant Adam grants book recommendations
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:02.300]   So I'm gonna click on that and what you get here is a collection of 14 books that Adam Grant is
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.220]   Recommending so you have like from strength the strength by Arthur Brooks
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.780]   Parenting by Jean Olin wing and so on
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.300]   obviously, this is a
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.180]   Nonsense list because none of my books are in it, but
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:21.500]   The point is you can also have books recommended and so there's 14 books in this list
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.380]   Click on any one of these things get the 15-minute summary to see if you want to buy it
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:31.580]   I'm telling you if the reading life is something that you think is important and you really should Blinkist is a great sidekick

[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.220]   sponsor ExpressVPN in
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.100]   Many prior ad reads I've explained why you need a VPN
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.580]   so that your internet provider or people who are
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.480]   Sniffing your packets as they move through the air from your device to a Wi-Fi
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.860]   Access point can't tell who you were talking to on the internet with a VPN
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.300]   You have a secure connection to a VPN server that talks to the sites and services on your behalf
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.260]   There's a kind of fun extra bonus reason why you might want a VPN like ExpressVPN
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.360]   Is that if you choose to connect to a VPN server in another country?
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.500]   The websites or services you talk to think you are in that country. I
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.980]   Was messing around with this recently, for example, I watched The Office
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.080]   by logging into a ExpressVPN server in the UK and
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:08.260]   Then log it into my Netflix account because Netflix UK has the rights to The Office whereas Netflix in the US does not it's on
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.540]   Peacock so you could fill that in for all all sorts of other
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.820]   regionalized shows
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:20.320]   Thinking about you know, the show Vikings on Canadian Netflix, for example or Korean dramas
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.740]   Go to a Korean server connecting the Netflix. You can see suddenly Korean dramas that you wouldn't normally see in
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.240]   the US so that's that's a cool bonus feature you get in addition to the
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:37.460]   Security and the protection and the privacy is like hey, you can put yourself into different countries. Actually the way I use that most often I
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.700]   would say is when I am traveling overseas and
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.660]   I'm homesick and I want American Netflix. I just want to watch a show. I'm in a hotel room somewhere in Berlin
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:55.580]   Connect to a VPN server in the US go Netflix and Netflix thinks you're back in the good old US of A so VPNs are vital
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.420]   They also let you do fun things like that
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.500]   ExpressVPN is the one I use because I think it has the most servers
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.340]   I love the available bandwidth and it's very easy to use click a switch. It's on you don't even realize it's on
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.220]   So if you want all the benefits security privacy
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.700]   Benefits of VPNs as well as access to hundreds of new shows go to expressvpn.com
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.940]   Deep right now and you can get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:26.380]   That's ExpressVPN.com slash deep ExpressVPN.com slash deep to learn more
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.020]   All right, Jesse. We got now five questions from our listeners all
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.360]   Related to our central deep question about why we should read more books. These are all
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.800]   book related questions who is first
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.720]   My first question is from bookish. I
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:48.660]   Thought about buying used physical copies of all the books. I've read on Kindle that I found worthwhile, but it seems wasteful
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.860]   Would this be crazy?
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.500]   The TLDR here is no
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.260]   and before I elaborate on that, let me
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.620]   Briefly detour to address the topic. I put a pin in earlier
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.120]   Which is Kindle used to read is that the same as reading physical books when it comes to the advantage talked about by?
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.200]   Marion Wolfe, I would say almost
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.480]   completely yes
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.560]   It's pretty close and the big issue. This is what Wolf points out the big issue with reading on a phone or an iPad
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:24.760]   Is it's the same screen we do all this other distracting behavior on and that's what pushes us into these skim patterns
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.440]   Kindle we only used to read books
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.240]   And so it does not seem at least anecdotally to induce that same skimming mindset
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:41.020]   I mean the Kindle is not really even a screen in the traditional sense of let's say an iPad or a phone where you actually have
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:47.200]   Different color lights being projected from these very small pixels that form an image. That's not exactly
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.360]   It's not how a Kindle works a Kindle. It's actually electromechanical
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.320]   It uses a technology called e-ink and all it is is a grid of very small disks
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:02.560]   laid out like a grid one side is essentially white the other side is essentially black and
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.160]   There is a little wires think about it
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.640]   Like there's wires to every little one of those things and if you put a little electrical pulse to one of the disk it flips over
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.680]   So what's happening with the Kindle is when you switch your page?
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.440]   There's a pulse to all these disks which flips them over into a pattern and now what you're physically looking at these physical disks
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.980]   White on one side black on the others have all been flipped in a way that what it shows you is the page with your
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:33.320]   Text so there's no light behind it. It's not shining pixels at you. It's actually physically a
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.080]   pattern of white and black
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.440]   Physical disks that's why you shine a book light on it like anything else. It's like you're reading paper
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:49.120]   It really is like you're reading paper electricity is only used to flip those. It's not steady-state supported by electricity
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.760]   That's a little bit
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:57.380]   In the weeds, but I think it helps explain why the experience arena Kindle really can be like reading a physical book in a way
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.520]   That reading on your eye your iPhone is not. All right, let's go back to bookish this question
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   Is it crazy that if you like have a library book in your Kindle and you love it that you go and buy a copy
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.520]   Of it. No, I don't even think it needs to be a used copy
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.480]   Collect books that are important to you or you think are important
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.920]   I think that makes a lot of sense what better thing to collect you have in a single codex
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.120]   That is still the wisdom that might have come from years of effort and it had a real impact
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:32.320]   This very narrow thing that cost you twenty two dollars or eighteen dollars on Amazon has the ability
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.600]   to permanently rewire your cognitive
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:42.960]   Configuration changed the way you understand the world and live your life. I mean what's more powerful than that and you get it for $18
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.640]   Yes
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.000]   Celebrate these things if they've made a big difference in your life
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Buy a copy of a book that you think is really good have a library in that way. You're also supporting
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.360]   The construction of this art you're supporting writers who put all these efforts into it
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:05.120]   I am I'm not one of these people that thinks we should minimize our books or that having books is somehow fetishistic
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.960]   I mean, I think it is a one of the most important artifacts for the reasons
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.000]   We talked about in the deep dive that began the show
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.680]   they alone among
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.640]   All sorts of different things human produced are responsible for literally evolving
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:26.520]   The human brain allowing us to move to a higher more sophisticated creative empathetic state of being I think that's something that we can celebrate
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.960]   So yeah, buy the books bookish buy the books you like
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.840]   All right. What do got next Jesse?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:38.960]   All right. Next question is from Patrick. I'm a theology grad student. I just signed my first nonfiction book contract
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.160]   I've been using your paper research database method, but I'm worried it won't be flexible enough for a full book
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.520]   What do you use to track notes for your books?
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.800]   Well Patrick congratulations on the contract
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.000]   That's a call
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.400]   callback to early Cal Newport comm D deep what he called the paper research database method I
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.600]   remember writing this it was a an article for my blog years ago and
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   if memory serves I
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.880]   Had read an article or watched documentary about how the Pulitzer Prize winning nonfiction writer Taylor branch
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:23.840]   Collected and organized the notes for his epic three-part biography of Martin Luther King and he used a paper
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.240]   research database if again
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:32.720]   This is me pulling back pretty deeply into my memory banks. I did not refresh my memory of this article before the show
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.520]   I believe he used a Microsoft Access
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.360]   Database, that's how old this was and what he did is
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.160]   he immersed himself in
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.760]   Essentially every source about Kings life and when I say every source about Kings life
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.680]   I don't mean he read a lot of books about King. He did more than that. I don't just mean he went and read
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:58.400]   Important academic papers written about King. He did more than that. I don't mean that he went and read
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.520]   Every newspaper article that mentioned King during Kings life. He did do that, but he did more than that
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   He would actually go and say
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:13.520]   King was in this town on this day. Let me see what's in the newspaper in that town in that day
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.600]   Just so I can see what's going on. What was it like in?
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.360]   Selma in
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.080]   1954 on
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:27.840]   Tuesday April 17th, right and so to organize all these notes he put everything into a database that was all keyed by date
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.060]   Everything had a date and then he would summarize what's going on
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.480]   You would either transcribe relevant notes and what he observed from it and he just spent years and years doing this and the reason why
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.000]   He did is that when it came time to write his biographies he could say he had a timeline
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.040]   Okay, I'm at the point now where I'm talking about what happened in the summer of 1951
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.320]   He could essentially have his database spit out
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.120]   everything basically at all relevant to King in those three months in
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.840]   Chronological order and then he could immerse himself in all of that and from that be able to pull out a very nuanced
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.120]   Contextualized narrative about what King was doing not just King specific actions, but what was happening in the country at this time
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.480]   What was happening around King? So it's a really cool method
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.680]   Patrick I think that is too
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.740]   Probably too inflexible for your book unless you're writing historical nonfiction. You're gonna spend a lot of years on it
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.980]   But I can tell you what I do because I've evolved my paper note-taking
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.620]   Systems over the the books I've written, you know
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.680]   I've published seven of now in the middle of book number eight finished the first manuscript doing edits right now
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.020]   So I've done a lot of books. I have to write my books much faster than Taylor Branch
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.060]   You know
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:42.420]   I might have five months to put out one of my books because I have to fit this between other things like being a professor
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.660]   Etc, right and so in my systems I can say what I tend to prioritize is
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.820]   speed and
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:55.600]   Reducing friction. I want to be able to capture as much relevant information as possible and get to that relevant information as quickly
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:02.480]   As possible while minimizing obstacles the lower friction I have in collecting organizing and reviewing notes
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.900]   The more notes I can take and the more I can pull from when I'm trying to actually pull together my ideas
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.580]   So I can tell you for my most recent book the book I'm writing now on slow productivity
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:18.100]   I have moved to a system in which everything with one key exception about to tell you everything goes in the Scrivener
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:24.040]   So I write my my books in Scrivener, but I also keep all of my research notes in Scrivener
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.280]   A bunch of folders and documents within those folders. I have PDFs. I've dragged in there
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.920]   I have a bunch of websites
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.640]   typically what I like to do is put the URL of the web page and then copy all the text and put that in the
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.960]   Scrivener - so I don't have to go to the website again. All the information is right there
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.760]   I just have random observations of my own
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:48.440]   It's all organized in folders and the folders have subfolders and those subfolders have subfolders because it's incredibly easy to just throw stuff in there
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:53.600]   And that's where I write. So all the information is already where I write I write in Scrivener
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.780]   So everything I might need for a chapter when it comes time to write that chapter
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.600]   I've just been throwing random stuff in the folders for all sorts of chapters for months and when it comes time to write a particular
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.940]   Chapter I can just go to the folders relevant to that topic and review everything I have there. It's all right there
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:15.280]   It's like Taylor Branch saying what's everything that anyone ever wrote about King in the summer of 1954, but in this case about slow productivity
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.840]   And I have all my notes and then if I'm working on a chapter, I'll start with that build an outline
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.320]   Say I need more information here. I need a better story here
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.760]   I need to think more about that here and then I'll go get more research throw it on the Scrivener
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.560]   So I just take the notes and put them directly where they need to be
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.940]   When I'm actually going to write I don't want there to be
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.000]   Intermediaries, I don't want those notes going into other note-taking systems
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.200]   We're all done taken from those systems and pulling back into my book and that's because I write fast
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.280]   And I think the less friction I have
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.800]   The more notes I'll be able to take the deeper my writing will actually be able to be
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.360]   All right, so that's what I do it other systems could work too
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.120]   but again
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.600]   I don't think that Taylor Branch method is relevant unless you're Robert Caro or Taylor Branch or Robert Gross
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.280]   You know someone who's writing a book that they just spent the last decade on
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.160]   All right in the weeds Jesse I like this
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.880]   Are you impressed that I remembered?
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.520]   That paper research database. Yeah, I I think I got that right. I almost want to look it up now
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   I don't know how old that is
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.800]   I think I got that right. I remember writing that article
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.600]   So good for Patrick for he's an old-timer. That's good. It's been around for a while. All right, what do we got next?
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.480]   All right next questions from Sam bit. I have a strange relationship with books
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.240]   I buy a lot of them, but I can't read them after the first 10 to 12 pages
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:44.360]   I feel bored and I stop reading I can't however listen to long podcasts with full attention. How do I become a reader?
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.800]   Well Sam, but the key thing is you have an ambition to become a reader. So let's give that a checkmark
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.560]   The second thing I want to point out here is you have inadvertently provided us
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.760]   I think a really good case study of one of the big ideas from the deep dive earlier in this episode
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.700]   You can listen to long podcasts. No problem
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:11.200]   But you're having trouble with books that just emphasizes in my mind the exceptional nature of book reading when it comes to all
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.800]   cognitive
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:19.600]   Consumption activities. I mean podcasts are complicated. It's not like you can't pay attention to something you're able to focus on a podcast
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.760]   You're able to listen to me and what I'm saying. So it just goes to show you that there is a unique
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:30.400]   Complicated but ultimately essential cognitive dance that happens when you're grappling with sentences
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.360]   Written on the physical printed page. So it's a good case study that you're providing us here
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.000]   Alright, so what you need to do is train. I
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.080]   Don't want you to despair. You're not there's no such thing as I'm not a reader. I am a reader
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   There is I have trained to read or I have it and if you have it, how do you fix that you do the training?
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.480]   It's just like I wouldn't say I'm not a runner
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.560]   Because I just tried to run a 5k having never jogged in my life and then it go very well
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.240]   I would say I am NOT in shape to run a 5k
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.440]   But I'm sure if I trained within a few months I could run these on a regular basis
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   So I'm gonna give you a training regime Sam
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.160]   Then I'm gonna suggest about how you become a better reader
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.320]   All right. So we're gonna start with books that you are
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.160]   excited to read so we want to take out of the equation early on the
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.960]   boredom factor or the comfort with intellectual discomfort, so this could be
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.880]   Genre fiction. That's really exciting. You might even want to start with you know short stories. I
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:39.160]   Recently read Ted Chiang's original short story collection of sci-fi short stories. It was excellent, right?
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.120]   But that they're 20 pages each. They're really gripping, you know, whatever
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.040]   So it could be genre fiction or could be nonfiction me pragmatic nonfiction like the type of books
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.840]   I write like yeah
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.000]   I'm gonna read digital minimalism because I'm really motivated to spend less time on my phone and and so you're motivated
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.160]   I'll read atomic habits or memoirs. I'll read you know
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.080]   Goggins is memoir because I I want to get fired up or get some discipline
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.960]   So start with books you're excited to read forget about what they are right now
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.720]   It's just about time on page number two find a cool reading location or ritual. I talked about in the deep dive
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.320]   It's gonna help you here
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.760]   Go into the coffee shop 20 minutes while I finish this one cup of coffee. I'm going to the pub
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.240]   Bringing the book with me
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.680]   If you go to a pub, it has to be an English style pub and you need to wear a scarf
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:29.400]   Or an ascot you gotta use your accent and you got to use it. Actually got to come in with an ascot
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.360]   Preferably a beret if you're gonna wear a shirt, it should be striped like a French sailor
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.360]   and you need to say
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.600]   Good day barkeep
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.840]   Pint of ale
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.640]   well, I
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.280]   peruse
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.760]   my book by David Goggins
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.000]   Talk like that and they're like look this is this is like a member of the lost generation
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.280]   Essentially essentially we we have Steinbeck here. All right
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.160]   Then I'm gonna say so that's the setup
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:13.560]   Scheduled interval training five days a week. You're gonna read ten minutes at a time do that for at least two weeks
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:19.640]   Then up at the 15 minutes do that for at least two weeks up at the 20 minutes. You're giving your mind
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   Support I'm excited about the book. I have an awesome accent in a bar somewhere. Everyone just thinks I'm awesome
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.960]   You're fighting
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.240]   You're fighting, you know
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.440]   the the secretly beautiful but kind of nerdish women because they have the glasses on when you take off the glasses are actually models that are
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.680]   Just so attracted to the fact that you're clearly like a serious intellectual because you're ascot and you're reading in the pub
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.640]   You're fighting off women as you're trying to read
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   So you've given yourself you've set it all up and now you're doing a very reasonable amount of time
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.520]   Ten minutes at a time you did for two weeks. You can go up to 15 minutes
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   You're just you're pushing your mind's comfort actually reading beyond a few pages and then once you get to 40 minutes
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.280]   Stop upping your time
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.000]   Fix that as the time you're going to read four to five days a week
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.640]   And what you're gonna start upping is the complexity of your books
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:10.680]   So you get really comfortable at reading most days for 40 minutes and then you start upping the complexity
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:17.120]   Slightly harder books slightly more challenging books and you sort of push yourself up the up the ladder
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.200]   It may be a year or two of this you can get to the point where you're ready to actually tackle
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.280]   Classic books really complicated books books that require secondary sources
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:31.080]   I'm gonna read the secondary source first then I'm gonna read that I'm gonna read the book. I'm telling you one year Sam bit
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.320]   You can be a reader
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:38.480]   He's got trained now why you have to do training more training than other people as other people just inadvertently or through whatever
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.560]   Circumstance or through inclination or how they were raised just got more of this training already
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.120]   So they've already done the training
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   They grew up with a family of athletes
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:54.160]   They ran every day Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad in Austria made him do push-ups before he could get a meal
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.120]   He had an advantage by the time he got to the military and started bodybuilding. He was around it
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.200]   Okay, you didn't have Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.880]   Making you do push-ups in the cognitive realms. You got a little more training to do. It'll take you a year. You'll catch up
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   Actually, you don't want Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:17.240]   Actually his by his autobiography good fantastic you got a I listened to it, but I love that
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.760]   it's such a great autobiography, but his dad was from a generation of
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:29.040]   Austrian men who post-world war two were just depressed alcoholics. Yeah, just trying to grapple with you know
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.800]   it's not like he was a
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.280]   member of the Nazi Party or something, but they were all sort of
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.600]   Complicit and what was going on and it just was so that there's just a destroyed generation of men. So
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   advantage of Arnold Schwarzenegger
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.160]   Extra push-ups
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:51.560]   Disadvantaged depressed alcoholic sort of Nazi collaborator dad. So I I would say you could probably figure out a push-up routine on your own
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   All right, that's kind of going to
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.040]   Safari it is a really cool, but you know, I like about that book is I love his the
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.480]   fact that Schwarzenegger comes over here and weightlifting and basically becomes a millionaire before he really gets in the movies by just
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.520]   He builds he does these businesses other people don't want to do like brick Lane and stuff like this. Yeah and
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.120]   invest money in real estate and
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.160]   Not Santa Monica. Where was he investing?
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   Speech I think yeah. Yeah investing in real estate by the beach
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:27.320]   Just doing hard for a mail order business. Yeah, he like built up a fortune and then was like, oh, I'm gonna get in the movies
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.880]   That um, so your answer to Sam, but reminded me a couple of things
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:38.760]   About location. I went to the Library of Congress a couple weeks ago. My friend gave me a tour and that was like pretty inspiring
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:45.600]   Yeah, I I have it's expired. I told Jesse I have a researcher card there just because I like to go and work
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   You know where I would work when I go to the Library Congress was not the big room with the spot like the desks
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.080]   They're all in a circle. Mm-hmm, but in the like the Arts and Industry Library
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:00.760]   It's pretty cool because it has these like 1920s art deco like light fixtures and it's a cool place
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.720]   Yeah, I told Jesse that my I gotta find a way to write a book
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.920]   At some point soon that requires me to access the collection at the Library of Congress
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:15.040]   Just so I can spend days in that massive reading room and have people like bring me because if you're an academic
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   You can get a researcher card and they'll just have these awesome collection and it takes them a couple hours
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.720]   But you can basically get any book you want and they'll bring them all to you in a cart to your desk and you can work
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.040]   On it all day. And so I I need a reason to do that. The other thing I do
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.440]   Thanks to you is I put on my weekly plan every week just
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.960]   Some of the stuff I want to get through because I get a lot of magazines and I have different books
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.960]   I was you look at it reading on your weekly plan
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.320]   Yeah specific and then I like if I have like a pile of New Yorkers. I'll just yeah, I get through a
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.960]   couple of them so you might put like
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.400]   Thursday Thursday afternoon. I'm gonna like do some New Yorker reading. Yeah
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.000]   Yeah, I put like what I want on then when I do my daily plan. I just put it in there
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.080]   I'm gonna read this that's nice. You have you have a queue of what you want to read that week
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.040]   Yeah, when you have when you're doing a plan keep track of it and I'd forget about certain things
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.680]   So now I just kind of I like that strategy
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.900]   So it's like here's my reading queue for the week and when you're doing a daily plan
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.600]   You're used to putting aside time for reading
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.800]   But now you could actually pull something from that queue and say this specifically is what I'm gonna read
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   Yeah, it's been working out
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.240]   Yeah
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.680]   and the other thing that I do too is especially after going to Library Congress and you know,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:29.060]   Looking online stuff. It's like he's got to be comfortable knowing that you're never gonna read everything like there's so much stuff
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:34.220]   And just get through what you can just kind of what you talk about. It's slow and I'm surprised by how often
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:39.240]   I'm a big library guy. We're gonna personal library person and the next question is gonna get at this
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.520]   I'm surprised by how often I'll get a book
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:46.960]   Like I just finished a book last night that I originally bought
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.280]   Five years ago
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   But I kept it in my library like this
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.320]   It's like it's a book I want to read
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.880]   You know, but sometimes you have to wait till you're in the right mood and it took five years
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:02.900]   Mm-hmm. I read it. I finished it last night. Yeah, you know, and I'm surprised by how often that this way
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:08.300]   I love libraries how often that'll happen, you know, sometimes I'll buy a book like I'm not gonna read this right now
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.240]   But I want to own this I think I'm gonna read this
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.980]   I think it's important thing to have I get to these things and it can take me years, but I
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.860]   cycle back to things
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:22.660]   All right, speaking of libraries, we have a good library question. Let's do this next one. All right. Next question is from Quran
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.040]   I'm becoming more of an avid reader. Thanks to gal. How should I build my library?
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.720]   All right. Well, I'm a big fan of as I just talked about libraries
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.700]   My current library setup just so we can calibrate
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:40.820]   So now we're down to we have we have one full bookshelf here in the HQ
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:47.460]   Then in my study at home, the whole room is built in bookshelves now on one one half of the room
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:53.360]   It's all kids book. We have a really great collection of kids books of various readers age and then all the other shelves are
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.600]   Adult books and then in our living room. We also have a full wall of built-in bookshelves
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:07.360]   I sort of have you know, kind of three major libraries. So a big fan of personal libraries. How do you start one from scratch?
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.080]   Well, all right. I have a method
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.560]   Here's my here is my method you start with a single bookshelf and you start filling that bookshelf somewhat haphazardly
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.560]   You know you buy books that are interesting you go to use book sales. Let me try this books
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.940]   You want to read right away books you want to get to at some other point if you live in a town like I do
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.200]   With a lot of little free libraries. Hey, this book looks interesting. I'm gonna
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.360]   Grab it from there, right?
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.280]   So you're kind of filling this bookshelf with books you bought books you've read books. You might want to read some
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.480]   Really good and some you're like, I don't know so much about this
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.140]   Once the book is the bookshelf is full
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.840]   Then for a while what you do is to replacement rule
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.900]   When you get a new book you say I have to make room for this on the bookshelf
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:56.840]   So let me take off whatever sort of very low on my ranking of books on here. What's a book?
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.640]   This is probably my least favorite book that's on here. This is kind of dumb
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.040]   Replace the replace that with the new books. You're replacing sort of worst book with new book
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.000]   You do this for a while. So now you're kind of cycling through
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.640]   the same bookshelf that bookshelves quality on
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.060]   Average begins to increase and after a while most of this books on these bookshelves are pretty good
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:25.360]   I mean they've survived this calling for a long time most of the stuff that was you know
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.040]   Here's this random book on quilting that I you know
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.680]   Got at a yard sale and I never really did that stuff is gone and now your bookshelf is pretty good
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.160]   Then you can buy a second bookshelf
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:40.000]   And you can start kind of doing that same process over there and you do that until you have the number of shelves you think
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.760]   Is appropriate for where you live and your interest and how you feel about books?
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:49.200]   I'm a big fan of that bill then replace for a while to get the average quality up and wait till a shelf is of high
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   quality before you actually
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.920]   Move on to get a new shelf. I mean, there's a whole art to
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.880]   Library tending and I would say
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.020]   Jesse of the personal libraries we've seen or looked at at the show
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:06.160]   Probably our man Ryan holiday wins. He's got a lot of books. He's got a lot of books
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:12.440]   He's got a lot it helps to be so Ryan and I have the advantages of writers we get sent a lot of books
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.760]   Which is great
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:20.320]   And I buy a lot of books because I feel like it's important for my job. Yeah, but still he has a lot of books
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.760]   I have a lot of books. He has a lot of books. So I had a bookstore
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.120]   Yeah, eventually had to get a to get a bookstore. Hey
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   Bookstore is supposedly coming to come to park. Really? Yeah, are you involved?
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.480]   I don't I don't they're they're new to the town
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.040]   Having coffee with him. Oh, he's gonna or he or she is gonna love you. Yeah, it's a family
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.840]   Yeah, if kids so, I don't know I just was like look I want to I want to meet these people
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.040]   Yeah, just like give us just give a sustained round of applause
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.680]   And I'm excited about the idea of having you'll be a good customer. Yeah
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.880]   Yeah, I'll be there all the time what I'm gonna tell them is
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.120]   I'm gonna do like three or four days a week
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.000]   multi-hour long signings
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:09.640]   Like just usually not going to be people there coming to see me because I'm gonna be there something like 15 20 hours a week
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.800]   I'm just gonna show up a lot randomly and just like have a have a book. It's gonna be like and this is
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.160]   sad, that's not sad, but there's
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.960]   one of our favorite museums is the the air and space museum out by Dulles and
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:30.480]   It's I think it's cool that they allow people who have published books about their experience and usually like military
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.520]   Deviation come and like sign books or whatever, but they don't really promote anything
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.920]   They just like have them on a table sort of over by the bar
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.680]   And they so they're always just sort of there and I always feel sort of bad about it because as an author you really are
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.720]   Empathetic to unpromoted book signings. It's the worst. It's nothing worse
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.360]   We've all had it you're on book tour and like three people show up or whatever
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:56.080]   But anyways, I'm gonna lean into that just unsolicited. That's good news. Yeah. Yeah, so I hope that works out
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.680]   Real and we'll be able to around the corner from here
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   You great
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:09.120]   All right libraries, all right, let's do a let's do one more question we got time it sounds good next questions from Sarah
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.760]   Would Cal like to comment on this quote from saying Sam Bank been freed. I'm very skeptical of books
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:20.160]   I don't want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.720]   I think that if you wrote a book you f'd up and it should not have been a sick and it should have been a
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.240]   six-paragraph blog post
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.120]   well
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.320]   If you don't know who Sam Bankman freed is look it up and I think this question will make more sense
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:44.080]   Sarah here's my answer. Let's look at the state of my life today in the state of Sam Bankman Freed's life today
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:50.840]   someone who prioritizes the creativity innovation empathy and critical thinking that is
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.520]   Developed by reading and someone who prefers six-paragraph blog post
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.120]   Where would you rather be?
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.120]   Whose life would you rather have right now?
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.200]   I'll leave it there and rest my case
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.120]   Have you seen pictures of Sam Bankman freed
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:12.800]   Recently or yeah, I want to look at him for book advice. I want to look at him for fashion advice either
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.360]   I'm doing a panel in San Francisco later this spring and we were talking with some of the other panel members and
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.800]   We were joking of like so we so it's a dress code Sam Bankman freed because you do these panels with
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   There's a picture of him doing a panel with former president Bill Clinton and he's wearing shorts
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.320]   Cargo shorts flip-flops and a t-shirt. He was like that in the commercials, too
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:42.620]   Yeah, but his parents professors, right? Yeah lawyers law professors. So you think you must have read at some point? Yeah, I mean, he's obviously a
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.600]   Intelligent person. I mean went to MIT and everything. I just think his
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.320]   Yeah, got a little that brain got shook up somewhere
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.360]   Something done broke. I think it's because he didn't read enough
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.200]   He's a PSA. This is your brain. It's a PSA
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.320]   This is your brain not on books and then there's like a quick montage of Sam Bankman free
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.400]   And then like this is your brain on books and it's me at a table
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.920]   All by myself in the new bookstore in Tacoma Park
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.000]   with an ascot and a striped shirt
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.880]   Drinking a beer use your English and your French accent mixed together. Yeah. Yeah flexing furiously. He's got him both got him both
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.280]   Well, they're both intellectual people. All right enough of that nonsense
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.800]   All right
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.280]   So what I like to do in the third
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:33.000]   Act of the show is shift away from our main question and talk about some interesting things that readers have sent me
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.120]   Before we do let me mention a another sponsor that made this show possible
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.800]   This may be our very first sponsor
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.420]   I got to go back and confirm that like from way back in the pre Jesse days, but that is our good friends at grammarly
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:53.460]   The feature I have been messing around with with grammarly that I am most impressed by is grammarly premiums
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.960]   advanced tone
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:02.820]   Suggestions. This is why this is so important in a knowledge work world and especially in an increasingly
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:07.320]   remote knowledge work world where more communication is textual
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:11.820]   emails chat under the zoom window slack communication
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.320]   The quality clarity of your writing plays a big difference
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:21.020]   Now I actually think there's an opportunity embedded in this evolution of our office landscape
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.840]   There's a lot of issues I have with the shift towards everything being textual communication
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.600]   But there is one opportunity for you the lister of the show
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:34.000]   Which means if you get really good at clear textual communication you get the sudden competitive advantage over everyone else
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.760]   You come across as more confident and smarter and more on the ball just because you're writing better
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:45.560]   So there's no other time in the history of the world of business where clear communication clear written communication is more important
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:52.320]   And grammarly premium and a particular grammarly premiums advanced tone detector can help you get there faster
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.280]   So I have a couple examples. I want to tell you here Jesse
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.920]   of
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   the tone detector in
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:04.960]   Work. All right. So some real sentences here real corrections from the tone detector. So one thing it can do is
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:10.800]   Help you with confidence in your communication. So here's a real sentence
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.920]   We may want to consider providing an update
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:20.760]   Here's the suggestion from the tone detector for increasing confidence. We should consider providing an update
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:27.020]   Seems like a small change, but you come across more confident in that email in that slack makes a big difference
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.680]   All right. Here's another thing the advanced tone detector does
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.160]   reframe
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.200]   Negativity. So here's something you might write. Yeah, this marketing strategy isn't right
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.720]   Just throw that in a slack message, but that's going to come across as negative people might feel attacked
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:47.160]   Here's an actual suggested correction from the tone detector for that sentence. The marketing strategy needs to be different
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.880]   Small change makes a huge difference in the impact on the reader
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:58.120]   There's obviously a lot of other things you get with the grammarly product from even just the basic fixing your broken grammar
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.600]   To these much more advanced tone suggestions and sentence rewrites
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.960]   But anyway, it's it's like having a personal editor who sits there and helps you be a better
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960]   communicator
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.600]   The right tone can move any project forward when you get it just right with grammarly
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:19.840]   So go to grammarly.com slash tone t o n e to download and learn about grammarly premiums advanced tone suggestions. That's g r a
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:27.600]   M m a r l y dot com slash tone. Let's also talk about our friends at my body tutor
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:35.080]   If you want to get in better shape if you want to get healthier, the problem is not information
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   You know how to do it
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.920]   The problem is actually accountability. How do you actually get motivated?
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:48.000]   To continually take that action. This is where my body tutor enters the picture
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   It's a 100% online coaching program. It connects you with a
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.560]   Dedicated online coach they work with you the specific circumstances of your life
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.760]   right
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:08.000]   Are you and I'm just being hypothetical here a 40 year old male with three three kids ten or under who are sick all the
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.520]   Time and have seven jobs. The workout plan is going to be different
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.480]   Then if you are 22 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:21.120]   On the bodybuilding circuit in Venice, California, you know in the 1970s, so they build a plan that makes sense
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.640]   Here's let's think about your eating. Let's think about your exercising that makes sense for you and then
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.600]   It's a big magic you check in every day
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.280]   You do it an app. It's real easy
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.520]   You say here's what I did. So I ate here's I worked out. Here's any questions I have they give you feedback
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.760]   And that's where you get the consistency. That's what makes it work
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:45.680]   It's like having the dedicated dietitian and trainers that the actors get to train for Marvel superhero movies
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.240]   But without having that huge expense of having to pay people to come to your house because it's all on
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.080]   line
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.480]   Adam and his coaches at my body tutor are the best in the world at delivering highly personal accountability and coaching
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.840]   So if you're serious about getting fit Adam will give you $50 off your first month if you mention deep questions when you sign up
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.240]   So when you sign up you just mention deep questions, and they'll give you $50 off
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.920]   So my body tutor tutor comm mentioned deep questions and get $50 off
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:22.200]   All right final segment of the show something interesting. I usually just talk about one interesting thing that listeners sent me today Jesse
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   I'm gonna do three
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.400]   Going crazy today like it. Yeah
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.080]   Number one, this is visual. Hold on. I'm gonna grab something here from the ground
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.680]   So if you're not watching
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   youtube.com slash calendar port media or at the deep life comm
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:43.420]   You're missing out here. It's the end of an era Jesse. I have has been made fun of for months now
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.960]   After I revealed on one of our weekly update videos the state of my computer keyboard
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.360]   Because you may not know this about me. I write a whole bunch
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:59.160]   I had worn away all of the keys on my keyboard from just hitting them too much only the like Q and the Z keys actually
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.360]   Still remained
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.400]   All right. Here we go. Jesse. Oh, wow end of an era
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.920]   Completely clean keys that comes off real easily, right?
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:15.680]   So what it is is just a little just a little silicon thing. So let's show them the ones. Yeah. Look at that
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.280]   So I can actually see the keys I'm off the touch type all the time
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:28.520]   Advantage and I do like Apple products, but the new MacBook airs is the 2018-19 models. The keys were too low. I
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.040]   Really care about the tactile feel of keys
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.540]   I write for a living and they got too low like your keys are a little on that dealt. They're a little bit higher
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.560]   Yeah, that's a much better experience
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.400]   Adding the silicon cover to my keys gives me an extra little eighth of an inch and you have a little bit more
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.920]   Carry on each press. I like it better. So your next computer is it gonna be a Mac or is it gonna be?
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.120]   Yeah, I like the Mac ecosystem, but I this is whoever's in charge of this now
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.620]   You got to work with writers when you build your keys on the keyboard the they can't be too low
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:05.040]   We got it. We need some spring. You need the fingers to do a little effort and the pound up a little bit
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.720]   So I'm simulating that with the gives you momentum gives you momentum
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.600]   I'm a fast writer when I get I mean I fast hyper as you might imagine so I need momentum
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.280]   All right. So the second thing is a quote
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.400]   That was sent to me the interesting that Cal Newport comm email address
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:30.040]   This is from a TI L reddit forum in a previous episode readers told me that stands for today. I learned
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.000]   so TI L
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.760]   What TI L means is that recursive? Anyways, here was a quote from that forum
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.200]   Napoleon Bonaparte
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   Refused to open his mail for three weeks
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.520]   By that time most of the issues raised in letters had resolved themselves and no longer retired his attention. I
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.000]   Like this strategy
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.120]   Just ignore your email until people
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:59.560]   Yeah moved on in anger. The only issue is it helps not it necessary
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.880]   But if you can arrange this it helps for the strategy to be the Emperor of Europe
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:10.840]   It's a little bit harder if you are not the Emperor of Europe to do the strategy, but still a good one
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.520]   Alright, the third interesting thing I want to talk about is an article
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.320]   that was sent in from a
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.120]   product management website now this article is
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.560]   This is a technical I'm not going to get lost in the technical details
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:30.760]   What I care about here is a big picture idea that I think is relevant to slow productivity
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.760]   So if you're watching this on the screen
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.440]   You will see the title of this article. I have up here right now is called
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.080]   Stop obsessing over development velocity
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.160]   focus on
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.600]   this instead and so if you read this whole article
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:54.120]   It's talking about software development and it says there is an issue of software development to focus on the velocity of
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.680]   features getting completed
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.200]   How many features do we complete and add to the product this month or this week and it's this?
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.760]   Endless hurry up cycle to push more and more of those features
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.560]   This article makes the argument that that's not necessarily the way to maximize the value you produce
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.400]   so here's a few points this is actually the summary that the listener sent me along with this article and
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.600]   Software most new features don't make a positive impact for users because of that
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.680]   Increasing the velocity that is the number of features you ship per unit of time can create more waste
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.560]   If you obsess instead over making a positive impact
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.920]   You deliver more value with fewer features
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.880]   and
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:44.600]   Because existing features good or bad slow down the development of new features due to code complexity and the maintenance requirements and supporting them the positive effect
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:50.640]   Of building fewer but better features compounds as time goes on. I think there's a cool idea there
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.040]   It is relevant well beyond just software
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.440]   development
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.240]   focusing on a
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.560]   Smaller number of things that are clearly very important and high impact and doing them very well in
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:09.960]   Many different areas can end up producing more value and therefore more success economically
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.760]   Then just trying to do as many things
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:20.000]   This approach of course falls out of the three big principles of slow productivity do fewer things working at a natural pace
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.600]   Obsessing over quality. So looking at impact over velocity is exactly the type of strategy
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:32.060]   You might adopt if you are a believer in those three principles and I can imagine this in so many different areas. I mean think about
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   academic service
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.080]   Instead of saying like how many different issues can we get through as a faculty during this semester in our faculty meetings?
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.720]   It might be let's really take our time to figure out. What's the biggest thing we could do
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.600]   Let's do that. Well and take our time and do it really well, you know, you're probably gonna end up better
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.840]   You imagine working on client service
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.160]   Let's try to do this one thing really well really change that clients business as opposed to like look at how many things we responded
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:04.440]   To and and got back to him on I could imagine this impact verse velocity trade-off happening in a lot of different areas
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.360]   I love that mindset
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.760]   And so I love this way of thinking so I wanted to highlight that this article is by
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:17.080]   Itamar Gillad, so good for you smart ideas if you're software developer
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.800]   Follow the link in the show notes so you can get lost in the weeds here. But for everyone else, let's just like this idea
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.480]   Velocity is not always the key
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.640]   to producing more value
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.680]   All right, everyone so that's all the time we have for today
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:37.320]   You can now shut down your podcast player and go read a real book
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:45.240]   We will be back next week with another episode of the deep questions podcast and until then as always stay deep
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960]   *outro music*
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.000]   (upbeat music)
