[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   And I think like two months into it,
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.780]   we added like a little over 3 million ARR in like three,
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.860]   a three day period.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860]   I went and got us like new product and it was just, I mean,
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.580]   I was just like hyperventilated like, Oh my God,
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.060]   like I cannot believe this. I've stood my whole life failing.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.220]   And you finally kind of hit one. So no, man, I think we're, uh,
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.220]   I am just as, as shocked and grateful to kind of be a part of this as a,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.260]   as you know, the next person. And you know, I think, I think, yeah,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.740]   it's been a wild ride and we're trying to just stay humble and stay focused.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.820]   And you know, for the first year we didn't hire anybody,
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.700]   we didn't have any meetings. We didn't do any investor call.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.700]   Like it was just like so simple, like almost this like garden of Eden of like,
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.300]   startups.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.540]   So just like us hanging out with our customers like all the time and like
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.300]   trying to build some stuff that they wanted.
