[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Pastor John, in pursuing daily joy in God, how important is the permanently abiding
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.400]   and indwelling Holy Spirit in me? And if indwelling is important, how do I explain
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.080]   my own personal fluctuating experience of joy in God when the source of my
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.240]   personal joy, the Holy Spirit, is constantly personally present in me at
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   all times? That's a really good question because its premises are right. We
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.240]   do have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is sovereign. He's God. And so why isn't
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.960]   He producing His fruits in me as fully as they could possibly be produced? That's
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.640]   a really, really good question. And one of those fruits is His joy, His patience.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.680]   And if you go to the book of Ephesians, there are clues that, in fact, the Holy
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.640]   Spirit doesn't govern us that way. Ephesians 5, 18, "Be filled with the Holy
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.440]   Spirit," clearly signals there are gradations of fullness, and that means, I
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.800]   think, gradations of His control. That is, He is willing to let Himself be more or
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.640]   less resisted. He says in Ephesians 4, 30, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit." So the
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.340]   Holy Spirit is willing to let Himself be grieved by certain attitudes that we
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.440]   have. That doesn't mean that the Holy Spirit has ceased to be God, that He somehow ceased
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.960]   to have the power to sanctify us. It means that He has His sovereign reasons
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.000]   for why He would be willing to be grieved by us. And chapter 1, verse 17 of
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.440]   Ephesians--it's just amazing how many of these are in Ephesians--Paul prays for
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.160]   saints that the eyes of our heart would be opened to know our calling and to see
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   the greatness of our inheritance and the power at work in those who believe. Now, why would he pray that?
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   Well, because our eyes get dull. And if our eyes get dull, our feelings get dull. And
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   the Holy Spirit answers that by opening the eyes of our hearts, which means He
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.240]   could have kept them open, but He has His reasons for allowing there to be these
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.440]   seasons of seeing less clearly. Same thing in Ephesians 3, verse 18, where Paul
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.600]   prays that the Lord Jesus--that you be strengthened with power in your heart,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.360]   according to His Spirit, that Christ would dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   That's a strange thing to pray for a Christian, isn't it? We all have Christ
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   within us, we all have the Holy Spirit within us, and yet he's praying that
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.160]   Christ would dwell. And I think that means that Christ would dwell manifestly,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.760]   that Christ would dwell powerfully, all of which simply says both the Holy
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.040]   Spirit and the indwelling Christ are there, and they're there always for the
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.640]   believer. They don't go in and out, but they are there in different levels of
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.540]   power, different levels of manifestation, different levels of control. And if you
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.840]   ask me why, why wouldn't He just take us straight there, I would say the same
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.080]   reason He doesn't knock the devil out entirely, which He could do this
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.360]   afternoon, He could just end the devil's existence entirely, He could change
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.440]   history entirely, He could bring the kingdom entirely. Instead, He is working
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.460]   progressively with us, because evidently He gets more glory through the kinds of
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.280]   battles Christians fight with their own sin than if we were to just be
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520]   transformed in an instant.
