[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, how is my obedience connected to my joy?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   It's a question today from Jonathan.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280]   "Hi, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.080]   I'm a seminary student in South Africa.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   My question is about Christian hedonism.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.580]   What a deep and powerful thing enjoying God is, which God used greatly in my conversion.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.780]   After a couple of years, however, my joy in God grew very dim.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.840]   Not only my joy, but also my contentment and prizing of God above all else.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.480]   A most joyful state, but it disappeared.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.560]   This is especially true when I fall into sin.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.820]   I feel that sin blinds me to who God is, and thus I don't enjoy Him for who He is because
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.720]   I can't see Him for who He is.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.060]   Is that true?
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.240]   And how much of our joy in Christ is only achievable and possible in a state of robust
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.040]   obedience to Christ?"
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.080]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jonathan?
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.760]   I'm going to say things a little differently than Jonathan, but first let me affirm his
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.320]   insight, namely, that when we are living in disobedience to Christ, our joy in Him will
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.120]   be minimal or nonexistent, depending on the depth and duration of the disobedience.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   That's true.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.640]   So you might say, "Our greatest enjoyment of Christ can only be enjoyed, can be had
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.360]   in a robust state of obedience."
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.440]   I think that's true.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.360]   But I think it's important to penetrate into the relationship between obedience and joy
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.040]   a little more deeply instead of simply saying, "If you obey Jesus, your joy will be greater."
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   Because if we leave it at that, we won't really see clearly what the nature of obedience
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.180]   is and its relationship to joy in Christ.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.600]   I would ask Jonathan, or anybody, "Do you think that obedience to Jesus is distinct
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.800]   from enjoying Jesus?"
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.240]   In other words, is it accurate to think of obeying Him as one thing and then as a result
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.840]   of doing that, this other thing happens called enjoying Him?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.240]   It's really not like that.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   Why not?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.280]   Well, first, because we are commanded to enjoy Him, "Delight yourself in the Lord" (Psalm
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.480]   37:4) and elsewhere, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.720]   So that obedience to that command is enjoyment of God, not just a cause of enjoyment.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:57.320]   And second, because all Christ-honoring obedience is rooted in our treasuring Jesus, our enjoying
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.240]   Jesus, so that it wouldn't be accurate to say that enjoying Jesus is only the result
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.640]   of obedience when in fact it's part of obedience and the cause of obedience, or the root of
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.920]   obedience.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   So what Jonathan is saying is not at all wrong.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.480]   It's only half, or maybe a third, of the picture.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.560]   He's stressing that the utterly necessary truth that whenever we are walking in disobedience,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.760]   our joy is going to be limited or canceled, that's true.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.320]   And you can see it especially in John 14, 21-23, where Jesus says, "Whoever has my commandments
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.440]   and keeps them, he it is who loves me, and he who loves me will be loved by my Father,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   and I will love him and manifest myself to him."
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.960]   In other words, there's a correlation between our loving Jesus and keeping His commandments
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.200]   and the clarity and sweetness of the manifestation that we have of Jesus and the Father in our
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   hearts.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   "I will manifest myself to him," Jesus says, "as he is loving me and walking in fellowship
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.700]   with me and keeping my words."
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.160]   Those manifestations of the preciousness and sweetness and power and reality and presence
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.000]   and beauty and worth of Jesus will be forfeited when we are loving other things more than
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Jesus and not keeping His Word.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's true.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.700]   That's the truth that Jonathan is seeing and emphasizing.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.760]   He has experienced the loss of joy and of the intimate, sweet manifestations of Christ
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.520]   to his soul because he's walked in sin.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   That's true.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.240]   That's what will happen.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.480]   But there's another side to this, which if we miss it, there will be no way out for Jonathan.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.320]   How's he going to get out of this?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.320]   If he thinks simply in terms of, "I've got to obey so that I can enjoy," if that's the
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.440]   only way he's thinking, he'll never get out.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   Because seeing Jesus as satisfying and experiencing Him as precious is the pathway to obedience,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.200]   not just the result of obedience.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:41.280]   You can't obey first in order to enjoy if the enjoyment in Him is the path to obedience.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:50.820]   If we treat obedience as something that you do first and then all joy in Jesus follows,
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.040]   we will have turned obedience into a work of the law or a legal external performance
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.600]   that has in it no Christ-exalting worth and therefore will not result in true enjoyment
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.520]   of Jesus.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:16.840]   All Christ-exalting, all gospel-rooted obedience is the obedience of faith, Romans 1:5.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.640]   It comes from faith.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.680]   Obedience comes from faith.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:29.040]   And faith is a seeing and savoring of the truth and beauty and worth of Jesus in the
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   gospel.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   Therefore, faith, specifically what Paul calls in Philippians 1:25, the joy of faith is the
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   root of all Christ-exalting obedience, not just the fruit.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:53.040]   So by all means, Jonathan, cease from all the outward actings of sin.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:02.400]   Cease, but let the main battle of your life be not just against outward actions that have
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:11.440]   to change, but mainly against inward blindness that needs to be overcome with fresh glimpses
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   of the glory of Christ.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.080]   Then the new obedience will not be a tribute to your willpower, but a tribute to the beauty
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.880]   of Christ that has broken the power of the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   Jonathan has been walking in disobedience because of the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   Hebrews 3:13, Ephesians 4:22, "Sin is telling lies to him.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.800]   It is saying that the path of disobedience will produce more pleasure."
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   It won't.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.800]   It's a lie.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.320]   The pleasures are fleeting, Hebrews 11:25.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.020]   They are shallow.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:57.600]   So the battle to be fought in Jonathan's heart, in all of our hearts, is not just how to stop
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.520]   doing bad things so that we can enjoy Jesus.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   But how to stop believing false things.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:16.800]   The answer is, by all means forsake bad behaviors, but mainly the battle is, look to Jesus.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:25.840]   Look to all that God is for you in him and pray for eyes to see his all-satisfying beauty
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:34.400]   and worth so that you rest in him and are so satisfied that the root of sin is severed
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.440]   and you walk in obedience.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.720]   Beautiful.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   Well articulated.
