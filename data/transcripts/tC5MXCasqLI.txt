[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're back with Dr. Russell Moore of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission filling in
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   this week for John Piper.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.620]   Not surprisingly, Dr. Moore, we're seeing a surge of evangelicals who have come out
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.240]   in support of so-called same-sex marriage, including Christian organizations, missions
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240]   agencies, churches, denominations, prominent pastors, recording artists, musicians, and
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   authors, etc.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.600]   I'm sure in the months ahead, a pro-gay marriage book will be endorsed by a Christian
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.560]   leader who will surprise us.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.680]   Tweets, interviews, YouTube clips will surface and surprise us with the words of some unlikely
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.960]   teachers that we thought we knew.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.160]   In light of all of this, what advice would you give ordinary Christians when these out-of-nowhere
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.800]   controversies in the church blow up in their Twitter feeds?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.360]   That's a really good question, and I think you're right.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.880]   We are going to see more and more people within evangelical Christianity starting to capitulate
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.200]   on some of these core issues.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   I think what some people are doing right now is gauging what the landscape is like.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.400]   I mean, look atâ€”there's always this sort of figure in evangelical life who is out on
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.120]   the edge questioning key Christian doctrines, but doing so in a kind of ambiguous way.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.160]   And then typically at some point or other, that person has to forthrightly state what
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160]   he or she believes.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.200]   And once that happens, once that is an actual denial of some biblical doctrine, that person
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.800]   then loses his or her audience.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   We've seen that just over and over and over again.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.920]   So I think there are some people who are gauging, "How far out there can I get on some of
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.840]   these issues before I lose my place in evangelicalism?"
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.520]   And so that's going to happen.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.880]   And I think we need to make sure that we have a different attitude toward sheep and toward
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   shepherds.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.840]   Jesus is never shocked by what He encounters among the sheep, among people, among those
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.800]   who are the lost that He came to save.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.000]   There is no sense of being offended and surprised.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.720]   The woman at the well, He encounters her with what her sin is.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.080]   He recounts that to her.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.000]   And so there's a sense of brokenheartedness and a sense of gentleness toward those who
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.960]   are sheep without a shepherd, as the Bible says.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.200]   But there's a much sharper sort of tone that is used by Jesus and the apostles toward those
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.660]   who put themselves in the place of shepherds, as James would say, those who are held to
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.680]   a higher account because they are teachers.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.980]   I think we have to do the same thing.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.280]   We have to have a very different tone with that lost person in our community that we're
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.440]   sharing the gospel with from the way that we would respond to someone who is sitting
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.040]   in a place of authority, teaching as though with the authority of Christ, something that
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.240]   is not only true but that can destroy people's eternal salvation.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.400]   So we need to keep two different tones working.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.640]   First thing that we need to do when that sort of thing shows up on our Twitter feed or Facebook
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.880]   is to make sure that it's true.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.160]   One of the things that happens is we tend to think sometimes that people are just ideas
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   if they're sort of celebrities and we don't know them.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.200]   So we tend to believe everything that is said.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.360]   And sometimes there are reports that aren't true.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.920]   People twist something that someone said or people put a different spin on it than is
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.160]   what is actually there.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.600]   We need to make sure that it's true.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.920]   And so we investigate that, we see that.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.000]   Secondly, I think we ought not to be shocked.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   There are always going to be false teachers and then there are also always going to be
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.480]   people who aren't false teachers but people who make errors.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.760]   So there's a difference, for instance, between Judas Iscariot, who is not even a Christian,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   he doesn't even know the Lord, and he's a son of perdition but is pretending as though
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   he is.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.040]   He's there among Jesus' disciples.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.840]   There's a difference between Judas Iscariot and, say, Simon Peter, someone who also denies
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.160]   Christ, someone who even after he's restored makes the critical error, a gospel-denying
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.880]   error of refusing to eat with Gentiles.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.920]   Paul rebukes him and he backs down.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.000]   We shouldn't be surprised that that's going to happen.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.680]   But we shouldn't be thrown by that.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.800]   The apostle Paul tells us there are going to be those who are teaching things that are
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.600]   contrary to the gospel.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.920]   But notice what he says to Timothy.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.360]   He says, "Like Janus and Jambres," those magicians that were opposing the work of Moses, "they
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.360]   will not get very far."
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.320]   And so we ought not to be despondent, we ought not to be gloomy, we ought not to be everything
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.200]   slouching toward Gomorrah.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.580]   We expect it and we call it what it is when it is seen.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.360]   But we do that by giving room for repentance.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.960]   Now you think about this, the apostle Paul withstood Peter to his face about that matter
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.160]   of table fellowship with the Gentiles, and Peter repented, he turned around.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.000]   We ought not to see people as sort of cartoon characters out there that aren't people who
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.960]   can still respond to rebuke and respond to repentance, and we need to give people the
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.040]   ability to do that.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.840]   I remember having a conversation with a pastor friend one time, and he was saying to me,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.320]   trying to think through the issue of same-sex marriage, and he said, "What if we just were
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   to make a deal where we'll just say, 'You all can have same-sex marriage out there in
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.080]   the civil arena, and we're just going to make sure that we have biblical marriage within
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.560]   our own churches, and we're just having coffee.'"
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.260]   And I said, "Well, that won't work, and here's why that won't work."
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.560]   And I kind of walked through with him why we wouldn't be able to make that deal, and
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.000]   why it would be wrong to try to make that deal.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.580]   And he said, "I see what you're saying."
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.880]   And it occurred to me later that if he had been on the radio or on a podcast or some
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.920]   other venue and said that, he probably would have created a firestorm, and he may not have
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   even had the opportunity to then back down and to say, "You know what?
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   I was wrong."
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.580]   And that's especially true because so many of us in our sinfulness, and I count myself
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.420]   really high on this list, it's really hard once people start attacking you to then turn
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.380]   around and say, "Let me reconsider this.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.380]   Maybe I was wrong."
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.500]   We need to give people the room to be able to do that.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.260]   And then finally, I think we need to model how to be courageous while at the same time
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.260]   being overheard.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:21.260]   I mean, when one thinks about the different sorts of ways that Jesus and the apostles
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.380]   speak to different audiences, Paul speaks to the church at Galatia really, really sharply,
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.580]   and he speaks to the church at Philippi really gently.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.820]   We're in a situation now because of social media where we're speaking to multiple audiences
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.700]   all at the same time.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.420]   So we have to figure out how to rebuke and to sharply rebuke false teaching while at
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.760]   the same time recognizing that we're going to be overheard by lost people.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.560]   We're gonna be speaking to shepherds who are in error, but we're also going to be heard
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.420]   by sheep that Jesus sent us to seek and to call out towards salvation.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.380]   And so to keep that in mind in whatever it is that we post, whatever it is that we say,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.820]   whatever it is that we write.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.460]   Thank you, Dr. Moore, for this wise gospel-centered counsel.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.300]   Dr. Moore serves as the eighth president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.860]   of the Southern Baptist Convention, and he'll be joining us this week filling in for John
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.860]   Piper.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.140]   You can keep up with Dr. Moore and the ERLC at erlc.com.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.540]   Well, as Christian culture continues changing and we see some massive ethical shifts taking
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.420]   place and as culture secularizes, what is the church to do?
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.340]   What opportunities will we have?
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.340]   That's tomorrow.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.340]   Thanks for listening to the Aspester John Podcast.
