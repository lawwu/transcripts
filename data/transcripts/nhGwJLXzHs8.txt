[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   The following is a conversation with Brian Keating,
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.160]   experimental physicist at USSD
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.760]   and author of "Losing the Nobel Prize"
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.280]   and "Into the Impossible."
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.680]   Plus, he's a host of the amazing podcast
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.880]   of the same name called "Into the Impossible."
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.020]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.160]   in the description.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.980]   And now, here's my conversation with Brian Keating.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.560]   As an experimental physicist,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   what do you think is the most amazing
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.680]   or maybe the coolest measurement device
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   you've ever worked with or humans have ever built?
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.560]   Maybe for now, let's exclude the background imaging
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.240]   of cosmic extragalactic polarization instruments.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.320]   - Yeah, I'm slightly biased
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.800]   towards that particular instrument.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.080]   - We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.600]   - Yeah, but certainly the telescope to me
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800]   is a lever that has literally moved the earth
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.640]   throughout history.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.000]   - So the OG telescope?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.040]   - The OG telescope, yeah.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040]   The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880]   but by this guy Hans Lippershey in the Netherlands.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.680]   And it was kind of interesting
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.400]   because in the 1600s, 14, 1500, 1600s,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.380]   it was the beginning of movable type.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.400]   And so people for the first time in history
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.020]   had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.480]   So looking at a printed word now,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.920]   we just take it for granted, 12-point font, whatever,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.400]   and that's what the eye charts are based on.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.240]   They're just fixed height.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   But back then, there was no way to adjust your eyesight
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.300]   if you didn't have perfect vision.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.320]   And there was no way to even tell
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.400]   if you had perfect vision or not
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   until the Gutenberg Bible and movable type.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.240]   And at that time, people realized,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   "Hey, wait, I can't read this.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.220]   "My priest or my friend over here,
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.600]   "he can read it, she can read it.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.440]   "I can't read it.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   "What's going on?"
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.240]   And that's when these people in Venice
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.500]   and in the Netherlands saw that they could take
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080]   this kind of glass material and hold it up
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.880]   and maybe put another piece of glass material
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.520]   and it would make it clearer.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   And what was so interesting is that nobody thought
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600]   to take that exact same device, two lenses,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.560]   and go like, "Hmm, let me go like this
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160]   "and look at that bright thing in the sky over there,"
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.400]   until Galileo.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.160]   So Galileo didn't invent it,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.440]   but he did something kind of amazing.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.760]   He improved on it by a factor of 10.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000]   So he 10X'd it, which is almost as good
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.280]   as going from zero to one as going from one to 10.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.860]   And when he did that, he really transformed
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.480]   both how we look at the universe and think about it,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.600]   but also who we are as a species,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.240]   because we're using tools not to get food faster
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   or to preserve our legacy for future generations,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.720]   but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.000]   - Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans weren't able
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   to see the star, maybe there was some kind of makeup
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.880]   of the atmosphere which, for the early humans,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.740]   made it impossible to see the stars,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.820]   that we would never develop human civilization,
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.400]   or at least raising the question of how important is it
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.820]   to look up to the sky and wonder what's out there,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.980]   as opposed to, maybe this is an over-romanticized notion,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.680]   but looking at the ground, it feels like a little bit
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.760]   too much focused on survival,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.380]   not being eaten by a bear/lion.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.300]   If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder,
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.660]   "What is my place in the universe?"
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.500]   You think that's modern humans romanticizing?
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.840]   - I think it's a little romantic,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.080]   because they also took the same--
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.920]   - That's right.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.040]   - They took the same two lenses and they looked inward.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.280]   They looked at bacteria, they looked at mares,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   and in other words, they made the microscope,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   and we're still doing that.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.480]   And so, to have a telescope serves a dual purpose.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.840]   It's not only a way of looking out, it's looking in,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.440]   but it's also looking back in time.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.660]   In other words, if you can see a microscope,
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.960]   you don't think, "Oh, I'm seeing this thing
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.760]   "as it was one nanosecond ago."
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.900]   Light travels one foot per nanosecond.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.840]   "I'm seeing it in a--"
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   No, you don't think about it like that,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.680]   but when you see something that's happening
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   on Jupiter, the moon, Andromeda galaxy,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.640]   you're seeing things back when Lucy
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.040]   was walking around the Serengeti Plains.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   And for that, I think that took then
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.840]   the knowledge of relativity and time travel and so forth,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.740]   it took that before we could really say,
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.320]   "Oh, we really unlocked some cheat codes
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.200]   "in the human brain."
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.100]   So I think that might be a little too much,
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.800]   but nevertheless, I mean,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.160]   what's better than having a time machine?
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.360]   We can look back in time, we see things as they were,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.160]   not as they are, and that allows us to do many things,
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.640]   including speculate about that.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.720]   But one of the coolest things,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.560]   I don't know if you're familiar with,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.920]   so I'm a radio astronomer.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.280]   I don't actually look through telescopes very often,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.940]   except on rare occasions when I take one out
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.040]   to show the kids.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.760]   But a radio telescope is even more sort of visceral.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.200]   I mean, it's much less cool 'cause you look at it,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.120]   you're like, "All right, it looks cool.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.640]   "It's got a weird-shaped thing.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.920]   "It looks like it belongs in sci-fi.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.080]   "It's gonna blast the Death Star," or whatever.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   But when you realize that when you point a radio telescope
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.540]   at a distant object,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.920]   if that object fills up what's called the beam,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.380]   which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.520]   it's called its beam.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   If you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.760]   just a simple absorbing piece of material,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.720]   at the focus of the radio telescope,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.160]   that resistor will come to the exact same temperature
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.920]   as the object it's looking at, which is pretty amazing.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   It means you're actually remotely measuring,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   you're taking the temperature of Jupiter
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.120]   or whatever in effect.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.600]   And so it's allowing you to basically teleport.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.840]   And there's no other science
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.000]   that you can really do that, right?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.320]   If you're an archeologist, you can't.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.600]   Let me get into my time machine and go back and see,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.240]   what was Lucy really like?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.080]   It's not possible.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.820]   - So the same thing happens,
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.220]   this is where I learned about this,
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.320]   from March of the Penguins,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.980]   when the penguins huddle together,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.240]   the body temperature arrives at the same place.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   So you're doing this remotely.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.880]   This is the March of the Penguins, but remote.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.160]   - We do it from Antarctica too,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.480]   so there are some penguins around when we do it.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   - Okay, excellent.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.520]   You mentioned time machine.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   I think in your book, "Losing the Nobel Prize,"
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.700]   you talk about time machines.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.400]   So let me ask you the question of,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.520]   take us back in time.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   What happened at the beginning of our universe?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.660]   - Ah, okay.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.160]   Usually people preface this by saying,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.360]   I have a simple question.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   What happened before the universe began?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.520]   - Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.000]   I have a simple question for you, let's take two.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   I have a simple question.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.840]   What happened at the beginning of our universe?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.680]   There you go.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.500]   - All right, good.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.160]   So when we think about what happened,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.540]   it's more correct, it's more logical,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.480]   it's more practical to go back in time,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.640]   starting from today.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.640]   So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   that's some day, right?
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   I mean, you could translate it into some day, right?
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.080]   So on that day, something happened earlier
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   than the moment exactly now,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.160]   let's say we're talking around one o'clock.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.480]   So at some point during that day,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.200]   the universe started to become a fusion reactor.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.120]   It started to fuse light elements and isotopes
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.680]   into heavier elements and isotopes
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.520]   of those heavier elements.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.080]   After that period of time,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.600]   going forward back closer to today,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.640]   less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.940]   or later rather, coming towards us today,
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.400]   we know more and more about what the universe was like.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.520]   And in fact, all the hydrogen,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.920]   to very good approximation,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.160]   in the water molecules in this bottle,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.400]   almost all of them were produced
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.660]   during that first 20 minute period.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.800]   So I would say, the actual fusion and production
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.560]   of the lightest elements on the periodic table
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.360]   occurred in a time period shorter
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   than the TV show, "The Big Bang Theory."
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   - Well done, sir.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   (laughing)
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.160]   - Most of those light elements, besides hydrogen,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.640]   aren't really used in your encounter, right?
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.700]   We don't encounter helium that often,
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.340]   unless you go to a lot of birthday parties,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.160]   or pilot a blimp.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.400]   You don't need lithium, hopefully.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.080]   But other than that, those are the kind of things
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.320]   that were produced during that moment.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.300]   The question became, how did the heavier things,
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.800]   like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.760]   And I brought some samples for us to discuss,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.260]   and how those came from a very different type of process,
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.640]   called a different type of fusion reactor,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.160]   and a different type of process explosion as well,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   called a supernova.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.060]   However, if you go back to the,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.540]   beyond those first three minutes,
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.920]   we really have to say almost nothing,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.280]   because we are not capable, in other words,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.860]   going backwards from the first three minutes,
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.880]   as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book,
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.200]   we actually, marks a point where ignorance takes over.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.320]   In other words, we can't speculate on what happened
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.960]   three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.400]   was formed in our universe.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.760]   We just don't know enough about that epoch.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.320]   There are many people, most people,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.840]   most practicing card-carrying cosmologists,
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.520]   believe the universe began in what's called a singularity.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.400]   And we can certainly talk about that.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.440]   However, singularity is so far removed
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.120]   from anything we can ever hope to prove,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.920]   hope to confront, or hope to observe as evidence,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.900]   and really only occurs in two instantiations,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.960]   the Big Bang and the core of a black hole,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   neither of which is observable.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.120]   And so for that reason,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.860]   there are now flourishing alternatives that say,
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.240]   you can actually, for the first time, ask the question,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   that day, Tuesday, in the first moments of our universe,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.320]   there was a Tuesday a week before that,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.520]   24 hours times seven days before that.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.880]   That has a perfectly well-understood meaning
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.120]   in models of cosmology,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.120]   promoted by some of the more eminent
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.960]   of cosmologists working today.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.600]   When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.120]   no one really considered anything besides that Big Bang,
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.960]   that there was a singularity,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.840]   and people would have to say, as I said, we just don't know.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.260]   But they would say, some future incarnation
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.280]   of some experiment will tell us the answer.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.360]   But now there are people that are saying,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.820]   there is an alternative to the Big Bang.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.920]   And it's not really fringe science as it once was,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.360]   50, 80 years ago, when these models,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   by the way, the first cosmology in history
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   was not a singular universe.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.760]   The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten Ra
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.200]   and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.680]   And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.660]   So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.060]   he'd have a pretty high H index right about now,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.820]   because people have been using that cyclical model
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.220]   from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.340]   and right up until this very moment.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.580]   - Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.860]   to the Big Bang theory?
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.340]   - So there are many alternatives, starting with,
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.100]   so the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.340]   singular origin of the universe,
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.260]   that stands in contrast to these other models,
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260]   in which time does not have a beginning.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.540]   And many of them feature cycles, at least one cycle,
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.980]   possibly infinite number of cycles,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.260]   called by Sir Roger Penrose.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.280]   And they all have things in common, these alternatives,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.440]   as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.580]   which is inflation.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.500]   Inflation is sort of, can be thought of as this spark
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.380]   that ignites the hot Big Bang that I said we understood.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.000]   So it's an earlier condition,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.940]   but it's still not an initial condition.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.060]   In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.840]   or a pendulum swinging back and forth.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.780]   You look away for a second, you come into the room,
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.820]   pendulum swinging back and forth.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.820]   Alex, tell me, where did it start?
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.960]   How many cycles is it gonna make before the,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.180]   you can't answer that question
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.140]   without knowing the initial conditions.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.460]   In a very simple system, like a one dimensional
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.620]   simple harmonic oscillator, like a pendulum.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.580]   Think about understanding the whole universe
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.740]   without understanding the initial conditions.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.280]   It's a tremendous lacuna gap that we have as scientists,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.640]   that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.400]   determine the quantitative physical properties
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.120]   of the universe prior to what's called
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.480]   the inflationary epoch.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.600]   - So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch, we can't.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.320]   'Cause you can infer things about the pendulum
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.960]   before you show up to the room in our current epoch, correct?
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.040]   - Right, yeah, so if you look at it right now,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.920]   but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.320]   So that depends on how much energy it got initially,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.400]   and you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.240]   you had infrared camera,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.800]   you could see it's getting hotter maybe,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.480]   and you could do some calculations.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.560]   But to know the two things in physics
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.200]   to solve a partial differential equation
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.300]   are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.400]   Boundary conditions, we're here on Earth,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.680]   it has a gravitational field, it's not gonna excurs,
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.700]   It's not, it has simple properties.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.040]   But this is like, in other words, you can't tell me,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.080]   when did the solar system start orbiting
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.360]   in the way that it does now?
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.800]   In other words, when did the moon acquire
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.980]   the exact angular momentum that it has now?
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.760]   Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example,
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.440]   but what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.120]   purports and is successful at providing a lot of explanations
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.620]   for how the universe evolved
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.960]   after inflation took place and ended,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.480]   but it says nothing about how it itself took place.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.120]   And that's really what you're asking me.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.600]   I mean, you don't, look, you care about
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.240]   like big bang nucleosynthesis, and the elements got made,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.520]   and these fusion reactors,
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.440]   and the whole universe was a fusion reactor,
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.120]   but like, don't you really care about what happened
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.800]   at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.560]   And the problem is we can't really answer that
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.360]   in the context of the big bang.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.120]   We can't answer that in the context of these alternatives.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.360]   So you asked me about some of the alternatives.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.480]   So one is Aeon theory,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.440]   the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.280]   Another one that's, it was really popular
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.740]   in the '60s and '70s, until the discovery
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.360]   of the primary component of my research field,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.680]   the cosmic microwave background radiation, or CMB,
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.520]   the three Kelvin all-pervasive signal
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   that astronomers detected in 1965.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.580]   That kind of spelled the death knell in some sense
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.520]   to what was called the quasi-steady state universe.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.980]   And then there was another model
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.580]   that kind of came out of that.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.080]   You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.560]   Steady state means always existed.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.400]   That was a cosmology Einstein believed
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.280]   until Hubble showed him evidence
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   for the expansion of the universe.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   And most scientists believed in that for millennia,
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.920]   basically, the universe was eternal, static, unchanging.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.380]   They couldn't believe that after Hubble,
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.840]   so they had to append onto it,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.240]   concatenate this new feature that it wasn't steady,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.720]   it was quasi-steady.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.200]   So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.040]   every century in a given volume of space.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.160]   And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.320]   but because it was producing more and more every century,
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   as centuries pile up and the volume piles up,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.640]   the universe could expand.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   And so that's how they developed it.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.440]   - But slowly. - Very slowly.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.680]   And it doesn't match observational evidence,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400]   but that is an alternative.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.480]   - By the way, did Einstein think
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.640]   the steady state universe is infinite or finite?
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.480]   Do you know?
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.680]   - I would assume that he thought it was infinite
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.560]   because there was really,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.520]   if something had a no beginning in time,
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.960]   then it would be very unlikely we're in the center of it
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.320]   or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.360]   - I wonder what he thought about infinity,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.600]   'cause that's such an uncomfortable--
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.840]   - I guess it's a silly joke.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.040]   I'm sure you're familiar with that silly joke, right?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.240]   The silly joke was that there are only two things
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.940]   that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.880]   and I'm not sure about the universe.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.240]   - Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.120]   is a good example of the joke.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.400]   It's very meta.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.880]   Okay, so, all right, so sorry,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.160]   you were saying about quasi--
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   - All the alternatives.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.920]   - All the alternatives in the quasi-steady state.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.800]   - And the most kind of promising,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.320]   although I hate to say that,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.080]   people say, "What's your favorite alternative?"
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.480]   - This is not investment advice.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   - Inflation is not transitory, it is quasi-permanent.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.760]   So a very prominent--
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.180]   - Sorry to interrupt, we're talking about cosmic inflation,
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.280]   so calm down cryptocurrency folks.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.080]   - That's right, although the first Nobel Prize,
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.160]   and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.360]   was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.200]   So most people don't know that.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.520]   Inflation has already won a Nobel Prize.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.320]   - It's a good topic to work on if you won a Nobel Prize.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.080]   Doesn't matter the field.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.320]   - Exactly, it's time translation invariant.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.880]   So when we look at the alternative
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.080]   that's called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   these have serious virtues according to some.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.040]   One of the virtues to me, just as a human,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   I'm just speaking as a human,
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.640]   one of the founders of the new version
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.520]   is Paul Steinhardt.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.720]   He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.000]   at Princeton University, you may have heard of it.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.520]   And he was one of the originators
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.240]   of what was called new inflation.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.360]   In other words, he was one of the founding fathers
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.520]   of inflation, who now not only has no belief
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.160]   or support for inflation, he actively claims
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.080]   that inflation is baroque, pernicious, dangerous,
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.680]   malevolent, not to science, not just to cosmology,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.960]   but to society.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.440]   So here's a man who created a theory
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.320]   that's captivated the world or universe of cosmologists
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.040]   such as it is, it's not a huge universe,
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.960]   but there are more podcasters than cosmologists.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.160]   Some do both, but this man created this theory
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.200]   with collaborators, and now he's, I joke,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.640]   I'm like, Paul, you're denying paternity.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.080]   You're like a deadbeat dad.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.760]   Now you're saying like inflation is bogus.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.400]   But he doesn't just attack.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.680]   See, this is what's very important
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.560]   about approaching things as an experimentalist.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.560]   You've got a lot of theorists on, and that's wonderful,
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.200]   and I think that's a huge service.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.800]   An experimentalist has to say no.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.440]   He or she has to be confident to say like,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.840]   I don't care if I prove you right
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.320]   or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.120]   We have to be like exterminators,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.320]   and nobody likes the exterminator until they need one,
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.440]   right, or the garbage collectors, right?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.840]   But it's vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.880]   by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.160]   and the simplicity of some idea.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.520]   Like inflation is a beautiful idea,
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.040]   but it also has consequences, and what Paul claims,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.360]   I don't agree with him fully on this point,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.240]   is that those consequences are dangerous
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.480]   because they lead to things like the multiverse,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.800]   which is outside the purview of science.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.280]   And in that sense, I can see support for what he does,
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   but none of that detracts from my respect
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.280]   for a man, you know, imagine like, you know,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.960]   Elon comes up with this like really great idea,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.040]   you know, space, and then he's like,
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.080]   oh, actually, it's not gonna work,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.920]   and you know, but like, here's this better idea,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.600]   and he's like, SpaceX is not gonna work,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.840]   but he's now created an alternative to it.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.480]   It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.000]   Doesn't mean he's right, doesn't mean I'm gonna like,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.560]   have more and more attention paid to it
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.880]   because he's my friend or because I respect the idea
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.480]   or I respect the man and his colleague,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.000]   and he just works really hard with him.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.040]   But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.160]   And what it does most foremost is that it removes
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.760]   the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.660]   So it takes away 50% of the motivation
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.840]   for a theory of quantum gravity.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.120]   You talked a lot about quantum gravity.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.400]   You talked to people, eminent people on the show.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.440]   Always latent in those conversations
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.140]   is sort of the teleological expectation
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.640]   that there is a theory of everything,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.760]   there is a theory of quantum gravity,
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.160]   but there's no law that says we have to have
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.800]   a theory of quantum gravity.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.280]   - So that kind of implicit expectation
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.480]   has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory,
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.360]   so in cosmic inflation, so is that at the core?
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.840]   So okay, maybe you can speak to what is
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.600]   the negative impacts on society
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.440]   from believing in cosmic inflation?
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.720]   - So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.200]   according to its other two patriarchs,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   considered to be its patriarchs,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.560]   Alan Guth at MIT and Andre Linde at Stanford,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.480]   although he was in the USSR when he came up
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.680]   with these ideas, along with Paul Steinhardt,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.880]   was that the universe has to eventually
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.640]   get into a quantum state.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.480]   It has to exist in this Hilbert space,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.280]   and the Hilbert space has certain features,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.760]   and those features are quantum mechanical,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.200]   endowed with quantum mechanical properties.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.340]   And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.080]   So inflation can get started,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.920]   but then it's like one of SpaceX rockets.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.360]   It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.740]   It continues the thrusting, and you need another mechanism
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.200]   to douse the flames of the inflationary expansion,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.160]   which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.600]   it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.920]   including now, spawning an ever-increasing
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.400]   set of universes.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.840]   Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.740]   and this is known as the multiverse paradigm.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.940]   It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence,
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.420]   not only of inflationary cosmology,
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.460]   but more and more we're seeing it in string theory as well.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.500]   So sometimes two branches coming to the same conclusion
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.220]   is taken as evidence for its reality.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.140]   - So one of the negative consequences
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.500]   is it creates phenomena that we can't,
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.300]   that are outside the reach of experimental science?
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.140]   - Yeah.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.060]   - Or is it that the multiverse somehow
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.460]   has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.460]   Like it makes us, maybe it makes life seem more meaningless?
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.900]   Is that where he's getting at a little bit,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.020]   or is it not reaching that far?
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.900]   - Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.940]   The answer is a little of both,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.540]   because in one sense it's meant kind of to explain
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.200]   this fine-tuning problem, that we find ourselves
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.260]   in a universe that's particularly façade,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.780]   that has features consistent with our existence,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.220]   and how could we be otherwise?
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.940]   You know, the sort of weak anthropic principle.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.460]   On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.960]   literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.260]   Like if I say, "Lex, you know, you've been working out,
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.300]   you look like, you know, yeah, you're having,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.140]   yeah, it's great.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.780]   You look like you're about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms."
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.460]   Like, "All right, yeah, you're right,
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.900]   but that's horribly imprecise, so what good is that?
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.740]   That's meaningless.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.660]   You don't contribute any, what's called, surprise,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.540]   or reduction in entropy, or reduction of your ignorance
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.360]   about the system, or you know exactly how much you weigh.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.320]   So me telling you that tells you nothing."
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.940]   In this case, it's basically saying
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.220]   that we're living in a universe
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.220]   because the overwhelming odds of our existence
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.980]   dictate that we would exist.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.700]   There has to be at least one place that we exist.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.140]   But the problem is, it's a manifestation of infinity.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.620]   So humans, and I'm sure you know this
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.940]   from your work with AI and ML and everything else,
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.540]   that humans, as far as we know,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.100]   really are the only entities capable
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.320]   of contemplating infinity,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.620]   but we do so very imperfectly, right?
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.280]   So if I say to you, like, "What's bigger,
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.180]   the number of water molecules in this thing,
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.700]   or the number of real numbers?"
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.220]   Or if I say, "What's bigger, the number of real numbers
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.240]   or rational numbers?"
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.740]   There are all different classifications
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.200]   of the amount of infinities that there could be.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.580]   Infinity to the infinity power.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.780]   You know, when you have kids someday, they'll tell you,
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.940]   "I love you, infinity."
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.140]   You have to come back, "I love you, infinity, plus one."
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.220]   Right, so, but the human brain
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.380]   can't really contemplate infinity.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.160]   Let me illustrate that.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.820]   They say in the singularity,
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.720]   the universe had an infinite temperature, right?
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.460]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.740]   Is there anything that you can contemplate in the,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.420]   Einstein's little quip aside, that's infinite?
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   Like a physical property, density, pressure, temperature,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.900]   energy, that's infinite.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.540]   And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.580]   But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.940]   You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.580]   How does it go from like to half of infinity?
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.700]   'Cause that's still infinity.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.900]   How did it cool down?
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.460]   How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.380]   So now it's only infinity over two in terms of pascals.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.600]   - Less infinite, more infinite.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.740]   Yeah, I mean, it's, that's one of the biggest troubling
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.660]   things to me about infinity is,
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.780]   you can't truly hold it inside our minds.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   It's a mathematical construct that doesn't,
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.820]   it feels like intuition fails.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.980]   But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.740]   and then use, like physicists,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.440]   they're incredible intuition machines,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.980]   and then they'll play with this infinity
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.340]   as if they can play with it on the level of intuition
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.140]   as opposed to on the level of math.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.100]   You know, it may be something cyclical,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.380]   you can imagine infinity just going around the same,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.540]   kind of like a Mobius strip situation.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.740]   But then the question then arises,
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.460]   how do you make it more or less infinite?
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.900]   Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.260]   - And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.340]   It's either some placeholder for infinity,
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.420]   or it's one divided by a very, the smallest possible,
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.660]   real number that you can represent in the memory.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.460]   - Well, that's basically my undergraduate study
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.220]   in computer science is how to represent
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.820]   a floating point in a computer.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.900]   I think I took 17 courses on this topic.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.980]   It was very useful.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.940]   - So I came to the right place.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.540]   But in terms of what a physicist will mean,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.660]   and you're right, I mean, physicists will blindly,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.780]   nonchalantly subtract infinity,
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.180]   renormalization and do things to get finite answers.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.980]   And it's miraculous.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.420]   But at a certain point, you have to ask,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.380]   well, what are the consequences for the real world?
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.220]   So one of them, you ask, what's the problem?
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.740]   Does it make us more meaningless?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.020]   They purport, many of the people that support it,
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.220]   like Andre Linde.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.060]   In fact, Andre Linde says, you have a bias,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.580]   you, Lex, me, Brian, you have a bias
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.980]   that you believe in a universe,
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.940]   but shouldn't you believe in a multiverse?
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.620]   What evidence do you have that there's not a,
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.060]   so he turns it around.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.700]   Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say,
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.500]   no, if anything can happen,
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.920]   then there's no predictive power within the theory.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.260]   Because you can always say, well,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.180]   this value of the inflationary field
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.500]   did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.980]   for us to detect it with BICEP or Simon's Observatory,
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.100]   or whatever, but that doesn't mean
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.180]   that inflation didn't happen.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.740]   And that's logically 100% correct,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.060]   but it's like kinda chewing Wonder Bread.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.580]   I apologize if they're one of your sponsors, but.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.140]   (laughing)
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.740]   - Wonderbread/lex.com.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.660]   - Type in code Kleb, right?
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.420]   Kleb, that's my favorite Russian word,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.540]   is like, would you like a piece of Kleb?
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.900]   - By the way, even that word Kleb,
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.700]   which means bread in Russian,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.900]   as you say it, and you're jokingly saying it now,
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.180]   it made me hungry because it made me remember
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.700]   how much I loved bread when I was in the Soviet Union.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.660]   When you were hungry, that was the things
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.020]   you dreamed about, I don't know.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.700]   - You know, what's amazing is how many
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.100]   of the Soviet scientists contributed
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.120]   to so much of what we understand today,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.380]   and they were completely in hiding.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.260]   Like, there was no Google,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.340]   they couldn't look up on Scholar, they had nothing.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.860]   They had to wait for journals to get approved
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.700]   by the Communist Party to get approved.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.420]   And then, and only then, if they weren't a member
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.980]   of some, I'm sure you know, Jewish scientists,
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.300]   you had a passport that said Jew on your passport.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.740]   And Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.660]   he was the advisor, one of my advisors,
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.180]   Alexander Polnareff, and he had to,
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.500]   only because he was like at a Nobel level
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.740]   and was one of the fathers
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.700]   of the Soviet atomic bomb program,
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.940]   could he even get his Jewish student,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.820]   he was Jewish too, but only by virtue
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.160]   of his standing of his intellectual accomplishments,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.820]   would they give him the dispensation
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.980]   to let his student travel to Georgia or something.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.940]   And it makes what we complain about,
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.500]   and I complain about academia,
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.020]   and it's like, oh, well, what can I talk about?
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.160]   We have no idea of how good it is,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.900]   and that they were able to create things
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.160]   like inflation, completely isolated from the West.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.220]   I mean, some of these people didn't meet
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.140]   people like Stephen Hawking until he was almost dead.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.860]   And they just learned this thing through smuggled in,
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.340]   you know, it's a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.860]   There's so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard,
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.380]   probably because they were working,
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.500]   they could pass off as, well, we're doing stuff
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.980]   for the atomic bomb program as well, which they were.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.300]   - At the same time, there is interesting incentives
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.980]   in the Soviet system that maybe we can take this tangent
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.700]   for a brief moment, that because there's a dictatorship,
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.940]   authoritarian regime throughout the history
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.660]   of the 20th century for the Soviet Union,
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.780]   science was prioritized.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.820]   And because the state prioritized it,
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.500]   through the propaganda machines, through the news,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.140]   and so on, it actually was really cool to be a scientist.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.980]   Like, you were highly valued in society,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.820]   maybe that's a better way to say it.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.500]   And I would say, you're saying, like, we have it easy now.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.620]   In that sense, it was kind of beneficial
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.080]   to be a scientist in that society,
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.940]   because you were seen as a hero, as there's--
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.100]   - Yes, Lvovich was hero of the Soviet Republic.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.060]   - And that, you know, there's positives to that.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.300]   I mean, I'm not saying, I would take the negatives
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.780]   or the positives, but it is interesting to see a world
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.140]   in which science was highly prized.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.540]   In the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist,
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.580]   let's just say the American system,
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.580]   the celebrities are the athletes, the actors and actresses,
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.080]   maybe business leaders, musicians,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.860]   and, you know, the people we elect
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.780]   are sort of lawyers and lawyers.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.340]   (laughing)
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.300]   So it's interesting to think of a world
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.940]   where science was highly prized,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.820]   but they had to do that science
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.020]   within the constraints of always having Big Brother watching.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.260]   - Yeah, same in Germany.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.020]   Germany had, you know, highly prized science.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.540]   I mean, one of the most famous, tragic to me, cases
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.800]   is Fritz Haber, who invented the Haber-Bosch process
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.780]   that allowed us to, I don't know, have you eaten yet?
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.740]   You look, I mean, I know you fast,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.020]   intermittent fast every day, and you do that.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.660]   You know, I said chleb, and you got,
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.820]   it's a little drool, but--
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.460]   - He says I'm lifting and I look slim.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.700]   This is amazing.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.540]   I'm gonna clip this out and put it on Tinder.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.380]   I think that's a website.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.420]   - You gotta swipe left or right for that, I don't know.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.340]   But when you think about, like, you know,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.780]   what he did and created the fertilizer process
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.460]   that we all enjoy and we eat from every day,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.820]   he was a German nationalist first and foremost,
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.140]   even though he was a Jew.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.340]   And he personally went to witness the application
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.340]   of ammonia, chlorine gas, applied during trench warfare
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.580]   in 1916, in battles in Brussels and whatever.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.900]   And he was, they had a whole cadre of Nobel laureates
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.780]   in chemistry and physics, you know,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.460]   that would go and witness these atrocities.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.620]   But that was also, they were almost putting science
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.780]   above, I don't wanna say human dignity,
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.620]   but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.500]   And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.020]   because of the chemical that he invented also
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.540]   called Zyklon B.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.980]   And so it's just unbelievable.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.060]   So I feel like that does have resonance today
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.660]   in this worship of science, you know,
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.300]   and listen to science and follow the science,
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.860]   which is more like scientism.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.140]   And there is still a danger.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.940]   You know, I always say, just 'cause you're an atheist
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.660]   doesn't mean you don't have a religion.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.340]   You know, just because you, you know,
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.740]   in my case, in my books, I talk a lot
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.700]   about the Nobel Prize.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.660]   It's kind of like a kosher idol.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.420]   It's something that you can worship, you know,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   it doesn't do any harm.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.380]   And we want those people that are so significant
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.700]   in their intellectual accomplishments.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.060]   'Cause there is a core of America
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.660]   and the Western world in general that does worship
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.540]   and really look at science predominantly
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.100]   'cause it gives us technology.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.780]   But there's something really cool about that.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.340]   And so for me, it's hard to find that balance point
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.740]   between looking to science for wisdom,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.540]   which I don't think it has, they're two different words,
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.020]   but also recognizing how much good and transformative power,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.980]   maybe our only hope comes from science.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.660]   - You opened so many doors
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   'cause you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.300]   So there's a lot of elements of religiosity to science
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.420]   and to the Nobel Prize that's fascinating to explore.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.140]   And we will, and we still haven't finished the discussion
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.100]   of the beginning of the universe, which we'll return to.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.580]   But now, since you opened the book,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.420]   wow, pun unintended, of losing the Nobel Prize,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.420]   can you tell me the story of BICEP,
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.900]   the Background Imaging of Cosmic
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.180]   Extragalactic Polarization Experiment,
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.460]   BICEP I and BICEP II,
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.180]   and then maybe you can talk about BICEP III.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.340]   But the thing that you cover in your book,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.740]   the human story of it, what happened?
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.700]   - Yeah, that book is, in contrast to the second book,
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.740]   that's like a memoir.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.620]   It's really a description of what it's like to feel,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.880]   what it feels like to be a scientist
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.220]   and to come up with the ignorance, uncertainty,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.260]   imposter syndrome, which I cover in the later book
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.300]   in more detail, but to really feel like
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.540]   you're doing something and it's all you think about.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.580]   It is all-consuming.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.540]   And it's something I couldn't have done now
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.860]   'cause I have too many other wonderful,
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.100]   delightful demands on my time.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.000]   But to go back to that moment when I was first captivated
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.140]   by the night sky, who has a 12-year-old, 13-year-old,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.800]   and really mixed together throughout my scientific story
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   has always been wanting to approach
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.040]   the greatest mystery of all,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.000]   which I think is the existence or non-existence of God.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.960]   So I call myself a practicing agnostic.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.620]   In other words, I do things that religious people do,
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.120]   and I don't do things that atheist people do.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.040]   And I once had this conversation,
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.360]   with my first podcast guest, actually,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.520]   I shouldn't say, oh, I was just having a conversation
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.200]   with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.040]   And I miss him.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.880]   - Name drop.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.320]   - Name drop, yes.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of comments
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   about how many agnostics--
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.560]   - So in case people don't know,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.840]   Brian Keating is the host of Into the Impossible podcast,
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.720]   where he's talked to some of the greatest scientists
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.280]   in the history of science,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.300]   physicists especially in the history of science.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.160]   - So when I talked to Freeman, I said,
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.680]   Freeman, you call yourself an agnostic too.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.520]   Can you tell me something?
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.840]   Like, what do you do on Sundays?
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.680]   Do you go to church?
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.600]   He's like, no, I don't go to church.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.560]   And I'm like, well, imagine there was
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.120]   an intelligent alien, and he was looking down,
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.600]   or she, I don't know, thing was looking down,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.680]   and it saw Freeman, and on Sundays,
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.280]   a group of people go to church,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.600]   but Freeman doesn't go to church.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.640]   And then there's another group of people
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.200]   that don't go to church, and those are called atheists,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   but Freeman calls himself an agnostic,
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.120]   but he does the things that Richard Dawkins,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.960]   he doesn't go to the same church
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.240]   that Richard Dawkins doesn't go to.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.920]   So I said, how would you distinguish yourself,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.840]   if not practice?
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.180]   So I'm a behaviorist.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.800]   I believe you can change your mentality,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.080]   you can influence your mind,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.480]   view your bodily, physical actions.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.520]   So when I was a 12-year-old, I got my first telescope.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.600]   I was actually an altar boy in a Catholic church,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.440]   which is kind of strange for a Jewish kid
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.280]   who grew up in New York.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.880]   Maybe we'll get into that, maybe not.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.800]   But I was just fascinated by these--
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.920]   - Can we get into it for a second?
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.160]   - Okay, yeah, all right, let's go.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.440]   - All right, let's go there.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.120]   Let's go to Baby Brian, or Young Brian.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   - The new sitcom on CBS.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.840]   - Young Brian, born to two Jewish parents.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.160]   My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.520]   He was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.200]   And my mother was an eminent mom
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   and a brilliant English major, et cetera.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   And they raised, they were secular.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.640]   We'd go to, I always joke,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.520]   we'd go to synagogue two times a year,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.160]   on Christmas and Easter.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.940]   No, no, we would go, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, right?
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.520]   That's the typical two-day-a-year Jews.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.320]   And then we'd have matzahs once a year on Passover.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.400]   And that was about it.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   And for years I was like that,
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.120]   until my parents got divorced,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.080]   my mother remarried, and she married an Irish Catholic man
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.360]   by the name of Ray Keating.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.400]   My father's name's James X.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.760]   So when she remarried Ray Keating,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.920]   I was immediately adopted.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.360]   I'm actually adopted into the Keating family.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.720]   And he had nine brothers and sisters,
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.400]   and just warm and gregarious.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.480]   They did Christmas and Easter.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.440]   It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.960]   And I do things with great gusto.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.900]   Whatever I do, I wanna take it all the way.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.320]   So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.320]   in this case, Catholicism.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.280]   So I was baptized, confirmed,
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.880]   and I said, "I wanna go all the way."
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.440]   I became an altar boy in the Catholic church.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.480]   - And you're gonna be the best altar boy there ever was.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.920]   - I had like serious skills.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.400]   You pass that collection basket,
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.720]   I could push people and get 'em to two extra contributions.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.440]   But in this case, I was 13.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.400]   I don't know if you remember when you were 13,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.760]   but if you extrapolate the next level up,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.240]   it's like you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   The next level up from confirmation, altar boy, is priest.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.440]   And I don't know if you're aware of this,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.520]   but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.880]   And as a 13-year-old boy,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.960]   kinda like future forecasting what life's gonna be like
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.200]   for myself if I continue on my path,
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.560]   I found it, maybe I--
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.200]   - The math is not up.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.080]   - That's right.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.360]   There was a serious gap in that future.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.320]   And instead, when I should have been preparing
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.600]   for my bar mitzvah, as most Jewish boys would be,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.480]   a 12, 13-year-old boy, I actually got a telescope
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.120]   and became infatuated with all the things
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.960]   you could see with it.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.280]   It wasn't bigger than that one over there
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   that your hedgehog's looking through.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.000]   Is that a hedgehog?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.080]   - It's a hedgehog in the fog.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.320]   I should mention, and we'll go one by one, these things.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.160]   You've given me some incredible gifts.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.600]   Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.320]   that I put some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.800]   - Now you're officially an experimental astrophysicist.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.040]   - Why experimentalist versus an engineer?
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.480]   - 'Cause you assembled this telescope,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.200]   you gave it a mount, and you connected it to a very powerful--
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.480]   - Yeah, but there's no experiment going on.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.280]   It's just engineering for show.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.120]   It's very shallow.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.520]   Experiment is taking it to the next level
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.920]   and actually achieving something.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.960]   Here, I just built a thing for show.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.800]   - Well, that's always a joke.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.560]   You're an experimental cosmologist.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.880]   I'm like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.120]   Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.080]   soldering things.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.400]   It's not actually doing the stroking
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.000]   of my non-existent beard, contemplating the cyclic
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.200]   versus the bouncing cosmological moment.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.480]   - Just like most of robotics is just using Velcro
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.320]   for things.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.140]   - Right, yeah.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.560]   It's not like having dancing dogs and whatever.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.440]   So telescope.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.320]   - Yes, this telescope.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.360]   What's the story of this little telescope?
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.580]   - This telescope's a very precious thing in some ways.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.520]   It's a symbol of what got me into,
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.160]   what brought me all the blessings I have in my life.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.360]   Came from a telescope.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.480]   And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.760]   You right here, wherever we are,
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.200]   a biggest city on earth, Manhattan,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.680]   where I was growing up as a 12-year-old
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.360]   outside of Manhattan.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.600]   You can see the exact same craters on the moon,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.760]   the same rings of Saturn, the same moons of Jupiter,
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.280]   the same phases of Venus.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.480]   You can see the Andromeda galaxy,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.680]   that's two and a half million light years away from earth.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.480]   You can do that with that little thing over there.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.720]   Or one that's a little more expensive.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.640]   Get one that has a mount
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.240]   and you can attach now your smartphone.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.080]   What the hell is that?
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.520]   I wouldn't have known what that was in 1984.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.000]   And with that, you can do something
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.560]   that no other science to my knowledge
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.840]   can really replicate.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.360]   Maybe biology in some sense.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.680]   But you can experience the physical sensation
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.340]   that Galileo experienced
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.200]   when he turned a telescope like that to Jupiter
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.960]   and saw these four dots around it.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.540]   Or that Saturn had ears as he called it.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.120]   Or that the moon was not crystalline, polished, smooth,
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.520]   and made of this heavenly substance,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.680]   the quintessence substance, right?
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.040]   So where else can you be viscerally connected
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.680]   with the first person to ever make that discovery?
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.520]   Try doing that with the Higgs boson.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.600]   Get yourself an LHC and smash together high luminosity,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.560]   call up Harry Cliff and say,
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.400]   "I wanna replicate."
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.220]   How did you feel?
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.200]   He didn't feel anything.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.240]   None of them felt anything.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.680]   It took years to come out of it.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.080]   You can't do it.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.440]   But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.420]   - That's fascinating.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.160]   It's almost like maybe there's another one like that
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.000]   is fire.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.180]   - Yes. - Like when you build
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.640]   a bonfire, can you actually get it?
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.000]   See, if you use a lighter,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.080]   I think if you actually, by rubbing sticks together
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.880]   or however you do it without any of the modern tools,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.280]   that's probably what that's like.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.860]   And then you get to experience the magic of it,
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.680]   of what early humans, homo sapiens did.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.480]   - You feel what Og felt when he did it that first time.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.920]   By the way, is this a gift?
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.760]   - This is a gift, of course.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.600]   - Okay, I'm, is this--
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.100]   - You need a little bit of a swag upgrade,
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.940]   so I got you some gifts.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.880]   - I will, yeah, this is, I'm pulling a Putin.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.200]   Like, ask if this is a gift.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.280]   I'm making it very uncomfortable for you to say.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.120]   Not really, this piece of black paper.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.000]   - This is actually my childhood telescope here.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.400]   - But now I'm keeping it.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   - That's right. - All right.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.080]   - So looking through this telescope.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.680]   - Was when your love for science was first born.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.500]   - Changed my life.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.320]   Because not only was I doing that,
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.360]   I was replicating what Galileo did,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.520]   but I was, and I'm 100% not comparing myself
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.640]   to Galileo Galilei, okay,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.120]   if there's any confusion out there.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.240]   But I did replicate exactly what he did,
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.760]   and I was like, holy crap, this is weird.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.180]   Let me write it down.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.320]   So it had another effect,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.520]   which all good scientists, budding scientists should do,
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.080]   and all parents should do.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.040]   Get your kid a book, a little notebook,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.760]   tape a pencil to it, write down what you see,
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.960]   what you hypothesize, what you think it's gonna be.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.760]   Not like in the high school, you know,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.720]   like hypothesis, thesis, but just like,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.920]   wow, how did I feel?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.180]   Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.140]   Sketch what you see, the Lagoon Nebula,
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.800]   the Pleiades Seven Sisters,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.880]   you can see them anywhere on Earth.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.360]   And when you do that, again,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.960]   you're connecting two different hemispheres of your brain,
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.120]   as I understand it,
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.660]   and you're connecting them through your fingertips.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.020]   You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips,
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.160]   in your connection between what you see,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.880]   what you observe, and what you write down.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.680]   Then you do research, right?
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.360]   The goal of science is not to just replicate
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.640]   what other people did, is do something new.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.400]   And that's why we call it research,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.000]   and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And in so doing, you start to train a kid
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.800]   at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.640]   It's unbelievable.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.720]   And now we can do even better,
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.040]   'cause you got to share it on Instagram or whatever.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.060]   And you can, by doing so, have an entree
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.700]   into the world of what does it really mean
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.000]   to be a scientist, and do so viscerally.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.600]   You know, I often say, I was taught this
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.840]   by my English teacher, Mrs. Tompkins, in ninth grade,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.600]   that the word educate, it doesn't mean to pour into.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.280]   Let me pour in some facts, intellects,
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.800]   and you know, it's not like machine learning,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.640]   you're just showing like billions of cats,
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.560]   or you know, you're not like forcing it in,
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   you're bringing it out.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.200]   It means to pour out of, in Latin, educare.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.840]   And what more could a teacher want
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.080]   than to have something, the kid is just like gushing.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.920]   No, you're not gonna see like--
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.960]   - To inspire the kid.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.120]   - Yes. - Inspire.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.680]   - Yes. - Shout out to Mrs. Tompkins.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.360]   - Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins, she's watching, yeah.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.880]   She's a big fan. (laughing)
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.120]   Me, she doesn't care for, but you.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.960]   - Yeah, excellent.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.720]   We take those we love for granted.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.920]   This is in Manhattan.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.720]   - This is in Westchester County, New York.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.560]   - Got it.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.280]   So, okay, but then that's where the dream is born.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.160]   - Yeah.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.640]   - But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   So going to university, graduate school, postdoc,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.400]   all the way to where you are today.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.200]   What's that, what are some notable moments in that journey?
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.760]   - So I call that the academic hunger games,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.480]   'cause it's like you're competing against these people
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   who are just getting smarter all the time
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.360]   as you're getting smarter all the time.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.600]   They wanna get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.320]   There's fewer slots to get into college
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.400]   than not in high school.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.880]   There's fewer slots in graduate school.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.360]   There's fewer, very fewer slots to be a postdoc.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.560]   And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.200]   We just did a faculty search at UC San Diego,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.280]   400 applicants for one position.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.920]   It's almost getting impossible.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.840]   I almost can't conceive of doing what these new,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.440]   brilliant young people applying to become
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.680]   an assistant professor at a state university
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.760]   that they're doing.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.960]   It takes so much courage to do that.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.720]   So I went from this kid in New York
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.600]   thinking I would never be a professional astronomer,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.960]   A, because I didn't know any, I'd never seen any,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.640]   I didn't even know that they existed,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.040]   and I thought, who the hell's gonna pay me
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.000]   to look at the stars?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.320]   Like, won't they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   Like, it's just not something I could conceive
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.280]   of getting paid to do, even if I had the brilliance
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.840]   to do it, which I didn't feel I did.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.640]   And then I went to graduate school.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.360]   And during graduate school, I had this kind of
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.800]   on-again, off-again relationship with my father.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.480]   And I knew that he was a mathematician.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.440]   He had left and gotten remarried himself
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.320]   and moved across the country.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.560]   I didn't see him for 15 years.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.080]   And in that time, I learned a lot about him,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.960]   and I learned that he had gotten very interested
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.840]   not in pure mathematics, which he had been
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.360]   a number theorist and contributed seminal work
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   on the Fantine equations, which play a role
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.080]   in Turing's work, you may have seen.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.560]   But anyway, he had become interested,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.880]   turned completely away from that into the foundations
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.080]   of quantum mechanics and relativity, which is physics.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.200]   And by that time, I was at Brown University,
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.880]   and I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll be condensed matter
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.600]   physicist or experimentalist.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.760]   I never thought I'd be a theorist, and I'm not a theorist,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.600]   so it was pretty prescient.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.760]   But it always appealed to me, like, why not do
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.440]   what made me happy as a 12-year-old?
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.080]   We often forget about those primitive things about us
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.920]   are probably the most sustainable, durable,
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.200]   and resilient attributes of our character.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   So with my own kids, I'm like, what are they interested in
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.280]   now when they're young?
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.840]   And it doesn't mean that's what they're gonna do.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.600]   I mean, some of them wanna play Fortnite,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.040]   like professional Fortnite, which there are,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.320]   but the odds of that is less than the odds
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.160]   of being a professor.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.320]   - Can I ask you, is your father still with us?
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.160]   - No.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.600]   - Just in a small tangent.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.520]   - Yeah.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.240]   - Do you miss him, do you think about him?
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.920]   Does his mathematical journey reverberate
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.080]   through who you are?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.200]   - Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.840]   I mean, it did in very many ways,
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.880]   and he's been gone for a long time now.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.640]   Thinking back to that time with him,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.840]   he must have instilled some capacity for me
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.960]   to only wanna spend my time, which is a limited quantity.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.400]   I don't think it's the most limited quantity.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.560]   Maybe we'll talk about that later.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   But to go into only the most challenging,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.880]   interesting things with the limited time
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.120]   that we have while we're alive.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.720]   And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.600]   For me, it was the foundations of the universe,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.760]   and how did it come to be?
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.520]   And I felt like, well, people have been trying
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.240]   since Einstein to outdo Einstein,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.000]   really have made great progress
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.880]   in the foundations of quantum mechanics,
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.640]   but this is an exciting time.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.080]   The COBE satellite had just released its data
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.520]   that the universe had this anisotropy pattern.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.080]   Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.640]   and so forth.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.700]   And so it seemed like this is a good golden age
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.400]   for what I'm gonna do and what I'm most interested in.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.200]   But always throughout that, I wanted to understand,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.480]   I didn't wanna be a wrench monkey.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.080]   No offense to people that just do experiment.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.280]   - And no offense to monkeys.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.720]   - No offense to monkeys, that's right.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.760]   This little guy, sorry, man.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.600]   But thinking back to what animates me,
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.000]   it's not doing the engineering
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.360]   as much as it is getting the data,
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   but there's a lot of steps.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.440]   I wanna be the guy understanding
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:52.000]   what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.280]   So I always joke with my theorist friends,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.800]   call me a closeted theorist.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.680]   I wanna be what they call a guy
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.440]   who hangs out with musicians, a drummer.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.120]   So I wanna be like that for physics,
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:04.960]   for theoretical physics.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.080]   I wanna be like the guy who doesn't do new theory
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.280]   but understands the theory that the new theorists are doing.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.560]   - I love that formulation of a theorist
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   is understanding the source of the signal you're getting.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.000]   Signal is primary.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.480]   The thing you measure is primary,
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.680]   and theory is just the search of explaining
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.840]   how that signal originated, but it's all about the signal.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.240]   I mean, I see the same search for the human mind
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.680]   and neuroscience in that same kind of way.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.920]   It's ultimately about the signal,
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.520]   but you kind of hope to understand
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.880]   how that signal originated.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.160]   That's fascinating.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   That's such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.840]   'cause it ultimately, at the end of the day,
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.480]   is all about the signal.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.200]   - Yeah, yeah, and maybe those two things,
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.560]   the neuroscience and the cosmos,
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.680]   not getting too romantic, but yeah,
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.280]   maybe they're linked in some fundamental way.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.760]   Some fundamental cosmic consciousness,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.560]   but-- - We're gonna get to that.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.400]   - Yeah, yeah, no, we definitely have to get to that.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.520]   (laughs)
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.720]   But getting back to, yeah, so my origins,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.640]   so I always say, and I wanna try this on you.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.200]   You said you wouldn't answer any of my questions,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.280]   but I'm gonna ask you some questions.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.000]   What's the most important day on the calendar?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.560]   Don't tell me the date, but to you,
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.960]   what's the most important day to you every year?
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.600]   - Do I have to answer or do I have to think about this?
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.760]   - No, no, answer.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.360]   You don't have to tell me the exact date on the calendar.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   It could be your mistress's birthday or whatever, but--
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.840]   - I have so many I lose track.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.160]   (laughs)
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.400]   Even though I'm single, how does that even make sense?
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.160]   - I know. - Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.240]   So a day, like a month and a day, yeah.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.560]   I mean, for me, it would be December 31st.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.500]   - Yeah, so I was gonna say New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.920]   Some people say birthday, anniversary, kid's birth.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.200]   They're usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.440]   January means the portal between,
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.680]   the god was the portal between the beginning and the end.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.080]   So you're looking back, maybe 'cause you're Russian,
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.880]   like the death side, the light side,
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.240]   looking forward into January, the beginning, right?
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.200]   (laughs)
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.040]   So everybody's most important day
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.280]   is usually some beginning or something significant.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.240]   For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.640]   It was like, why did the universe get born,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.940]   as I said before?
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.560]   And I didn't think there, again, I didn't, I just,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.720]   there was some mental obstruction that I didn't realize
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.560]   that I could get past,
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.680]   because I didn't think anybody does it.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.840]   Like I knew astronomers knew these answers,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.160]   like the universe at that time,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   between 10 and 20 billion years old.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.720]   Now we know it's 13.872 billion years old.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.520]   It's incredible, the five digit, you know,
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.360]   for significant, five--
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.800]   - What is it again, 13 point--
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.920]   - 13.872 billion years.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.880]   872 million.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.920]   - So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.760]   Is it, what are the error bars on that?
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.280]   - So for me, I'm 50.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.320]   So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.520]   and telling me within 12 hours how old I am.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.360]   - Yeah.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.440]   - Half a percent, percent level accuracy.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.040]   - There's a confidence behind that?
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.600]   - Oh yeah, I mean, there's a significance, yeah.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.080]   No, it's extremely well measured.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.120]   I mean, it's one of the most precise things that we have.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.280]   In contrast to, again, 25 years ago,
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.560]   we didn't know if the universe was 10 billion
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.020]   or 20 billion years old,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.040]   but there were stars in our galaxy
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.520]   that were believed to be as they are,
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.100]   it's about 12 billion years old,
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.680]   or in the universe that were 12 billion.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   So that would be like you being older than your father.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.640]   It was embarrassing.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.360]   - Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.800]   on a tangent on a tangent?
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.400]   How old is the universe?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.960]   Can you dig in onto this number?
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.560]   How do we know currently with those,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.600]   I guess you said four or five--
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.440]   - Significant figures, yeah.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.760]   - Significant digits.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.920]   - So we can come about it from two different ways.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   One, basically they rely on the most important number
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.280]   in cosmology, which is called the Hubble constant.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.680]   The Hubble constant is this weird number
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.160]   that has the following units.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.320]   It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.360]   So it's a speed per distance,
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.760]   which means you multiply it by distance
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.880]   and you get a speed.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.240]   And what is the speed you're measuring?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.120]   Well, you're measuring the speed of a distant galaxy
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.840]   at many megaparsecs away.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.560]   So a galaxy at one megaparsec away.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.800]   This isn't actually strictly true
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.920]   because of local gravitational effects.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.440]   But if you go out, say, one megaparsec away,
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.680]   I would say that that galaxy's moving
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.120]   72 kilometers per second away from you.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.600]   And every galaxy, except for the local,
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.440]   very most local group surrounding us,
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.160]   maybe a half a dozen galaxies,
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   out of 50 to, sorry, out of 500 billion galaxies
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.660]   to perhaps a trillion galaxies.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.840]   So 12 out of that number are moving towards us.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.520]   The rest are moving away from us.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.560]   So that number, if you invert it,
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.640]   if you say, well, when did those things last
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.240]   touch each other, all those galaxies?
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.740]   Now they're really far apart.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.080]   We know how fast they're moving away.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.600]   It's a very simple algebra problem
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.200]   to solve when were they touching.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.960]   That's where you get that number from.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.320]   - So there's the local 12 and then the rest.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.240]   - Ignore the 12, yep.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.200]   - And then ignore the 12 and then look at the others
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.500]   and yeah, then solve the algebra problem.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.980]   How does the stuff in the beginning,
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.620]   the mystery of that beginning epoch
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.420]   change this calculation of--
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.820]   - Very little because actually we understand
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.820]   how there's some other ingredients that go into it,
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.860]   namely how much dark energy there is in the universe,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.400]   how much dark matter there is in the universe,
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.940]   how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera,
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.100]   and how much ordinary matter, like we're made up of,
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.660]   neutrons, protons, croutons.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.500]   - Okay, so the--
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.260]   (laughing)
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.100]   - Morons.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   (laughing)
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   - It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.680]   How does that make sense?
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.440]   - Oh, oh, yeah, so you're talking about the fact
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.920]   that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.800]   that's located at a distance that is farther
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.760]   than the speed of light times the age of the universe.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.600]   Naively you would say that, yeah.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.640]   So you're right, if the universe were static,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.200]   if the universe came into existence,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.520]   and you can conceive of this,
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.480]   universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe,
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.720]   so the universe just started off,
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.520]   those galaxies were, you know,
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.760]   they could be moving towards us, away from us, who knows,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.000]   that you could say, I can see a galaxy
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.800]   that's at a distance of only 13.8 billion years
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.760]   times the speed of light.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.960]   That would be true.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.360]   But the fact that the light is expanding
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.480]   along with the expansion of the universe,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.160]   so imagine there was some very distant past,
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.000]   we were near a galaxy, it's gonna produce some light,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   and that galaxy's going to be moving away from us,
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.380]   the light's gonna be getting more and more red shifted,
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.920]   as it's called, and it's gonna be moving
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.800]   farther and farther away from us as time goes on,
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.880]   there'll be some acceleration
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.780]   as we get into the era of dark energy.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:41.640]   The light signals, there'll be some cone of acceptance,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.160]   if you will, from which, which represents all the events
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.720]   that we could have received information from.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.920]   We can't currently communicate with that galaxy.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.520]   It sent us some light, and now it's moving away,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.480]   and it sent us some light, and because the space
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.880]   is also dragging the photons with it, if you like,
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   the photons are participating
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.080]   in the expansion of the universe,
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.520]   that's why they're red shifting,
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.240]   that we can see things out to where the universe
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   first began expanding, not just when it began existing.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.680]   And because the universe has been expanding
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.080]   for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing down yet,
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.060]   which is a huge surprise, serendipitous surprise,
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.280]   that we can see things approximately three times
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.100]   the age of the universe away from us.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.080]   So we can see, let's call the age of the universe
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.200]   15 billion years, just to make the math simple.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.600]   We see things at 45 billion light years distance
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   in that direction, and we see things
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.240]   at 45 billion light years in that direction,
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.840]   just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.320]   So that means we see things that themselves
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.520]   are 90 billion light years away from each other.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.320]   That's sort of the diameter of the observable universe.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.040]   Is there another universe beyond that?
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:47.880]   We don't know.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.600]   So I'm conjecture, there's not only one,
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.240]   there's an infinite number of them.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.320]   - How are you emotionally okay with the fact
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.960]   that our universe is expanding?
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.800]   So like--
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.720]   - It's gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvy Singer.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.560]   - I grew up in the Soviet Union.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.600]   We watched propaganda films.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.440]   - I realize that you did, yes.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.280]   So there's a famous--
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.800]   - Annie Hall, is that some kind of--
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.680]   - It's a communist party, a propagandist movie
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.800]   with Woody Allen, certainly canceled,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.640]   but nevertheless, back when he was not canceled yet.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.080]   He made a movie called Annie Hall,
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.800]   in which, it's a self-depiction.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.680]   He's like a Larry David before Larry David was Larry David.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.120]   Neurotic, typical neurotic young Jew.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.800]   He's in Brooklyn, and he all of a sudden tells his mother
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.960]   he's not doing his homework anymore.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.360]   He refuses to do his homework.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.400]   His mother says, "Why?"
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.200]   Goes, "'Cause the universe is expanding,
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.120]   "and it keeps on expanding.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.040]   "Everything will rip apart,
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.940]   "and we'll never have anything in contact,
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.240]   "and everything is meaningless."
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.160]   I assume these are some of the topics we're gonna get to.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.580]   And she goes, "What are you talking about?
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.720]   "We're in Brooklyn.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.120]   "Brooklyn is not expanding."
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.800]   And that's true, Brooklyn is not expanding.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.640]   The solar system is not expanding.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.480]   Oftentimes, I get asked,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   "What is the universe expanding into?"
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.200]   That's one of my favorite questions.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.020]   "What is it expanding into?"
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.920]   And I say, it's actually an easy question,
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.320]   if you think about it.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.040]   You've seen your friend Elon.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:04.880]   He goes out into space.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   He's got a rocket, right?
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.840]   What's outside of the rocket?
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.120]   If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle,
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.440]   take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.960]   you know, sip in some Tang,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.080]   screw on the cover of it, what's in there?
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.100]   Is it empty?
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.420]   - That's just semantics, I guess.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.040]   - No, it's definitely not empty.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.800]   - So you step outside the rocket?
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.480]   - Yeah, you're in the vacuum of space,
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.320]   the quote-unquote vacuum of space.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.800]   - And there's no more liquid in it.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.720]   - There's no more liquid in it, no.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.680]   It's just a container, one cubic centimeter.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.840]   Let's make it simple.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.200]   One cubic centimeter of a box,
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.400]   and you take it out into space,
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.640]   outside the Falcon, whatever, right?
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.040]   What's inside that box?
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.100]   It's not empty.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.320]   There's actually, I'm gonna say,
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.460]   this is gonna set your friends,
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.140]   there's 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.900]   that we call the cosmic microwave background
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.580]   inside that box at any second.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.480]   - Okay, all right, hold on a second.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.320]   What?
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.340]   420, that's, I've heard of that number before.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.180]   All right, let's--
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.780]   - It used to be 69, but then they changed it.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.300]   - Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.940]   - In a millimeter box, it's 69.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.860]   - What are we talking about here?
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:16.460]   What's in the box?
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.020]   I'm gonna get, that's right.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.060]   Let's think outside the box.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.220]   No, we're thinking inside the box.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.380]   So if you have, every cubic centimeter
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.340]   of our observable universe is suffused with heat
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:28.520]   left over from the Big Bang, dark matter particles,
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.920]   there's a little ordinary matter in the universe,
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.020]   and every cubic centimeter,
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.700]   there's some probability to find a proton,
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.580]   a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.660]   There's actually an awful lot of neutrinos
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.320]   inside of that cubic centimeter.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.020]   Now, just imagine how many cubic centimeters
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.040]   there are in the universe.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:44.880]   It's enormous.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.200]   There's enormous numbers of particles in our universe.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.920]   It's a very rich universe.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.120]   But now let's zoom in on that box.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.000]   So now inside that box, there might be one,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.240]   let's say there might be one ordinary matter,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.000]   like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.160]   There might be a couple hundred neutrinos,
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:07.000]   and there'll be a couple hundred photons, as I said, 420.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.500]   What's between those guys?
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.120]   What's between the protons and the neutrinos
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.280]   and the photons?
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.080]   Just zoom in to a cubic micron now.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.400]   Imagine 420 things inside a box this big.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.960]   It's actually pretty empty.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.400]   They're just zipping around in there.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.480]   So between them, there's a lot of empty space.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.560]   - And this is outside the physics-based models of fields
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.400]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.720]   - Yeah, and dark fields. - Just asking the question,
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.560]   what is this emptiness?
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.880]   - What is the particle content in the universe
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.440]   in every cubic centimeter of the universe?
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.720]   - Outside of the 420.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.000]   So you have the 420.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:41.840]   - 420.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.480]   - They have some mass.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.320]   - Well, they have energy.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.160]   They're not mass.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:46.980]   Photons are not mass.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.820]   - Energy or mass. - That's why they don't
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.660]   bring suitcases.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.080]   You know that's true, right?
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.040]   Photons never bring suitcases with them
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.200]   'cause they're traveling light.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.520]   See, I don't even get to laugh at you.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.360]   Corny dad jokes.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.560]   Okay, you'll appreciate something.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.520]   - No, this is pretty good.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.880]   I'm laughing on the insides.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.920]   What's in the box?
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.800]   What's the 420?
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.440]   What's between the photons?
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.440]   - That's what space is.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.360]   That's what the universe is expanding into.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.200]   - Okay.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.680]   - Yeah, so that's the notebook
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.280]   on which the photons are written.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.120]   - That's beautiful work.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.440]   - But still, thank you.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.880]   Still, I understand this,
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.800]   but it's still uncomfortable that
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.680]   if the universe is expanding,
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.600]   that this thing is expanding.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.480]   The canvas is expanding.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.240]   It's very strange.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   'Cause if we were just sitting there still,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.720]   I guess if we're in Brooklyn, nothing's expanding.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.880]   So our cognition, our intuition about the world
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.720]   is based on this local fact that
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.520]   we don't get to experience this kind of expansion.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.400]   - Yeah, and that intuition leads us astray.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   But you know that gravity is the weakest
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   of the so-called four fundamental forces,
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.000]   and yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.800]   Gravity is, you know, we're being pulled
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.320]   towards the Andromeda Galaxy
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   at some enormous rate of speed
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.800]   because of its massive counter-gravitational force
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.640]   to the force we exert on it.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.680]   So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.960]   And because of that,
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.920]   we can think about these effects of expansion
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.520]   as the relationship between the, as you said,
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   the grid lines on the notebook, right?
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.680]   Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.120]   between those points, how far they are from each other,
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.360]   and those can change, those point distances can change
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.120]   over time because of the force of gravity.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.000]   So it's weak, and what we experience as gravity
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.560]   is the changing of those trajectories
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.860]   from being rectilinear to curvilinear.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.160]   That's what we experience as gravity.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.400]   You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.720]   about a bowling ball and a trampoline.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.840]   That's almost right, because it's actually,
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.120]   you have to visualize that now in four dimensions,
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.280]   like wrapping a trampoline at every point around the object,
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.400]   including on the sides,
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.240]   and it becomes very hard to visualize.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.080]   So a lot of people use that.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.100]   It's also a fraught analogy because you're using gravity,
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.420]   like the notion of gravity pulling something down
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.160]   to explain the notion of gravity.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.320]   So it's a little overburdening, the analogy.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.040]   - But okay, so you mentioned Barry Barish
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.320]   wrote the foreword to your book.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.400]   - Yeah.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.800]   - How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.760]   How do they, on the emotional level,
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.640]   how do they make you feel
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.960]   that they're just moving space-time?
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.160]   - Yeah, so gravitational waves were,
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.040]   the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.160]   discovery the first time, it was discovered twice,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.920]   indirectly by two men named Halston Taylor,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   and that was given my first year of graduate school.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.840]   The day I entered graduate school, almost,
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.720]   they announced these two guys won it,
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.160]   and the guy who won it did the work
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.560]   that would later win him the Nobel Prize when he was my age.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.080]   - Is this in the '40s?
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.760]   - This was, no, this is--
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.600]   - That was a joke.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.440]   - No, yeah, that was good, that was good.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.260]   - All right, thank you.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.100]   - I got it, I got it.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.800]   You know, to a cosmologist, age means nothing.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.880]   And to a tennis player.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.720]   - Not on Tinder.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.760]   (laughing)
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.600]   - That's right.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   - All right, sorry.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.440]   - Gravitational waves do fit in
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.040]   because what we're trying to do now
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.060]   is use the properties of gravitational waves,
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.200]   the analogous properties that they have to photons,
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.040]   that they travel at the speed of light,
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.120]   that they go through everything,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.640]   they can go through everything,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.600]   and that they're directly detectable.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.520]   We're using them to try to confirm
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.920]   if or if not inflation occurred.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.720]   So did inflation, the spark that ignited
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.120]   the fusion of the elements in the early part of the universe
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.440]   and the expansion, the initial expansion of the universe,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.560]   did that take place?
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.160]   There's only one way that cosmologists believe
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.480]   we could ever see that,
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.320]   through the imprint of these primordial gravitational waves,
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.380]   not these old newcomers like Barry's studies,
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.040]   the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us,
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.680]   a billion years ago,
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.280]   but we're seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.960]   ago during the inflationary epoch.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.480]   However, those we cannot build a LIGO
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.880]   and put it at the Big Bang.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.280]   So if you wanna measure,
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.440]   let's say you have the old time firecracker,
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.640]   let's say there's a firecracker,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.180]   and you wanna see if it went off
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.760]   in the building next door to you.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.560]   You can't see it, so you can't see the imprint of it,
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.040]   but you can hear it.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.400]   And what we're trying to do is hear the effect
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.720]   of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.320]   not by using a camera or even an interferometer
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.760]   like Barry used and his colleagues,
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.280]   but instead using the CMB, the light,
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.840]   the primordial ancient fossils of the universe,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.600]   the oldest light in the universe,
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.040]   we're gonna use that as a film, quote unquote,
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.080]   onto which gravitational waves get exposed.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.240]   - And hope you can,
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.720]   so what are the challenges there to get enough accuracy
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.840]   for the exposure?
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.960]   - So the signal, as I said,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.840]   so there's 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter,
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.280]   and there's a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.800]   However, what we're looking for
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.840]   is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.480]   We're not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.240]   We're looking for what its polarization is.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.800]   - And we'll go, let me just ask,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.960]   are you serious about the per cubic millimeter,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.040]   420 is the number?
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.880]   - Centimeter.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.240]   - Per cubic centimeter, 420 is the number.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.560]   I wonder if Elon knows this,
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.760]   and if he doesn't, he will truly enjoy this.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.640]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.360]   - Funding secured, excellent.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.080]   So I mean, this takes us to this story of heartbreak,
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   of triumph, that you described in losing the Nobel Prize.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.360]   So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.080]   Can you describe what bicep one and bicep two are?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.760]   Bicep three, perhaps, the instruments
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.400]   that can detect this kind of polarization?
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.920]   What are the challenges, the origin story, the whole thing?
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.600]   - Yeah, so, well, the origin story goes back again
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.160]   to like a father-son rivalry, it really does.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.440]   My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.160]   but he never won a Nobel Prize.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.000]   And some parents in America, they compete with their kids.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.440]   Oh, I was a football player in high school,
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.480]   I'll show you, and whatever, wrestling, whatever.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.840]   And some of us could be healthy too.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.280]   But with me and my dad, it wasn't super healthy.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.520]   Like we would compete and he was much more
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.080]   of a pure mathematician and I was an experimental physicist
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   so we had both different ideas
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.880]   in what was worth prioritizing our time.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.040]   But I knew for sure he didn't win the Nobel Prize.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.240]   And I knew I could kind of outdo him.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.800]   So I feel pretty venal and kind of minuscule
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.240]   kind of character-wise saying that.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.800]   - The only reason you could outdo him
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.680]   is because the Fields Medal is given every four years.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.920]   - And only if you're under 40,
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.000]   which he was no longer under 40.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.640]   - So he's working under much more limited conditions.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.480]   - That's right.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.760]   So even if I had, which, you know, spoiler alert,
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.120]   the book's called "Losing the Nobel Prize,"
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.520]   so I didn't do it.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.920]   But I wanted to do something big
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.440]   and I wanted to do something
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.080]   that would really just unequivocally be realized
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.800]   as a discovery for the ages, as in fact it was
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.340]   when we made the premature announcement
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.760]   that we had been successful.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.800]   - So you were, from the beginning,
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.480]   reaching for the big questions.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.400]   - That's all I cared about.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   - As an experimenter, you were swinging for the fences.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.640]   - That's all I wanted to do.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.680]   I felt like if it's not, you know,
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.560]   if it's worth spending perhaps the rest of my life on
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.320]   as a scientist, it better be damn well
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.540]   better be interesting to me, to carry me through,
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.960]   to give me the, you know, I always say,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.360]   passion is great when people say,
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.680]   "Oh, follow your passion," but it's not enough.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.840]   Passion's like the spark that ignites the rocket,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.480]   but that's not enough to get the rocket into space.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.800]   - So then you swung for the fences with BICEP1.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.720]   What is this?
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.200]   - So BICEP1 was born out of
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.480]   kind of interesting circumstances.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.840]   So I had gone to a Stanford University for a postdoc,
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.640]   so an academic Hunger Games--
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640]   - Stanford?
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.200]   - Stanford University, yeah, it's this small little school.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.160]   It's not like that technical college in Massachusetts
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.640]   that you're affiliated with.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.120]   But as I went there, I was working
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.720]   for a new assistant professor.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.920]   She had gotten there only a year before I got there,
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.360]   and she had her own priorities,
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.960]   the things that she wanted to do.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.440]   But I kept thinking in my spare time
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.040]   that I wanted to do something completely different.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.640]   She was studying galaxies at high redshift,
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.720]   and I wanted to study the origin of the universe
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.120]   using this type of technology.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.360]   And I realized, courtesy of a good friend of mine
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.260]   who's now at Johns Hopkins, Mark Heminkowski,
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.520]   that we didn't need this enormous Hubble telescope,
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.920]   we didn't need a 30-meter diameter telescope,
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.200]   we needed a tiny refracting telescope,
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.080]   no bigger than my head, less than a foot across.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.000]   And that telescope would have the same power
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.040]   as a Hubble telescope, sized telescope could have,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.440]   because the signals that we're looking for
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.720]   are enormous in wavelength on the sky.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.260]   They're enormously long, large area signals on the sky.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.160]   And if we could measure that,
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.440]   it would be proof, effectively,
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.880]   as close as you get to proof,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   there could be things that mimic it,
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.840]   but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.400]   Inflation being the signal
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.680]   originally conceived of by Alan Guth
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.200]   to explain why the universe
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.400]   had the large-scale features that it does,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.000]   namely that it has so-called flat geometry.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.080]   So there's no way to make a triangle in space,
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.320]   in our universe, that has three interior angles
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.220]   that do not sum to 180 degrees.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.560]   You can do that with spacecraft,
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   you can do that with stars,
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560]   you can do that with laser beams,
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   you can do that with three different galaxies.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.720]   All those galaxies, no matter how far you go,
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.800]   have this geometry, it's remarkable.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.840]   But it's also unstable, it's very unlikely,
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.920]   it's very seemingly finely tuned,
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.680]   and that was one of the motivations that Guth had
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.240]   to kind of conceive of this new idea called inflation,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.340]   1979, when he was a postdoc, also at Stanford, at Slack.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.360]   And he was trying to get a permanent job,
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.520]   I was trying to make my name for myself,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.560]   and so I realized I could do this,
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.800]   but I was also being paid by this professor at Stanford
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.160]   to do a job for her.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.780]   And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.460]   And then one day she couldn't take it anymore
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.960]   'cause I was sketching notebooks
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.280]   and planning his experiments,
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.160]   and I just, I wasn't, no, I actually--
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.080]   - You had big ideas in your mind,
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080]   you were planning big experiments,
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.000]   and that was difficult to work with on a small scale
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.280]   for like a postdoc type of situation,
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.320]   where you have to publish basic papers,
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.800]   deliver on some basic deadlines for a project,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.640]   all those kinds of things.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.720]   - Yeah, and support your advisors, paying,
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.120]   and she was paying me.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.520]   And so one day I came in,
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.960]   and it actually involved another friend of mine,
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.800]   an astronomer named Jill Tartar,
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.760]   one of the pioneers in the SETI science business
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.480]   of detecting extraterrestrials,
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.900]   which I assume you'd never like to talk about aliens,
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.920]   so I'm sure we won't get into aliens.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.720]   But Jill was visiting Stanford,
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.760]   and I was like, "I really wanna meet her,
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.600]   "can you introduce me?"
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.560]   And she said, "No, in fact, you're fired."
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.240]   My boss.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.840]   So I was like, "This is possibly the best thing
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.080]   "that could ever happen to me."
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.640]   I didn't know where it would lead or what happened to it,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.280]   but getting fired from this ultra-prestigious university
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.440]   turned out to be the path, I mean, literally,
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.200]   that brings me here today,
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.580]   in that, because of that,
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.840]   I ended up working for another person in Caltech,
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.920]   which is in Pasadena,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.600]   and she, my original boss, Sarah Church,
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.920]   she got me the job with her former advisor,
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.000]   a man by the name of Andrew Lang.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.760]   And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don't know,
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.680]   like, he's like a Steve Jobs or an Elon,
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.140]   charismatic, handsome, persuasive, idea man,
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.280]   not the guy always in the lab, you know, doing everything,
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.960]   but understood where things are going decades from now.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.200]   And he had been involved in an experiment
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.860]   that actually measured the universe was flat,
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.300]   very close to flat,
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.740]   along with a preceding experiment done at Princeton
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.480]   by Lyman Page and other collaborators.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.240]   - So the shape of the universe is flat.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.720]   - The geometry of the universe is flat.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.400]   - How did he do that experiment?
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.900]   - So he used the cosmic microwave background.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.360]   And so what I said is,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.440]   you have to look for triangles in the universe,
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.920]   so you can measure triangles on Earth,
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.120]   you can actually, it's hard to show
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.960]   that the Earth is curved,
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.200]   but you can show the Earth is curved
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.000]   using triangles, mountaintops, et cetera,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.880]   if you have an accurate enough protractor.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.320]   - Allegedly, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.560]   (laughs)
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.120]   God, you're like auto-canceling, this is great.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.640]   My ratings are gonna go up, man, this is gonna be great.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.560]   Take out the-- - If you want actual science,
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.240]   go listen to Brian.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.720]   If you want all of these conspiracy theories,
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.720]   or AKA the truth about flat Earth, listen to him.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.360]   And so what he used was the following triangle.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.280]   There are proto-galaxy-sized objects in the CMB.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.600]   The cosmic microwave background has these patches,
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.840]   and so you can make a triangle out of the diameter
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.760]   of one of these blobs of primordial plasma,
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.920]   the soup that constitutes the early universe,
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.080]   which is hydrogen, it's very simple material.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.280]   Understand hydrogen, electrons, and radiation,
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.720]   very simple, plasma physicist's son, understand it.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.680]   The diameter is one base of the triangle,
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.340]   and then the distance to the Earth is the other two legs.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:00.000]   So he measured, along with his colleagues at Caltech
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.160]   and University of Rome and that other group at Princeton,
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.200]   measured the angle, interior angle, effectively,
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.880]   very, very accurately, and showed that it added up
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.280]   to 180 degrees.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.080]   - Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.800]   Can you know where they,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.080]   could trace them back location-wise?
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.040]   - You can know where they are, but more than that,
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.520]   there's so many of these patches.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.680]   There are about one square degree on the sky.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.840]   The sky, you may know, a sphere has about
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.520]   44,000 square degrees in a sphere.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.960]   So there's literally 44,000 of these size patches
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.080]   over which he could do these kind of measurements
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.680]   to build up very good statistics.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.280]   That's not exactly how they do it,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.560]   or how they did it in this experiment called Boomerang,
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.840]   but they did measure very accurately
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.520]   the, what was called the first Doppler peak,
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.240]   or acoustic peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.320]   - That's, so the sphere has 44, approximately,
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.200]   44,000 square degrees.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.280]   So to cover a sphere, that's a very kind of
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.800]   important data collection thing
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.920]   when you're sitting on a sphere
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.840]   and you're looking out into the observable universe.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.920]   So there's a lot of patches to work with.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.080]   - Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the fast
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.560]   kind of algorithmic decomposition of spheres
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.040]   and machine learning in the early 2000s, still used today,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.400]   was created out of this field by data analysts
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.720]   using this thing called hierarchical equal area triangles
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.640]   called heel picks, is what it's called.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.400]   - And so it's just stitch all this stuff together,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.680]   and that's, and stitch it together very accurately.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.200]   - Yeah, get high statistical significance
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.000]   in order to reduce the statistical errors,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.680]   very clean signal and measurement device
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.320]   to reduce the systematic errors,
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.520]   those are the two predominant sources of error
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.720]   in any measurement, those that can be improved
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.920]   by more and more measurement, you know,
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.520]   you take more and more measurements of this table,
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.280]   you'll get slightly better each time,
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.880]   but you only win as the number of,
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.280]   one over the square root of the number of measurements,
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.600]   but the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.640]   So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.000]   Again, it's not exactly how they did it,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.960]   they also have to do a Fourier analysis,
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.020]   decompose that, do a power spectrum, filtration, windows,
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.720]   there's a lot of work that goes into it,
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.320]   image analysis, and then comparing that
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.960]   with cosmological parameters, very simple model,
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.960]   just six different numbers that go into a model
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.840]   that made a prediction, and one of those
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.800]   is the geometry of the universe pops out,
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.520]   and that is the universe has zero spatial curvature,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.960]   and that was called Boomerang.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.560]   So he had just come off of this.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.200]   Now, let me remind you, who was the first person
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.280]   to measure the curvature of the Earth?
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.920]   It's a guy named Aristophanes in the, you know, whatever,
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.960]   lived around Aristotle's time.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.080]   His name is in the history books.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.160]   So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like,
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.760]   he's like the next Aristotle, Aristophanes,
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   like, I just wanted to work for this guy.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.560]   You know, he clearly had this brand,
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.280]   he was about 40 at the time,
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.320]   California Scientist of the Year,
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.000]   I was sure he was gonna win a Nobel Prize for that,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.320]   and I knew that he, you know,
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.060]   so I went down to Caltech to give my job talk,
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.980]   and he said, you know, I love it, you got a job,
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.360]   and before I could even, you know,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.240]   before he finished the sentence, I said, I'll take it,
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.720]   you know, like, it was too good to be true,
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.640]   and I started working there at Caltech,
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.880]   and slowly but surely, 'cause Caltech's
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.240]   a rich, private university, at that time,
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.420]   run by a Nobel Prize winner by the name of David Baltimore,
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.400]   he just wrote us a check, Baltimore wrote us a check,
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.440]   and said, get started on this idea,
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.040]   and so we started coming up with the idea
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.240]   for what I later named BICEP,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.840]   Background Imaging Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.800]   which is kind of ironic,
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.160]   because we ended up measuring galactic polarization,
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.840]   we'll get to that in a minute,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.240]   but along the way, the idea was very simple,
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.800]   we're gonna make the simplest telescope
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.000]   you can possibly make, which is a refracting telescope.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.440]   Your eyes, you have two refracting telescopes in your head.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.560]   Only way, you know, forward is making things more complex,
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.200]   right, and when you make things complex in science,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.160]   you introduce the possibility for systematic errors,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.280]   and so we wanted to build the cleanest instrument,
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.780]   turns out the cleanest instrument you can build
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.000]   in astronomy is a refracting telescope.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.160]   We also had to, unlike that telescope, or Galileo's,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.220]   we had to use very sensitive detectors
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.160]   that were cooled less than 1/20th of the temperature
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.320]   of the cosmic background itself,
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.020]   which is the coolest temperature in the whole universe,
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.040]   so we had to cool these down to about .1
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.260]   or .2 degrees Kelvin, above absolute zero.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.680]   To do that, we needed to put it inside
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.560]   of a huge vacuum chamber and suck out all the air molecules
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.880]   and water molecules and take it to a very, very special
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.400]   place called the South Pole, Antarctica,
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.740]   from which I retrieved for you a patch,
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:25.880]   there it is over there.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.280]   So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.640]   - Bright, oh yeah.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.680]   - You fly down. - As somebody
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.080]   who was born in the Soviet Union,
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.520]   we obviously like to call it red,
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.760]   United States Antarctic Program,
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.520]   the National Science Foundation.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.400]   And the base is called
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.360]   the Amundsen-Scott South Polar Station.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.520]   So it's a little-known fact of geopolitics
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.280]   that whatever country occupies a region
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.920]   has ownership over it.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.320]   Now there is a treaty in Antarctica,
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.480]   you can't use it for military purposes,
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.280]   for mining, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   But I don't know if you know, but about 12 years ago,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.640]   Putin sent a submarine to the North Pole.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.240]   Now there's no land at the North Pole, right?
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.080]   So what did he do?
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.720]   He stuck it on the ocean underneath.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.760]   But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica,
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.200]   which was first reached about 110 years ago,
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.400]   first time in human history.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.160]   Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.960]   It means like no bears there,
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.640]   basically opposite of where polar bears are.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.520]   Arctic means polar bear, that's where, in Creek.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.880]   - Oh, did not know that, fascinating.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.760]   - So Antarctica means the opposite place of that.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.480]   So humans never even saw it,
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.680]   let alone went to the South Pole,
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.560]   which is kind of in the middle of that continent.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.280]   We went to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.760]   Texas, and there's no place like the South Pole or Chile.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.600]   Those are the two premier places on earth.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.680]   Of course, you'd like to go into space,
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.520]   there's no water in space.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.960]   - So it's not about cold, it's about dry.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.900]   - Exactly.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:57.720]   So that's why, for example, you can take this vodka
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.320]   and you can put it in this cup, right?
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.400]   And we can take it over to a microwave somewhere
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.240]   and heat it up.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.560]   After two minutes, the water's,
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.920]   three minutes, the water's boiling.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.760]   You can't touch it.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.020]   Take it from me, don't touch it.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.360]   But you can touch the mug and take it out
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.360]   if you want to, right?
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.200]   Why?
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.000]   Because the mug is totally bone dry.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.480]   But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules,
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.440]   'cause water molecules resonate exactly
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.000]   at these microwave frequencies.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.680]   So we don't want these precious photons,
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.620]   420 of them traveling per cubic centimeter,
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.560]   from the Big Bang itself to get absorbed
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.000]   in some water molecule in the earth's atmosphere.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.640]   So you take it to a place with the fewest number
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.440]   of water molecules per square centimeter of surface area,
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.920]   and that happens to be either Chile,
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.480]   or my other project, the Simons Observatory is located,
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.640]   or you take it to the South Pole.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.200]   We took it to the South Pole,
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.000]   and spent a couple of months of my life down there.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.200]   And it's like being on Hoth.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.040]   You know, it's like,
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.640]   it's a completely otherworldly environment.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.920]   Ice, planar, flat as a pancake.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.880]   You, like, and the buildings are built up on stilts.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.120]   They're built up, 'cause the snow
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.360]   will otherwise cover them over.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.760]   The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.920]   If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth,
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.320]   they yank 'em before you go down there.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.920]   If you have any issues with your appendix,
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.840]   they'll cut it out of you before you go down there.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.040]   The Russians at Vostok Base, not too far away,
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.880]   about 600 miles away.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.680]   The doctors there, there's a famous picture
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.940]   of one of 'em operating on himself,
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.720]   taking out his own appendix in the middle of winter
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.560]   by himself.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.640]   - It's a harsh condition.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.760]   Science in the harshest of conditions.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.080]   - On earth, at least.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.560]   And we go to those great lengths,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.240]   because it's a pristine environment
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.440]   to observe these precious photons.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.120]   And we built this telescope,
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.640]   and it weighs tens of thousands of pounds.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.600]   And it had to scan the sky, almost like, it's a robot.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.120]   I mean, it's scanning the sky almost unattended.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.080]   It needed, we have a guy who spends a year
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.760]   of his life down there, a girl who spends a year
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.960]   of their life down there.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.280]   They're called winter-overs.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.840]   They arrive in, sometimes as early as November,
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.200]   and they don't leave until the following December.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.680]   And we always joke, we'll pay you $75,000.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.400]   You just have to work for one night of your life.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.240]   That's all.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.360]   (laughing)
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.760]   It's a long night.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.840]   And what Bicep is, and I couldn't bring
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.600]   my polarized sunglasses here,
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.480]   so I brought these actual polarizers here.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.400]   So if you take this and put it in front
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.200]   of your telescope there, you have now made a polarimeter.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.120]   You have made a polarization-sensitive telescope.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.320]   Now you may not be able to immediately know
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.800]   how you would use such a thing,
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.380]   but one way to think about it, now take this guy
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.720]   and look at a light, look at a light source,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.600]   put one up to your eye, and now put the other one
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.040]   in front of it, anywhere, and now rotate them.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.560]   What happens to the light source?
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.440]   - Becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.120]   - Yeah, so that's called a quadrupolar pattern, right?
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.760]   So it's repeating, it goes bright, dim, bright, dim.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.240]   It rotates twice in intensity
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.680]   for every single physical rotation.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.520]   - Wow.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.680]   - And that's because of the property of the photon.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.520]   The photon is a spin-one field, but the polarization
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.040]   of light is the axis at which its electric field
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.280]   is oscillating.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   Its electric field is marching straight up
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.120]   and straight down, and so therefore,
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.120]   vertical polarization is the same as negative vertical
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.320]   polarization, and so you get the same pattern
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.200]   as you rotate two times for every one physical rotation.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.760]   It's just like a spin-two object.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.200]   So now if you put that in front of the telescope,
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.520]   you can do one of two things.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.880]   Now you're polarizing all the light that's going in
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.640]   because you have one of the polarizers,
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.080]   and then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.080]   You can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.000]   Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.200]   There's a crystal, it's called calcite.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.800]   This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Friedman.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.380]   This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes there,
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.800]   and tell me, what does it look like?
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.640]   - There's a...
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:56.440]   Like I could see everything twice.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.520]   - It's a double image.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.400]   - It's a double image.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.040]   - That is a special crystal that has two different indices
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.640]   of refraction.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.980]   So light emerging, which is unpolarized
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.240]   from the black ink, comes out,
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.800]   and it splits into two different directions.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.240]   And it could split even more if I made the crystal,
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.360]   give you my more expensive crystal, but that's all I have.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.200]   - What is the crystal with this kind of property called?
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.320]   - It's called calcite.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.040]   This is crystal, it's called birefringent crystal.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.420]   Bi means two, refringent means refracting.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.460]   So this is a special type of material
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:28.400]   that separates light based on its polarization.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.440]   - Pretty clean bi-signal.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.280]   - Yeah.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.560]   - It's cleanly two.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.400]   - Yeah.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.760]   - I'm seeing two very cleanly.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.640]   - It's very crisp, right.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.980]   So that's yours to keep with every time you host me.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:43.400]   Now, take the polarizer underneath your left hand.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.240]   - Yep.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.560]   - Put it on top of the crystal,
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.880]   and kind of move it back and forth.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.360]   - Wow.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.680]   This is incredible.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.240]   You can switch, as you rotate,
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.740]   you switch from one signal to the other.
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.660]   So one of the refractions to the other.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.500]   Whoa.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.880]   - So that is, now, you are analyzing the polarization,
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.200]   you are confirming the light comes out of the crystal,
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.160]   two different types of polarization.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.260]   And effectively, what we do,
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.000]   is we have those two things, if you like,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.700]   but working in the microwave,
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.100]   so our detector, that's where the cosmic photons
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.680]   are brightest in the microwave regime
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.880]   of the electromagnetic spectrum,
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.980]   and we're coupling that to a refracting telescope.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.400]   But your eyes are refracting telescopes,
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.480]   so you are a polarimeter right now.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.160]   The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization,
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.840]   but otherwise it mainly detects its intensity of light
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.360]   and the color, that's what we call color,
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.920]   and intensity of brightness.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.000]   - So you're devising an instrument
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.840]   that's very precisely measuring that polarization.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.900]   - Exactly.
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.880]   And doing so in the microwave region,
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:46.080]   with detectors not made of biological human retina cells,
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.800]   but of superconductors, and things called bolometers,
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.320]   and this has to be done at temperatures
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.080]   close to absolute zero, under vacuum conditions,
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.600]   one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.280]   - So why is it that this kind of device
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.080]   could win a Nobel Prize?
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.760]   - So when the CMB was discovered,
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.300]   it was discovered serendipitously.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.960]   There were two radio astronomers
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   working at the time at Bell Laboratories.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.420]   Now why would Bell Laboratories
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.080]   be employing radio astronomers?
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.520]   Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple,
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.280]   or it was like a think tank, or it was Google.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.120]   Let's say it was like Google.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.720]   Google has like Google X, it has this thing and that thing.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.660]   So they were working there,
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.280]   but imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.880]   Like they were actively recruiting,
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   why would they do that?
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.440]   Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.960]   was the first commercial satellite launch for communication.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.380]   And so Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone,
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.240]   part of AT&T and the early telephone company,
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:50.480]   later invent the first cell phone the year I was born.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.720]   And they would take that 1946,
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.960]   and they would take that telescope technology
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.460]   that radio astronomers had developed,
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.340]   and they would use that to see if they could improve
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.280]   the signal-to-noise of the satellites that they were seeing.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.020]   And they found they couldn't.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.720]   They found that they could not improve
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.220]   the signal-to-noise ratio
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.120]   of the first telecommunication satellite.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.080]   It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second modem.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.400]   And they were bouncing signals from the West Coast
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.320]   up to the satellite, bouncing it down,
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.360]   landing it in New Jersey of all places,
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.600]   in northern New Jersey, Holmdel, New Jersey.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.320]   And these radio astronomers couldn't get rid of the signal.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.080]   So they said, "Well, New Jersey's not far from New York.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.560]   "Let's see if the signal's coming from New York."
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.920]   Nope, not coming from New York.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.180]   "Let's see if it changes with the year.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.380]   "Maybe it's coming from the galaxy,"
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.680]   which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930-something.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.440]   - So not being able to reduce the signal
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.400]   or increase the signal-to-noise ratio,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.120]   the noise was-- - It was noise.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.680]   They knew the signal was right.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.080]   They couldn't get rid of the noise.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.800]   And there was excess noise over the model
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.080]   that had not only been predicted by them,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.800]   but had been measured by a previous guy,
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.520]   a guy by the name of Edward Ohm.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.360]   He measured the same signal,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.320]   found that there was this hiss of static,
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.660]   of radio static that he could not get rid of,
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.960]   that had a value of about three Kelvin.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.800]   So you can translate.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.480]   Remember I said, if you take a radio telescope
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.520]   and you have pointed at an object that's hot,
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.920]   the radio telescope's detector
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.080]   will get to the same temperature as the object.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.440]   It's a principle of radiothermodynamics.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.640]   So it's a really interesting thing.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.360]   So a thermometer, you can stick it into Jupiter
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.200]   from here on Earth.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.520]   It's amazing.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.520]   And so we in radio astronomy characterize our signal
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.600]   not by its intensity, but by its temperature.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.600]   So he found, this guy Edward Ohm,
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.240]   oh, there's this three Kelvin signal, I can't get rid of it.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.960]   It must be I did my error analysis wrong
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.320]   and I would give him an F
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.840]   if he was one of my first year students.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.520]   But he's just attributed to lack of understanding.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.760]   These other guys, Penzias and Wilson,
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.840]   who are also radio astronomers, they said,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.360]   no, let's build another experiment,
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.600]   put that inside of our telescope
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.000]   and do what's called calibration.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.600]   Inject a known source of signal every second
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.720]   that has a temperature of about four Kelvin
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.280]   because the signal that they were trying to get rid of
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.440]   is about three Kelvin.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.920]   And you wanna have it as close as possible
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.840]   to the pernicious signal as possible.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.320]   They did that once a second.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.560]   So they got billions of measurements,
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.840]   millions of measurements over the course
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.200]   of several months, years, and even by the end,
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.520]   millions of measurements for sure.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.320]   And they found they couldn't get rid of it either,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.400]   but they measured it was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.480]   - So how does having a four Kelvin source,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.600]   how does the calibration work?
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.560]   Just out of curiosity.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.400]   - It could be larger.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.280]   Imagine you're trying to calibrate the microphone.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.260]   You could do it with a really loud sound,
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.520]   but the gain would start to compress.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.960]   So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.400]   in every experiment that I've ever worked on.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.240]   And they only have a linear region over a very small region.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.340]   And you wanna keep it as linear as possible.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.120]   That means you want, if you're trying to get rid of,
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.040]   you're trying to compare like a voice
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.080]   and you're trying to compare that to a jet engine,
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.480]   it's not gonna be as easy on the amplifiers
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.960]   as getting a slightly, a gong or something, a violin.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.140]   - So the idea of the noise is present in both?
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.360]   - There's noise present in both.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.640]   And you measure, what they did is they made
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.520]   a separate measurement just of the calibration system,
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.160]   which they measured exactly very well.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.280]   Four Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.440]   That's a temperature that's not gonna change.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.360]   And it's certainly not gonna change
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.120]   over a time scale of one second.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.720]   And so they could compare unknown signal, known signal,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.840]   unknown signal, known signal, like a scale, like a balance.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.320]   So another way to think about it is like this.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.480]   You've seen these Libra kind of balances
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.360]   where you put two weights in a pan, right?
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.520]   What happens if you put like a one ounce weight
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.360]   on one side and a 20 kilogram weight?
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.040]   You don't get any measurement, right?
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:32.320]   You do get kind of a measurement if they're close in weight.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.780]   That's why they use four Kelvin.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:34.620]   - Got it.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:37.400]   But just to linger on the fact that there's a romantic
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.240]   element to the fact that you're arriving
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.200]   at the same temperature.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.040]   That's kind of fascinating.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.660]   And you're measuring stuff in terms of,
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.640]   you're measuring signal in terms of temperature
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.840]   at the source.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.680]   - Yeah.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.440]   - So you get to, I mean, there's something
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.200]   about temperature that's intimate.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.040]   - Yeah.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:52.880]   - It's cool.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.340]   - Yeah, especially since all life is basically
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.920]   conversion of energy and trying to control entropy,
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.600]   which is then related to thermodynamics exactly in that way.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.680]   And this is a very crucial kind of thing to do in science
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.640]   because they weren't looking for the signal.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.200]   They found it accidentally, these two scientists,
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.720]   Penzias and Wilson.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.140]   And I like to think that those kinds of discoveries
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.500]   are the purest in science.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.040]   Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said,
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.540]   like the most important reaction as a scientist
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.280]   is not Eureka, which means in Greek, as you know,
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.400]   I have found it.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.560]   No, he said, no.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.020]   He said like, that's weird.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.860]   Like that's a much better reaction or that's freaking cool.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.720]   Like that's a scientist, not like, oh, I found one.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.560]   Because-
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.380]   - Surprise.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.220]   - Yeah.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.060]   - Yeah.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:38.880]   - 'Cause if you find what you're gonna find,
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.000]   that's what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:43.960]   which is deadly.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.240]   And so, you know, as close to deadly as possible.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.960]   - So how does that take us to something
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.640]   that's potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.240]   - Ah, so Penzias and Wilson weren't looking for a signal.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.480]   They ended up discovering the heat left over
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:01.480]   from the fusion of helium from hydrogen, et cetera.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.040]   And that was a serendipitous discovery.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.800]   They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.640]   It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.840]   My reasoning is, what if you could explain
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.720]   not only how the elements got formed,
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.820]   but how the whole universe got formed
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.680]   and kill off every other model of science?
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.540]   So if that weren't enough, every scientist,
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.200]   you know, worth his or her salt,
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.760]   had told me and Andrew Lang and our colleagues,
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.780]   this is a slam dunk Nobel Prize, if you could do it.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.780]   Because it was really explaining, again,
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.580]   the stakes of this science is different
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.880]   than like super fluidity, plasma physics.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.400]   When you talk about the origin of the universe,
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.840]   it ties into everything.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.840]   It ties into philosophy, theology.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.440]   You realize if Paul Steinhardt is correct,
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.240]   that the Bible can't be correct.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.320]   In other words, what the Bible is correct now
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.080]   isn't falsified, if you like, if you believe it.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.820]   I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.800]   But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.560]   What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular?
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.520]   It would be more like the cosmology
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.820]   of Akhenaten and Egyptians,
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:07.100]   than the biblical Torah, Old Testament,
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.580]   if you will, narrative.
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.360]   So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.640]   And again, it's not an offense,
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.120]   'cause we need plasma physics.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.360]   We need every type of physics except maybe biophysics.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.600]   Like we literally use every branch of physics,
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.160]   and thermodynamics, superconductivity, quantum mechanics,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.840]   all that goes into our understanding of the instrument.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.680]   And even further, if you wanna understand the theory
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.720]   that predicts the signal that we purport to measure.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.640]   So I rationalized that if Penzias and Wilson
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.320]   won the Nobel Prize for this,
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.600]   if Hulson Taylor won the Nobel Prize
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.760]   for indirectly detecting gravitational waves,
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.320]   this is decades before LIGO,
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.360]   by me detecting gravitational waves indirectly,
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.800]   detecting how the universe began,
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.800]   detecting the origin of the initial conditions
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.560]   for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.040]   which won the Nobel Prize in 1983,
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.880]   these are like five Nobel Prizes, potentially.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.800]   For that reason, it seemed as close as you could possibly
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.240]   get to being a slam dunk, to outdo what my father did,
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.160]   to do really this impossible.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.720]   And at that time, Lex, again, it sounds weird,
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.480]   because people are like, "Oh, you don't really,
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.780]   "you still want the Nobel Prize, you're still greedy.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.120]   "And look, you wrote another book about it."
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:19.960]   And I always joke, I'm like,
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.280]   "Well, if you wanna see if I'm a hypocrite,
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.780]   "just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.560]   "And if I accept it, then I'm a hypocrite."
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.200]   - Wait, well, we'll get to your current feelings
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.540]   on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrite and so on.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.280]   But, so there's this ambition, let's say,
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.520]   this device, this kind of signal could unlock
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.240]   many of the mysteries about the early universe.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.200]   And so there's excitement there.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.020]   So let's take it then further.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.200]   I mean, there's a human story here of a bit of heartbreak.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:54.520]   Not only was this possibly worth a Nobel Prize,
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.400]   if the Nobel Prize was given, you were excluded
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.480]   from the list of three that would get the Nobel Prize.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.480]   So why were you excluded?
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.560]   Maybe that's a place to tell the story of BICEP2.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.160]   - Yeah, so BICEP2, like iPhones,
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.000]   or I know you're an Android fanboy,
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.440]   but every year, they get a little bit better.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.000]   They get more megapixels, they get more optics,
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.600]   triple X zoom, whatever, okay, right?
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.480]   We upgraded our detectors as well.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.200]   The initial detectors were based
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.840]   on what are called semiconductors.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.020]   They have certain properties that make them
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.240]   very difficult to replicate at scale.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.880]   And we wanted to make them into superconductors,
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.320]   which had a virtue that you could then mass produce them.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.640]   Why superconductors?
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.160]   Well, again, we're measuring heat.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.160]   So one thing about a superconductor
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.320]   is that it transitions from some finite resistance
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.000]   to zero resistance over a very short span
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.340]   of temperature range.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.280]   That means you can use that very short span dependency
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.840]   as an accurate and sensitive and precise thermometer.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.960]   And so my brilliant colleagues around the world
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.020]   in this case, Jamie Bach,
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.600]   and nowadays Suzanne Staggs at Princeton,
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.920]   they are just exquisitely making these sensors,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.800]   tens of thousands of them.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.680]   The initial BICEP1 instrument,
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.440]   of course, we just call it the BICEP,
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.200]   that only had 98 detectors.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.540]   Simon's Observatory is gonna have 100 times more
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.740]   just in one of our four telescopes.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:21.680]   We're gonna have 60,000 detectors operating full-time
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.460]   at 0.1 degree above absolute zero
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.440]   in the Atacama Desert, we'll get there.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.160]   But in the case of getting back to what BICEP did,
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.560]   we upgraded, made BICEP2.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   In January 2010, we had just installed
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.240]   in the exact same location at the South Pole
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240]   in the same building,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.280]   which is ominously called the Dark Sector Laboratory, DSL,
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.940]   still operating to this very day.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:54.280]   We installed a new receiver on the same platform as before.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.960]   Had very similar, identical optics, cryogenics,
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.120]   vacuum, everything, except it went from 98 detectors
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.440]   to 512 detectors, so almost an order of magnitude.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.480]   Very substantial upgrade.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.780]   And it had certain other features
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.520]   that made it even more powerful,
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.940]   but then just a naive factor of five.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.640]   And then we started observing with that,
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.080]   and we knew we'd have years to go,
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.280]   and maybe we'd never see anything.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.520]   Again, we're looking for these tiny little reverberations
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.200]   in the fabric of space-time produced close to the origin
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.000]   of the universes we could ever get to.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.320]   So I was playing a role in that.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.160]   Obviously, it had upgraded my version of the original idea
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.580]   that I had had for BICEP along with Andrew Lang.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:37.120]   And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley,
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.960]   and I got a call from Andrew Lang's,
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.720]   or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang's thesis advisor,
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.040]   Paul Richards, at UC Berkeley.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.880]   And he said that Andrew was dead.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.000]   He had taken his life by suicide.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.280]   And this is a man,
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.480]   and I had already lost my father at this point,
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.720]   in 2010, but he was like a father figure to me, Andrew.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.600]   He would give me advice on marriage,
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.480]   on how I should be with my kids,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.280]   and what was the most important way
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.640]   to move through the academic ladder.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.160]   Again, he was preternaturally suited
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.520]   to win the Nobel Prize.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.760]   Everyone always thought he would win it.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.560]   If he were alive, he still could win it.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.040]   In fact, his wife, or his ex-wife, won it,
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.720]   Frances Arnold, in 2018.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:20.480]   And it was this power couple,
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.720]   and it destroyed me for a long time,
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.400]   because he was just this magical person.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.400]   I mean, I couldn't conceive of my career, my life,
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.440]   even like these aspects of raising kids
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.000]   and being married without him.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   And to do it in that way, it felt like,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.560]   again, he's got kids,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.240]   and I feel terrible for them, obviously,
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.440]   but it did feel like a betrayal.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.640]   I mean, I'm just being honest with you.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.200]   It felt like, why the F did you not reach out?
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.680]   I thought we were close, and I couldn't.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.800]   I told him everything,
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.400]   and I felt like he had told me everything.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.440]   And now he was gone,
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.960]   and then inevitably, we had to keep running the instrument.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.800]   I mean, there's millions of dollars invested,
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.720]   careers at stake, young people working tremendously hard,
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.680]   and then here we were,
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.360]   and who's gonna take over the lead?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.920]   He was the lead of the project at Caltech.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.160]   And then it turned out that the other collaborators
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.680]   with whom I had been working for years
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.200]   and shared a lot of ups and downs with as well,
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.080]   they had decided to form a collaboration
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.480]   in which I was no longer the principal investigator.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.560]   I was no longer one of the co-principal investigators
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.920]   as I was on BICEP1.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.580]   So I continued on BICEP1 as the co-leader of it,
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:31.040]   but not on BICEP2.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.640]   And obviously, that was pretty painful.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.280]   - This is all happening at the same time
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.360]   as you lose this father figure.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360]   Now there's this kind of,
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.200]   this one betrayal in a way,
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.920]   and then there's another,
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.800]   or something that feels like a betrayal.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.840]   - Yeah, and he had kind of been the only one
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.800]   looking out for my interest in the new experiment.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.440]   I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego,
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.200]   and there were other postdocs in the mix,
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.240]   all of whom would come there to work with him
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.720]   to get the approbation that would then lead
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.780]   to their careers taking off as it did for mine.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.000]   And so there was a competition.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.320]   I mean, science is not free from egos and competition
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.880]   and desires, rightfully or wrongfully,
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.440]   for credit and attribution.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.000]   - Was he the source of strength and confidence
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.040]   for you as a scientist, as a man?
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.280]   I mean, we're kind of alone in this world.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.480]   When you take on difficult things,
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.760]   we often kind of grasp at a few folks
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.300]   that give us strength.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.140]   - Yeah.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:37.320]   - Was he basically your only source of strength
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.260]   in this whole journey?
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:41.840]   Like primarily in terms of like this close knit?
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.600]   - As a scientist, there were really two.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.080]   There was one, this Russian cosmologist,
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.520]   Alexander Polnareff, who thankfully is very much alive.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.040]   He was at Queen Mary University.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.520]   Now he's retired.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.000]   He was kind of a theoretical, cosmological father to me.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.320]   And then Andrew was this counterpoint that was teaching me,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.560]   you need to have a brand as a scientist.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.000]   Every scientist has a brand,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.620]   and some of them don't protect it.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:07.840]   Some of them don't burnish it.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.980]   But some of the skills about being a scientist,
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:11.520]   we don't teach our students,
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.520]   involve how do you cultivate a scientific persona?
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.760]   And he was the exemplar for that.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.560]   In addition to being the avuncular,
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.580]   father figure type character,
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.480]   that really was the person I would talk to.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.360]   I had issues with, when I had issues with my own students,
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.680]   and he would tell me how those were,
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.960]   and he would tell me his misgivings
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.320]   about people that he worked with,
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.520]   or things in his personal life.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.160]   And it was devastating.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.680]   But again, like who the hell am I?
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.240]   I'm not his kid.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.400]   His kids lost father.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.720]   So I feel guilty talking about it in that sense,
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.440]   but it's just a reality.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.600]   - Well, there is something that's not often talked about
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.000]   is people who collaborate on scientific efforts.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.680]   I mean, that's, I don't, again, don't wanna compare,
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.480]   but sometimes when the collaborations are truly great,
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   it sounds similar as when veterans talk about
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.360]   their time serving together.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.920]   There's a bond that's formed.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.960]   So like comparing family and this kind of thing is,
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.920]   you know, it's not productive,
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.120]   but the depth of the bond is nevertheless real,
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.160]   because you're taking on something,
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.760]   you're taking on the impossible.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.520]   You're trying to achieve something,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.960]   sort of like there's this darkness,
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.640]   this fog of mystery that we're all surrounded by,
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.480]   which is what the human condition is.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.840]   And you are like grasping at hope
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.720]   through the tools of science.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.960]   And you're doing that together with like a confidence
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.040]   you probably should not have,
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:51.480]   but you're boldly pushing through.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:56.480]   And then for him to take his own life,
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.160]   it can ask you about this kind of moment that combined,
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.860]   I don't wanna say betrayal,
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:05.880]   but perhaps the feeling of betrayal
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.320]   that BICEP2 kind of goes on without you,
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.480]   even though you're part of it,
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   you're not part of the leadership group.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.300]   Can you describe those low points?
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.840]   Was there a depression?
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.000]   Or was there a crumbling of confidence?
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.280]   - Yeah, I mean, it was so wrapped up
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.240]   with my identity as a person, you know,
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.040]   like there's only a few different ways to have identity,
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.800]   and you know, unless you're unhealthy psychologically.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.120]   One of them for scientists is often that they're a scientist
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.160]   and that sometimes is their primary identity.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.920]   Now I've got other, you know, I'm a husband and father,
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.840]   but you know, at that time that was my identity.
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:48.100]   So to have that kind of taken away,
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.000]   it, you know what, it reminded me of being, you know,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.840]   kind of adopted in a sense, like the one who created me
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:58.360]   or that I had played a role in my life,
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.800]   that he abandoned me in the sense,
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.640]   it felt like these people are abandoning me.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.320]   And the only thing I'd correct about the analogy
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.080]   that you use is like in the war,
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.680]   they're all working, you know, for common good.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.600]   It's not like, I wanna be, get the most kills.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.360]   I compare it more to like a band,
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.400]   like think about the Beatles, you know, and what they did.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.780]   And then they like, you know, they ripped apart
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.220]   because of egos, credit, they had solo careers,
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:24.120]   they had, you know, relations of their intimates
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.340]   and so forth.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.800]   And there it's not only for the common good.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.160]   There is more of a zero sum aspect.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.340]   Like I would say, science is not,
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.920]   science is an infinite game.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.800]   You can't win science.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.400]   You never get to the, oh, we won science.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.880]   And even the Nobel Prize, they don't feel like,
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.720]   oh, we're done.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.320]   They feel like a lot of times they're imposters,
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.960]   even to that day.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.240]   However, science is made up of a lot of, lot of,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.060]   lot of finite games where there is only one winner
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:49.960]   for tenure.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.240]   There is only three winner,
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.840]   are only three winners for the Nobel Prize.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.000]   And because of that, I think it's heterodox
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.160]   and it's very confusing, especially there's no guide.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.760]   I never got a guide how to be a professor,
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.520]   how to teach, how to lead a research group,
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.000]   how to deal with the death of an advisor,
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.560]   how to deal with an unruly graduate student or two.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.920]   So we're all like reinventing it,
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.400]   which is kind of ironic and insane if you think about it.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.320]   'Cause the academic system that I am a part of
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.860]   and you are a part of is a thousand years old.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.120]   Dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.200]   1088 or so, first universities were established.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.560]   And very little has changed.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.880]   There's some guy or gal scratching a rock
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.920]   on another piece of rock and lecturing in front.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.800]   There's only one better aspect nowadays
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.880]   is that back then, the students could go on strike
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.240]   if they didn't like the professor
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.920]   and then he or she wouldn't get paid.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.160]   Probably mostly it was he's back then.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.400]   Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.800]   by tenure, so okay.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.080]   But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   getting pulled out from underneath me
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.400]   because he was like my consigliere.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.000]   He was a guy I sought counsel and counseled me
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.440]   and he's dead and I felt like there is no one
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.520]   who's gonna honor the agreements that we had.
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.080]   And he was a very soulful person.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.560]   He was so much better at being a scientist
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.400]   than I could ever be.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.920]   And just the loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:17.760]   And I thought, oh, it's so sad
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.920]   'cause he could have won the Nobel Prize.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.400]   I don't think like that anymore.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.160]   First I think about his kids.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.480]   Felt at first, now there goes my chance
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.440]   at winning a Nobel Prize and hence the title of the book
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.080]   was like, I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.960]   It also means that there's parts of the Nobel Prize
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.120]   that have to be done away with.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.400]   It's a double entendre.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.440]   We need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.520]   to help science out.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.960]   We can talk about that a different time.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:44.240]   But in the context of now thinking back on it,
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.160]   that was such a minuscule part of it
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.200]   because let's say he did win the Nobel Prize
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.960]   or I did win the, or any of us did.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.240]   Would that have changed anything?
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:55.080]   Would that have brought anything back?
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.760]   It's so, we say it's like vanity, it's futility.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   And I just, for me, the Nobel Prize is like,
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.080]   I don't wanna say it's insignificant
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.640]   'cause obviously it has a lot of power and it has influence.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.480]   And I went back, I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show,
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.000]   I'm gonna name drop, okay?
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.440]   And he prepares, he prepares like a surgeon
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.400]   before doing surgery when he goes on a talk show.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.840]   So you see him going on Colbert Report,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.320]   you think, oh, they just have a banter,
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.400]   he's just naturally gifted.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.080]   No, he said, no, no, no.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.760]   You say that, you're undermining what he does.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.280]   What he does is he goes back,
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.680]   he watches the last month of Colbert Reports
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.720]   or whatever it's called, late show.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.520]   And he says, how long does Steven pause between questions?
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.240]   How long in the news cycle does he go back?
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.200]   What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.600]   So I took Neil and I did that for you.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.680]   And I look back, how many times has Lex mentioned
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.200]   the words Nobel and Prize?
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.640]   And I put it into Google Ngram
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:55.040]   and out came exactly the same number of times
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.960]   as show episodes as of this moment.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:01.680]   So you've said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.560]   - Yeah, I mean, it is so strange as a symbol
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.000]   that kind of unites this whole scientific journey, right?
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:17.000]   It's both sad and beautiful that a little prize,
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.520]   like a little award, a medal, a little plaque,
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.320]   they'll be most likely forgotten by history completely.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.240]   Some silly list.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.120]   It's somehow a catalyst for greatness.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:35.560]   It resulted in you doing your life's work.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.040]   The dream of it.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.680]   - Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.080]   I can't necessarily counterfactually state
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.480]   that that would have happened.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.000]   So no, it definitely has a place.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.280]   And for me, it is valuable to think about it.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.800]   But the level of obsession that academics have about it
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.480]   is really, I think it is almost unbalanced
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:00.080]   becoming unhealthy.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.240]   And again, I make no truck
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.760]   with the winners of the Nobel Prize.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.120]   Obviously, now I've had 11 on the show.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.480]   And to think about the one rule.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.680]   So by the way, right after the denouement of the story,
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.440]   which I'll get to in a bit,
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.220]   how our dreams went down to dust and ashes,
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.440]   I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.400]   to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.360]   So the one that I theoretically
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:31.440]   could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually,
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.320]   they asked me to nominate.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.200]   Now imagine if I ask you, Lex, you say, "Brian,"
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.080]   instead of me inviting myself on the show,
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.520]   if you say, "Brian, would you like to come
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.040]   "on the Lex Friedman podcast?"
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   I say, "You know what, Lex?
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:42.880]   "You know that guy, Rogan?
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.000]   "I think you might have heard him.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.600]   "Can you introduce him to me?"
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:47.720]   You imagine how that would feel.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:50.000]   Like you'd be like, "Ah, you know, I'm humiliated."
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.280]   So I was asked to nominate the winners.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:53.360]   And the one rule that they say,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.800]   of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated,
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.720]   there's only one rule that they maintained.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.960]   In other words, he said one person can win it
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:02.920]   for something they discovered in the preceding year
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.080]   that had the greatest benefit to mankind.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.880]   Made the world better, right?
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.480]   None of that was mentioned in the letter.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.320]   It said many people can win it for work done long ago.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.000]   They didn't mention anything in the letter to me
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.680]   signed by the Secretary General.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.920]   Nothing about benefiting mankind.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.200]   They said, "Just one thing, can't nominate yourself."
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.160]   So none of these guys nominated themselves.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.800]   - Actually, little known fact,
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.400]   they sent that exact letter just to you.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.920]   That rule was created just for you.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.800]   - That's called the Keating Correlate, yes, exactly.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.800]   - Just to like-- - Good for them.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.600]   - Rub it in.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600]   I mean, in this particular case,
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.320]   of course, there's some weird technicality or whatever,
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.680]   but in this particular case,
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.160]   it's kind of a powerful reminder.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.000]   - Yeah, no way.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.360]   - That the Nobel Prize leaves a lot of people behind.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.360]   And there's stories behind all of that.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.560]   - Yeah, I mean, here's a good example.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.080]   Again, this is my friend, Barry Barish.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.240]   He's become like a mentor and a friend.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.040]   He wrote the foreword to my book, "Into the Impossible."
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.080]   He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died,
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.080]   and he admits it, and he said it.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.280]   And actually, it's funny with him,
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.480]   because I've heard you talk very rhapsodically
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.080]   and lovingly and romantically with Harry Cliff,
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.320]   and a wonderful podcast with him, by the way,
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:21.200]   about the LHC and how wonderful it is,
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.520]   and how in that, we were about to build
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.000]   the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas,
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.400]   and it didn't get built,
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.280]   and it got canceled by Congress, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.200]   And I say to Barry,
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.960]   that was the best thing that ever happened to you.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.240]   And he's like, "What the hell are you talking about?"
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.800]   I'm like, if that didn't get canceled,
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:39.400]   first of all, even though it did get canceled,
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.840]   the Europeans went on to build it themselves,
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:44.240]   saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars,
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.040]   and we wouldn't have learned anything
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.440]   really substantially new,
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.160]   as proven by the fact that, as you and Harry talked about,
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.720]   nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.560]   has come out.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.200]   And actually, he's had a recent paper,
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.520]   but it's been an upper limit,
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.800]   along with his collaborators, an LHCb experiment
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.680]   that I'm gonna be talking with him about.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.840]   But the bottom line is,
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.080]   it was really built to detect the Higgs.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.200]   So the SSC, for twice as much money,
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.640]   would have sucked up Barry's career,
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:08.760]   and he would have been working on that.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.720]   Maybe not.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.920]   And then he would never have worked on LIGO,
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.960]   and then he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, right?
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.440]   So you look at counterfactual history.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.960]   That's not actually a big stretch, right?
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.080]   If the SSC had still gone on, he would have worked on it,
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.840]   'cause he was one of the primary leaders of that experiment.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.400]   Second thing, if,
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.280]   imagine the following thing had happened.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.440]   They won the Nobel Prize, because in September 2015,
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.320]   they detected unequivocal evidence
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.880]   for the in-spiral collision of two massive black holes,
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.180]   each about 30 times the mass of the sun,
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.880]   leaving behind an object
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.160]   that had just less than 60 solar masses behind.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.760]   So one solar mass worth of matter,
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:49.000]   got mass, got converted to pure gravitational energy.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.220]   No light was seen by them.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.120]   This particular date, September 14th, 2015, okay?
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:59.920]   That explosion, because of the miracle of time travel
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.160]   that telescopes afford us,
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:05.840]   that actually took place 1.2 billion years ago
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.240]   in a galaxy far, far away.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.880]   They actually don't know which galaxy it took place in,
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.840]   still, and they never will, okay?
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.640]   If that collision between these two things,
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.220]   which have probably been orbiting each other
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.540]   for maybe a million years or more,
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:20.180]   if that had occurred 15 days earlier,
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:23.240]   Barry wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, because--
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:26.040]   - It's hilarious to think that there's one human
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.000]   that won the Nobel Prize,
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.200]   because two giant things collided.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.120]   - A billion, 200 million years ago,
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.320]   and if it had happened 18 days, 20 days, 30,
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.260]   because that was the deadline
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:40.720]   for the Nobel Prize to be announced,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.220]   they announced the findings in February,
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:45.320]   but you have to nominate the winners in January.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:48.060]   So I could have nominated them up until January 30th,
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:49.800]   but they didn't announce anything,
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:51.000]   and there were just rumors,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]   and so he didn't,
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.640]   but the reason that he wouldn't have won it,
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.560]   'cause there was another guy who was still alive,
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.560]   considered to be the founder and father
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.080]   of three of the three fathers,
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.760]   Ray Weiss, who did win it, Kip Thorne, who did win it,
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.160]   and the third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Drever,
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.760]   who passed away, again, he was alive in 2016,
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.120]   he died in the middle of 2017,
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.600]   and then he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.560]   - And here we are, several billion of hairless apes
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.780]   that strangely wear clothing,
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:24.780]   celebrated three other clothed hairless apes
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:30.440]   with a medal, with one particular element,
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.000]   and then they made speeches in a particular language
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.180]   that evolved-- - They bent down
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:38.800]   to get those medals in front of another guy
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.800]   who wears even fancier clothes,
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:42.680]   who is the king of Sweden.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.920]   - And then they got some free food afterwards.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.020]   - They get some reindeer meat, that's right.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:48.540]   - Okay, excellent.
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:53.040]   Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example,
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.100]   what happened to you in terms of Bicep 2?
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:00.960]   - I wanna kinda speak at a high level
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.520]   about a particular thing I observed.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.880]   So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast,
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.040]   I was just listening to the podcast,
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.520]   I'm a huge fan of podcasts in general.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:14.520]   And it also coincided with my entry into grad school
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:17.600]   and this whole journey of academia.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.680]   So grad school, getting my PhD,
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:21.560]   then going to MIT and then Google,
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.720]   and then just looking at this whole world of research.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:31.540]   What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:37.360]   is that he celebrates others, like he promotes them.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.880]   He gets genuinely, and I now know this
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.600]   from just being a friend privately,
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.600]   he genuinely gets excited by the success of others.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:52.720]   And the contrast of that to how folks in academia
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.680]   often behave was always really disappointing to me.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:00.700]   Because the natural, just on a basic human level,
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.940]   there is an excitement, but the nature of that excitement
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:08.620]   is more like, I'm happy for my friend,
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:11.380]   but I'm really jealous and I want to even outdo them.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.940]   I wanna celebrate them, but I wanna do even better.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.000]   So that's even for friends.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000]   So there's not a genuine, pure excitement for others.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.340]   And then couple that with just the,
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:28.220]   you now as a host of a popular podcast know this feeling,
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:31.180]   which is like, there's not even a willingness
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:35.260]   to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:40.020]   People in academia are often best equipped,
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:43.360]   technically in terms of language, to celebrate others.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:48.040]   They understand the beauty, the full richness
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.980]   of why the cool idea is as cool as it is.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:53.180]   And they're in the best position to celebrate it.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.020]   And yet there's a feeling that if I celebrate others,
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.880]   they might end up on the cover of Nature or whatever,
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.740]   and not me. - It's a zero-sum game.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.880]   - They turn it into a zero-sum game.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.500]   The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration to me
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:12.060]   and many others is that it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:15.300]   And forget money and all those kinds of things.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.300]   I think there's a narrative told that academics are this way
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.220]   because there's a limited amount of money,
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:24.540]   and so they're fighting for this.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.500]   I don't think that's the reason it's happening this way.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:32.900]   I think you can have a limited amount of money.
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.860]   The battle for money happens in the space of proposal.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.360]   There's networking, there's private stuff.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.820]   Public celebration of others, and just actually,
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:46.180]   just how you feel in the privacy of your own heart
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.540]   is not have to do anything with money.
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:51.980]   It has to do with you having a big ego
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:55.020]   and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the journey
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.500]   that we're all on.
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.500]   And there's folks like Joe Rogan,
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:01.780]   who in the comedian circles is also rare,
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:05.020]   but he inspired all these other comedians to realize,
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:07.100]   you know what, it's great to celebrate each other.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:10.340]   We're promoting each other, and therefore the pie grows
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:12.860]   'cause everybody else gets excited about this whole thing,
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.100]   and the pie grows.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.940]   Right now, the scientists, by fighting,
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:20.020]   by not celebrating each other, are not growing the pie,
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:22.180]   and now because of that,
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:24.180]   sort of science becomes less and less popular.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.660]   - It's a flywheel, exactly.
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:26.740]   No, and I wanna point out two things.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.900]   One is that I remember you went on Joe's show
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:31.400]   maybe a couple of years ago,
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.480]   and then he gave you a watch.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.260]   He gave you like a Rolex, right?
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:37.540]   And I tweeted to you, and I think it's--
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.900]   - Omega. - Omega, sorry.
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:40.340]   Okay, fine.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.440]   The watch that went to the moon,
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.640]   which we will get to in a bit.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.220]   I don't think he could give you what I gave you,
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.060]   though, by the way.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:47.880]   (laughing)
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.540]   And we'll get to what that final gift package is for you.
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.340]   - And by the way, I also wanted to mention,
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:55.220]   because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset,
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:57.100]   and you should definitely go on Joe Rogan.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.660]   And we had this conversation with him,
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.160]   'cause I was like, when I was,
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:06.140]   so moving to Austin, and had a conversation,
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:07.580]   like, don't you think it's weird
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:10.140]   if we have the same guests at the same time or whatever?
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.620]   He's like, fuck that.
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:14.620]   I want you to be more successful than me.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:18.060]   I want, he truly wants everybody,
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:19.900]   like, especially people close to him,
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.060]   to be more successful.
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:23.180]   Like, there's not even a thought, like--
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.260]   - But you know why he does,
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:25.100]   and this is what I tweeted to you,
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.380]   and one of the few things I think you have retweeted
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:28.220]   that I sent you.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:31.060]   I said, someday you're gonna give that to somebody.
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.580]   And today I wanted that to be me.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:35.620]   No, no. (laughing)
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.460]   Joe's Omega.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:40.960]   No, but the point is, he sees in you that same grandiosity,
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.020]   that same genuine spirit graciousness.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:43.860]   And I think that's true.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.460]   And you do do something very rare.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:47.260]   I don't wanna turn this into too much of a love fest,
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:49.980]   but I do wanna say, even back to Andrew,
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:52.780]   who I've almost been hagiographic about,
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.220]   just treating him like a saint.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:55.220]   He said to me the same thing,
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.980]   and in a moment of peak, said like,
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:00.560]   goddammit, I have to train these guys
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.460]   and women that work for me
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:04.220]   so that they can be better than me,
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.320]   so that they can go out and compete with me
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:09.820]   for the same limited amount of funding from the effing NSL.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.060]   That wasn't who he was.
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.060]   That was just an expression.
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:16.460]   Like, I am doing something which is fundamentally,
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:17.360]   but you know what?
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.620]   When you have kids, hopefully,
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.900]   please God, you will someday.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:22.380]   'Cause I think, and I hope we can get
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:26.060]   to talk about that later, but part of investment
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:28.580]   and part of doing something when you have a kid,
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:30.460]   like you can get married.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.460]   You can marry someone 'cause she's rich or he's rich.
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:35.100]   You can marry someone 'cause they're good looking
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.300]   or he's good looking.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.940]   You can marry for all these different reasons
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:39.980]   that are ultimately selfish.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:41.860]   There's no way you can have a kid and be selfish.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.060]   Nobody says, "Oh, you know what?
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.900]   "I really want this thing that's three feet tall,
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:47.000]   "that doesn't speak English, that craps on my floor,
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.440]   "that wakes me up all hours of the night,
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.060]   "that interferes with my love life."
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:52.120]   Nobody says that 'cause it doesn't benefit you
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:53.060]   for months and months.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:55.380]   A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me,
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:58.100]   does a lot of my solo videos, he's having his first kid.
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:59.300]   He's like, "What do I do?"
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:00.400]   'Cause it always gets stupid if I,
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.660]   "Oh, catch up on sleep now."
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.500]   Like, yeah, I'm gonna store sleep in my sleep bank.
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.700]   I don't think Huberman and you talked about that, right?
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.100]   You can't do that, that's stupid.
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:10.840]   What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby,
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.820]   let the mother relax.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.060]   Like, in other words, do the things,
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:16.380]   and this really relates back to what Aristotle once said.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.900]   Aristotle once said, "Why do parents love kids
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:20.780]   "more than kids love parents?"
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.740]   As much as you love your dad and your mom,
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.580]   they still love you more.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:27.140]   And because you love that which you sacrifice for.
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.780]   Here's a proof.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:31.020]   I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.180]   Some with severe, one of my uncles,
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.820]   my uncle on the Keating side had severe,
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:37.300]   what they called mental retardation,
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:39.260]   now it's probably has a different name.
[01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:42.800]   That, out of the nine other brothers and sisters,
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.400]   he was their favorite.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.920]   'Cause they had to sacrifice so much for him.
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:49.080]   And I think of that, in the small case,
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.160]   like Joe's kind of mentoring you or whatever,
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.120]   and you're gonna mentor someone else.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:54.380]   You love that which you sacrifice for.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:56.480]   Sacrifice is reduction of entropy,
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:59.520]   it's storing and investing, and you wanna protect that.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:02.240]   And that to me really speaks to this.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.680]   So, yeah, I don't hold it against.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.300]   But it is true, like scientists are,
[02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:07.720]   when they're described, again,
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.240]   they're often said to be like children, right?
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.120]   You've heard this description.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:12.360]   They're inquisitive, they're curious, they're passionate.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.340]   They love, and I'm like, yeah,
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:14.360]   and they don't play well with others.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.640]   They're jealous, they're petty, they're selfish,
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:18.120]   they won't share their ball and they'll go home.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.820]   There's no such thing as a single-edged sword.
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.520]   I wish there were, you know,
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:23.140]   because we need some more of that,
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:24.640]   'cause you gotta dull it up.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.320]   But in this case, he, you know,
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.080]   I think when you have this kind of investment in science,
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.640]   it's gonna be natural.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.080]   But that doesn't mean we have to like,
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.680]   you know, feed the flames of competition.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.880]   You know, I'm like really,
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:40.880]   if you go to the homepage of the NSF,
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.260]   or the Department of Energy,
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:45.160]   or the recently released National Academy of Sciences
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:48.480]   Future of Science for the Astronomical Sciences,
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.920]   for the next 25 years or more,
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.360]   they talk about how many Nobel Prizes
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.080]   these different science things could win.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.000]   Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB,
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.480]   B-mode polarization, the nice, you know,
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.800]   that's figure two in this thing.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:03.640]   And I'm like, what message does that send to kids?
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:05.360]   Like, to young people?
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.640]   Like, that's what you should be doing
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.840]   so that you win this small, as you said,
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:10.040]   this prize given out by one hairless ape to another
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.880]   wearing a fancier costume eating reindeer?
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:12.960]   - Especially in the case of the Nobel Prize,
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:15.280]   it's only currently given to three people.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.440]   - At most, which was never one of his stipulate.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.800]   He actually said one, you can only give it to one person.
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.320]   So they change it, why did they change it?
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.720]   I talk about, I speculate in the book.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.680]   By the way, the book's only three chapters out of 11
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:27.400]   about the Nobel Prize and its effect.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.440]   But you know, one of the things that's been so interesting,
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.880]   like I'm speaking, actually this coming up in December,
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.000]   is that the Nobel Prize is given out
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.560]   on the day of Alfred Nobel's death.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.960]   There's a lot of, and they bring in flowers,
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:42.520]   not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.200]   which is in San Romino in Italy.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.960]   It's a lot of like death fascination.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.840]   You know, denial of death features heavily
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.640]   in the Nobel Prize, because it's like,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.120]   what outlives a person?
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.640]   Well, science can outlive a person.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.320]   My father has a theorem named after him.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.120]   It's still engraved in many places around the world.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.040]   You or I, we can go to different places around the world,
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.440]   people know who we are based on our publications.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.080]   We engrave things, we wanna store things,
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:08.360]   we wanna compress things.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.800]   And I think there's something beautiful about that,
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.520]   but there is a notion of denial of death.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:15.180]   Like there is a notion of what will outlast me,
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:17.120]   especially if you're among the many,
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.560]   90 something percent of members of National Academy
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.760]   don't believe in an active faith,
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.920]   you know, in a creator, in a God.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.020]   And science can substitute for that,
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:31.080]   but it's not ultimately as fulfilling.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:34.320]   I just, I don't believe it can fulfill a person the way,
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:37.400]   even practicing but not believing in a religion
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.280]   can fulfill a person.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.880]   - So, which is interesting,
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.520]   'cause you do bring up Ernest Becker
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:46.660]   and the denial of death in losing the Nobel Prize book.
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.320]   And there is a sense in which
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.200]   that's probably in part at the core of this,
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.200]   especially later dream of the Nobel Prize
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:57.120]   or a prize or recognition.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:00.840]   I've interacted with a few, you know,
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.500]   or a large number of scientists that are getting up in age.
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:09.200]   And there is the feeling of real pride of happiness
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:14.200]   in them from winning awards and getting certain recognitions.
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.520]   And I probably at the core of that is a kind of a mortality
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:23.520]   or a kind of desire for mortality.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.720]   And that was always off-putting to me as opposed to,
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.320]   I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it's off-putting,
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.320]   but it just, rather than celebrating the pure joy
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:43.440]   of solving the puzzles of the mysteries all around us,
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:50.600]   just the actual exploration of the mysterious.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.880]   - For its own sake. - For its own sake, yeah.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:56.880]   - Well, that's why I said, you know,
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.920]   it's like a scientist should, okay,
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.880]   you have to be careful and not have any, you know,
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.400]   physical, it has to be platonic,
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.880]   but you can think of scientists and mentor.
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.200]   I have a chart in the book and a plaque made
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.120]   by one of my graduate students, former graduate students,
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.400]   she's now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.520]   And she made this plaque and it has 17 generations.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.160]   So here I am, 17 levels down.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.240]   There's a guy, Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz,
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:24.080]   different Leibniz, 1596 he was born,
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:25.700]   and I'm in this chain.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:27.360]   And I don't know if you know this,
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:28.600]   but in the Russian language,
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:31.520]   the word scientist means someone who was taught.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:33.880]   I'll say it very simply, one who was taught, right?
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.280]   - Uchani. - Uchani.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.080]   So it probably means a guy who was taught, right?
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.760]   - No. - Okay, it'd just be a person.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.680]   - No, no, no, it's literally someone who was taught.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:43.880]   - Someone who was taught, right.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:44.720]   So what does that mean?
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:47.520]   To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.720]   One is that you have to be a good student to be a scientist,
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:52.600]   'cause you have to learn from somebody else.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.160]   Two, you have to be a teacher, you have to pay it forward.
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:58.560]   If you don't, I claim you're really not a scientist
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.160]   in the truest sense.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:02.180]   And I feel like with the work that I do in outreach
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.280]   and stuff like that, I'm doing it at scale,
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:07.100]   I'm influencing more than the 24 kids I might have
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.320]   in my graduate class or undergraduate class,
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.600]   and potentially could reach thousands of people
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.920]   around the world, and make them into scientists themselves,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.980]   because that's the flywheel that is only beneficial.
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:21.440]   There is no competition, there is no zero-sum,
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:24.880]   fixed mindset versus growth mindset,
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.400]   because it is an infinite game.
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.200]   Imagine a culture that had none of the trappings
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:30.920]   of the negativity of the Soviet Union,
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:35.560]   or pre-World War I Germany, or Imperial Japan,
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:38.880]   science celebrated, and we're just making
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.320]   a nation of scientists.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.840]   And we're not doing it to become multi-billionaires,
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:47.000]   or necessarily for any military purpose whatsoever.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.440]   But if we had that, sometimes I'm flying home at night,
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.040]   when you fly into LA, you literally, it's very rare,
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.080]   you can see the number 10 million.
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.160]   It's very hard to visualize things.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:58.800]   You see a brick wall, you ask how many bricks are there,
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.560]   it might be a thousand, two thousand.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:03.280]   10 million lights, there's 10 million souls.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.880]   And you can see, and they're discreet,
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:06.960]   they're not like the Milky Way all blending together.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:10.240]   - Each lost in their own busy lives,
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:13.120]   excited, fall in love, afraid of losing their job,
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:14.760]   all that, by the way, people should know
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:17.640]   that you're a pilot, so you literally mean fly.
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.120]   - Yeah, sometimes I get to do it.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.880]   - You get to look at the eye of God perspective
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:26.240]   on these 10 million, on these millions of helpless apes.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.160]   - And I don't think they're like constellations,
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:29.840]   but upside down, like the city.
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.440]   This is like a, hopefully I'll stay,
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.520]   keep the plane the right way up.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.040]   But when you think about that,
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.200]   imagine they're all working together.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.300]   And imagine, you always talk about love,
[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:42.240]   but you don't know that they're not worthy of love,
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:43.440]   so you're looking down on them.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.240]   And it's just amazing, 'cause you think,
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.360]   what an amazing creation is man and humans,
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.520]   and what can we do?
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.080]   It's phenomenal, it's so exciting.
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.280]   And then I get to do it, it's a job I say,
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.760]   don't tell Gavin Newsom, but I do it for free.
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:57.840]   I love what I do.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:01.160]   But to think about, oh, if my student succeeds,
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.160]   and I'm not, no.
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:05.560]   It is unfortunate that you have experienced it.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.800]   I've certainly experienced it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.960]   And I think there are ways around it.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.160]   I think it is a vexing problem,
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:14.380]   because people want to, it's very tempting
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.960]   to keep your own garden fertilized.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:20.000]   You know, one thing that's interesting is,
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.480]   people are like, why are you doing this thing?
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:23.520]   And a podcast, and you're supposed to be
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.380]   serious scientists leading this huge project,
[02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:28.880]   and collaborators, and I'm like, well,
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.880]   most of what I do, as I said before,
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:33.200]   for you it's Velcro, for me it's like,
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.220]   what is the deal with the safety standards
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.480]   on the truck that we're driving up
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:39.640]   to deliver the diesel fuel that will power the generator
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:40.960]   that will allow the concrete truck to,
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:42.800]   it has nothing to do with the Big Bang,
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:45.160]   inflation, the multiverse, God's existence,
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.000]   it has nothing to do with that, right?
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.560]   So those are people I say I have to talk to.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.800]   The people that come on the show,
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.440]   those are people I want to talk to.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.560]   And that's super fun, I mean,
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.360]   it's a real honor that I get to do it.
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.560]   I'm using, I have some unfair advantages, right?
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:59.280]   I'm at a top university, we have people
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:01.800]   that's affiliated with the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation,
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.480]   you know, brilliant scientists coming through,
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.880]   but I felt like it would be kind of a shame
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:09.840]   if I didn't allow them to teach at scale,
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.840]   'cause they're better teachers than I am.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:16.600]   - Let me ask you a interesting, maybe difficult question.
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:21.320]   Have you ever considered talking on your podcast
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:24.440]   with the people who would get the Nobel Prize for Bicep 2
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.200]   if it turned out to be detecting what it is?
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.280]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm still friends with them,
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:32.040]   and they have still gone on to,
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.600]   so we should say like why we didn't win the Nobel Prize,
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.800]   and then what happened with the group
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.360]   that is now leading it, that I'm completely divorced from,
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.560]   in a secular sense.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.720]   We're friends, you know, we see each other,
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.240]   you know, we send each other emails and stuff like that.
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.880]   - I would love to get their sense of like
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:54.280]   what the natural heartbreak built into the whole process
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.120]   of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is.
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:58.840]   I would love to hear an honest, real conversation.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:01.800]   I understand you're friends, but there's some hard truth
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.640]   that even friends will talk about it till you put a mic.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:04.160]   - No, they weren't happy I wrote the book.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:06.240]   I mean, I remember one of them, you know, was like,
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.840]   well, what's this I hear about a book?
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.160]   And I mean, a lot of people told me not to write the book.
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.840]   They said it's gonna give, you know,
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:13.360]   too much attention to the Nobel Prize,
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:15.120]   gonna look like sour grapes.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.720]   Again, I say, you can prove I have sour grapes or not,
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.920]   just give me the next prize.
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:19.760]   No, if I--
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:21.840]   - So you would, if you get a Nobel Prize for literature,
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.000]   you would turn it down?
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.160]   - I don't know.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.320]   It's funny, 'cause Sabina Hasenfelder,
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.960]   who is a fellow kind of YouTube sensation and--
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.280]   - And a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.320]   - You're right, she's so gracious and so good.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:40.320]   She has that German, you know, just gentleness.
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:43.200]   - She's a little too nice for my taste, I would say.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:44.600]   - I wish she could really say what she thinks.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.440]   And be snarky on occasion.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.680]   So she wrote a review of my book when it came out,
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:49.920]   three or four years ago.
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.040]   And she said, well, you know, Brian Keating,
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.640]   like she said, well, it's good, it's interesting.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.040]   He talks a lot about cosmology.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.040]   But, you know, they can do whatever the hell they want.
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:02.800]   And he, you know, presumably has problems with it,
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.240]   but it's none of his business, basically.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.640]   It's a private, and at the end she said,
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.440]   but, you know, if you want one good thing,
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.520]   he's a really good writer, and who knows,
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.000]   he could win the Nobel Prize in literature someday.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.160]   And then she allowed me to publish a rebuttal on her blog,
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:16.000]   which was kind of funny.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.640]   But anyway, no, so getting back to the guys
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.320]   that we were, you know, kind of collaboratemies,
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:24.480]   or frenemies, and we're still, look, you know,
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.380]   we don't wish each other active, ill, I've visited them,
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:29.960]   they're welcome to visit me, they have visited me.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:32.080]   The thing I have to say is that I just wonder
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.560]   about introspection.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:38.480]   Like, for me, literally, I don't care about the Nobel Prize,
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.040]   other than what it can do to, you know, benefit science.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.760]   But I no longer, I did, but by the way,
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.480]   I did seriously care about how it would benefit
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:47.440]   Brian Keating early on in my career.
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.480]   I'm just totally honest.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.440]   I'm not proud of it, it's kind of embarrassing.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.400]   But now I would hope that people would say,
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.480]   like, okay, the guy is like, you know,
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:56.840]   it's not, he's obsessed with it,
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:58.440]   my next book is not about this.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.160]   You know, it's about something completely different.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.160]   And, you know, I do feel like people lack introspection,
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:06.320]   a lot of times, in science.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.760]   Like, we don't think about why we're doing what we're doing.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:11.720]   And I think it comes down to curiosity.
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:13.640]   One thing about Joe, and again,
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.280]   I've only listened to like, I have to confess,
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.440]   you know, you're like my father,
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.480]   now I'm confessing my sins to you, father Lex,
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.640]   father Friedman. - Go on.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.360]   - I haven't listened to like that many of your episodes,
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.560]   start to finish, okay?
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.080]   With our friend, mutual friend, Eric,
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.800]   I've listened to a bunch of recent ones,
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:33.000]   a bunch of, Einstein, Weinstein,
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.440]   oh, Weinstein, Weinstein, that's what it is.
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.160]   - I get them confused with the brother.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.200]   - The brothers, the brothers,
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.040]   and a few others.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.960]   I haven't ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode,
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.800]   but from what I've seen with him,
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.360]   he has a preternatural curiosity.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.320]   He doesn't have passion.
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:50.720]   There are a lot of podcasts that have passion,
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.200]   like I've been on there, show you.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:53.440]   He has curiosity, like,
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.280]   he's not gonna stop talking about something
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.280]   until he hops it, until he understands it,
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.240]   until he gets it viscerally.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.320]   And I respect that,
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.880]   because as I say in this more recent book,
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:05.400]   passion's like, kind of like the dopamine hit
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.640]   that gets you started, like, oh, I'm gonna be great,
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:08.600]   maybe I can win a Nobel Prize.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.720]   Like, that's not gonna sustain you.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.200]   The sustenance comes from the passion
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.160]   converting to curiosity.
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:18.200]   And what I wanna do is convert as many things as possible
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.080]   to things that I can then,
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.960]   because actually I've had on people that discuss addiction.
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.920]   And there is an addictive quality to doing podcasts
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.120]   or whatever, but there's an addictive quality
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.320]   being a scientist.
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.320]   And you get to do things that are very specialized
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:36.120]   in specialized locations with special people,
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:38.560]   paid for by other people who have no fricking idea
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.400]   what you do.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.760]   So imagine you worked in some job,
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.760]   and Feynman said, he said all these contradictory things.
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.200]   Like, when he was, he was once said,
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.360]   he said, "If you can't explain it to your grandmother,
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.000]   "you don't understand it yourself."
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.200]   Then the day he won the Nobel Prize,
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.480]   a reporter asked him, "What'd you win it for?"
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.220]   He said, "If I could explain it to you, bud,
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.520]   "it wouldn't be worth a Nobel Prize."
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.960]   So let's leave aside his inherent contradictions.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:02.640]   But in reality, there is a kind of like dopamine rush
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.680]   that you get from it.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.640]   But what is ultimately gonna be the sustenance of it?
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:11.280]   So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.480]   to nucleate that.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:14.840]   I don't know, actually, I don't know if it's like,
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.800]   can you turn someone into a,
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.240]   I used to ask this question all the time.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:21.360]   Like, can you make someone creative?
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.000]   Like, can you teach someone to be creative?
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:23.880]   I don't know.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.400]   Can you teach someone to be curious?
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:27.220]   I don't know.
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:29.360]   I do know that kids are naturally curious.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:31.440]   As they get older, they get less curious.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.340]   Just like I heard from the other forward authors,
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:37.080]   James Altucher, he said, once he did,
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.480]   they did a study, kids smile 300 times a day,
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.600]   or smile or laugh, adults five or six.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:43.440]   Five or six.
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:44.520]   No, I'm just trying to get you to laugh,
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.600]   but you're not gonna laugh.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.440]   But anyway, no, it's true.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.960]   So somewhere you lose 30 to 50%.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.800]   - I'm not entertained.
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.120]   But that's 'cause I'm an adult.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.960]   No, and then I do remember there's some distribution
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   in those studies with the happier adults
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.720]   smile a little more, but still the kids
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:13:59.560]   blow 'em out of the water.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:00.380]   - Just crush it.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:02.480]   So can you, is it, or should, in other words,
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:05.280]   should we invest our energy in getting
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.160]   the half-life decay constant stretched out more
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.600]   for curiosity for kids?
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:12.280]   Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit,
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:13.440]   and then, I don't know.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.280]   It's an open question.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.320]   - Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace,
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:19.240]   the key to life is to be unboreable.
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.640]   I think you could train this kind of thing,
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:25.320]   which is in every single situation,
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.760]   so like, which I think is at the core,
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.800]   at least this correlated with curiosity,
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.800]   is in every situation, try to find
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:37.680]   the exciting, the fascinating.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.040]   Like in every situation, you sitting at the,
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:42.800]   I don't know, waiting for something at a DMV
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:43.920]   or something like that.
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.840]   Find something that excites you,
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:48.400]   like a thought, like watch people
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.400]   or start to think about, well, I wonder how many people
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.680]   have to go to the DMV every day.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.320]   And then try to go into the pothead mode
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.880]   of thinking like, wow, isn't this weird
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:03.160]   that there's a bunch of people that are having
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:06.440]   to get a stamp of approval from the government
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.520]   to drive their cars, and then there's millions
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:09.360]   of cars driving every day.
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:10.480]   - Or like, how can I do this better?
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.760]   Maybe there's some blockchain,
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.200]   and they could like, VIN transfer.
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.200]   Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.680]   No, that is a good, that is a good move.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.120]   - And then, every situation, I think if you rigorously
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.480]   like just practice that at a young age,
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.000]   I think you can learn to do that,
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.240]   because like, sometimes people like ask me for advice,
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:29.760]   and like, to do this thing or that thing is,
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:33.840]   I think you at the core really have to have this muscle
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:36.720]   of finding the awesomeness in everything,
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.600]   because if you're able to find the awesomeness
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:40.960]   in everything, like whatever journey you take,
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.800]   whatever weird--
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:45.760]   - Meant for Japan, I think that's what you meant.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:48.240]   - That you take through life is going to be productive,
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.680]   is gonna end up in a great place.
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.280]   So like, that muscle is at the core of it.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.040]   I guess curiosity is central to that.
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:02.200]   But you didn't win the Nobel Prize,
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.640]   the team of Bicep that led the Bicep 2
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.280]   didn't win the Nobel Prize, because of some space dust.
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:12.520]   - That's right, it's mixed schmutz.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.040]   - Which one is the moon, which one is--
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.880]   - That one's the dust, the space dust, yeah.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:21.640]   - What are we looking at?
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:25.880]   So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:27.840]   - Well, it's funny, I wrote these books,
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.680]   and I don't know about you, but when you get all these books,
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:31.520]   I'm sure you get books, people send you books,
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.400]   they always come in these dust jackets, right?
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.400]   I was always like, what the hell is a dust jacket?
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.160]   How much dust is raining down at any moment?
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:41.480]   I mean, this is immaculate, this room is Russian tidiness,
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:44.160]   but in a normal household, how much dust is raining down?
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.280]   It's not really pretty, until I wrote a book,
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:49.520]   and I realized, I'm writing a story
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:51.480]   about the origin of the universe,
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:54.240]   and the prologue to the cosmos,
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.440]   and dust is going to cover this story.
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:00.400]   It's actually more a story about
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.280]   astrophysics and cosmology than dust,
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.400]   and this is the link between the cosmological
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.120]   and the astrophysical, so what does that mean?
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.040]   So astrophysics is, broadly speaking,
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.040]   the study of physical phenomena manifest in the heavens,
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.800]   astronomical phenomena.
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.160]   Cosmology is concerned with the origin, evolution,
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.760]   composition of the universe as a whole,
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:20.360]   but it's not really concerned with stars,
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:22.400]   galaxies, and planets, per se,
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.520]   other than how they might help us measure
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.760]   the Hubble constant, the density of the universe,
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:29.280]   the neutrino content, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:31.920]   So we have a tendency to kind of look a little bit,
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.160]   they're like, not all astronomers
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:35.400]   and astrophysicists are equal.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.360]   They're all equal, but some are more equal than others.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.000]   So we have kind of a prejudice, a little swagger, right?
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.360]   And cosmologists are studying, we're using Einstein,
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.400]   we're not using Boltzmann,
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:46.840]   we're thinking of the biggest possible pictures.
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:49.880]   In so doing, you can actually become blinded
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:52.840]   to otherwise obvious effects
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:55.920]   that people would have not overlooked.
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:58.600]   In our case, when we sought out the signal,
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:01.120]   we were using the photons that make up
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.680]   this primordial heat bath that surrounds the universe,
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:06.320]   luckily only at three degrees Kelvin approximately.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.200]   We're using those as a type of film
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.160]   onto which gravitational waves will reverberate it,
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.040]   make them oscillate preferentially in a polarized way,
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:16.120]   and then we can use our polarized sunglasses,
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.120]   but in a microwave format,
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:20.920]   to detect the characteristic twofold symmetry pattern
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.440]   of under rotation.
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:24.200]   That's the technical way that we undergo it.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.160]   I mean, there's a lot more to it.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.880]   But there are more than one thing
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.560]   that can mimic exactly that signal.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.760]   First of all, when you look at the signal,
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.240]   the signal, if inflation took place, big if,
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.880]   but if it took place,
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.880]   the signal would be about one or two parts per billion
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.000]   of the CMB temperature itself.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.960]   So a few nano Kelvin, the CMB is a few Kelvin,
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:50.480]   the signal from these B-modes would be a few nano Kelvin.
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:52.200]   It's astonishing to think,
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:54.360]   Penzias and Wilson, 1965,
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:57.960]   measured something that's a billion times brighter,
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:18:59.880]   and that was what, 60 years ago,
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:02.480]   let's call it 60 years ago since they discovered it.
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:04.400]   Moore's law, you're more expert,
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:05.920]   let's call it every two years.
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.480]   So you're talking about like two to the 30th power
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:10.640]   doubling or something like that, at that.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.600]   So let's call it two to the 20th, something like that.
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:17.120]   So that's like only two to the 10th is a thousand,
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:18.320]   correct my math, I'm wrong.
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.400]   Two to the 20th is a million,
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:22.000]   two to the 30th is a billion.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.440]   So we're outpacing Moore's law
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:27.520]   in terms of the sensitivity of our instruments
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.360]   to detect these feeble signals from the cosmos.
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:31.920]   And they don't have to deal with,
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:35.240]   in the semiconductor factory in Santa Clara, California,
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.920]   they don't have to deal with meteorites and astronauts
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:39.760]   and things like coming into the laboratory.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:41.160]   It's a clean room, it's pristine,
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.760]   they can control everything about it, right?
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:44.680]   We can't control the cosmos.
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.440]   And the cosmos is literally littered
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.920]   with particles of schmutz, of failed planets,
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:52.480]   asteroids, meteoroids, things that didn't coalesce
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:55.640]   to make either the earth, the moon,
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:57.480]   the planet Jupiter or its moons,
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:59.800]   or get sucked into them and make craters on them,
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:00.940]   et cetera, et cetera.
[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:04.240]   The rest of it is falling and it comes in a power spectrum.
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:05.560]   There's very few, thank God,
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:09.320]   Chicxulub sized impact or progenitors
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:11.840]   that will take out all life on earth.
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:15.000]   But there's extremely large number of tiny dust particles
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.400]   and microscopic grains.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:17.540]   And then there's a fair number
[02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.680]   of intermediate sized particles.
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:21.640]   It turns out this little guy here
[02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:26.720]   is the end product of a collapsing star
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.480]   that explodes in what's called a supernova,
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:30.080]   type two supernova.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:31.800]   So stars spend most of their life
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:36.800]   fusing helium nuclei protons and neutrons
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:38.880]   into helium nuclei.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.720]   And then from there it can make other things
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:43.280]   like beryllium and briefly make beryllium
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.160]   and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:48.680]   all the way up until it tries to make iron and nickel.
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:50.640]   And iron and nickel are endothermic.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.760]   It takes more energy than gets liberated
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:55.880]   to make an atom of iron.
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.080]   When that happens, there's no longer enough heat
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:01.400]   supplying pressure to resist the gravitational collapse
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.920]   of the material that was produced earlier.
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:04.920]   So the star forms, you know, goes inside out.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.440]   That's how scientists discovered helium
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:08.560]   was discovered on the sun.
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.400]   I don't know, did you know?
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:10.560]   That's why it's called helium.
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:11.960]   Yeah, they went there at night.
[02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:14.000]   And-- - Oh, well done.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:14.840]   - They went there at night.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.720]   Now, helium means Helios is the god of the sun.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:18.400]   It was discovered in its spectrum
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:20.920]   from observations of the telescope like 150 years ago.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:23.080]   It wasn't discovered like when oxygen
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:25.520]   and you know, iron was discovered.
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:28.400]   So it's only a relatively recent comer to the periodic table.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.160]   - So helium came after oxygen.
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.720]   - Oh no, first hydrogen forms into helium.
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:34.880]   So that's the first thing that formed.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.280]   - No, in terms of discoveries.
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:37.360]   - Oh yeah, after oxygen.
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:40.280]   Yeah, I think Priestley and yeah, and others,
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:42.840]   the Dalton discovered it in the 1700s.
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:45.040]   No, helium was really only discovered from the spectrum
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.560]   of looking at the sun and seeing the weird atomic absorption
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:51.360]   and called Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.860]   So, but when it tries to make iron,
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:55.600]   there's no longer any leftover heat.
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:57.800]   In other words, there's heat left over from fusing,
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:59.680]   as you know, the sun of a plasma physicist,
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:02.300]   he fused to a hydrogen nuclei,
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.400]   you get excess energy plus you get helium.
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:05.880]   So that's why fusion energy could be
[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:08.440]   the energy source of the future and always will be.
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:11.360]   No, no, hopefully it'll come much sooner than that.
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.920]   And so doing, trying to make iron, it takes more energy,
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.600]   doesn't give off enough energy, star collapses, explodes.
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:18.680]   And what does it spray out into the, you know,
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:20.280]   cosmic interstellar medium?
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:22.760]   It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:25.160]   Luckily for us, because some of that coalesced
[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.800]   and made the core of the earth,
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:29.400]   onto which the lighter like silica and carbon
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.520]   and the dirt and the crust of the earth were formed.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.640]   And some of that made its way to the crust.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:35.400]   The iron made its way to the crust.
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:36.960]   Some of that your mother ate
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:39.480]   and synthesized hemoglobin molecules.
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.400]   And hemoglobin has iron particles in it.
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:43.120]   It's a quite amazing substance.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:44.800]   Without it, you know, we wouldn't have our red blood,
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:47.360]   we wouldn't exist as we are.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.840]   - Is this a very long, complicated mom joke?
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:51.160]   (laughing)
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:53.760]   - I've done enough dad jokes, my quote is up.
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:57.100]   So I'm taking this object, you know, seriously.
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:59.240]   There's not, all of it gets bound up in a planet.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:01.600]   In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.640]   And so there's a lot of schmutz left over,
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:06.580]   some of which gets in the way of our telescopes,
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:08.600]   looking back to the beginning of time.
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:10.400]   And some of those molecules, like iron,
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:12.100]   is used in compass needles, right?
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:13.320]   They're magnetized.
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:16.320]   And magnetic fields in our galaxy can align them
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:18.140]   and make the exact polarization pattern
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:19.580]   that we're looking for.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:21.760]   As if the compass needles get all aligned,
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:24.160]   that's like the polarization of the dust grain.
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.240]   It's like that polarizing filter.
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:29.040]   That means light polarized like this will get absorbed,
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.860]   and light polarized like this will go through.
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:33.360]   So it's absorbing, it's making 100% polarized light
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.800]   out of an initially unpolarized light source.
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:36.840]   And that's what happened.
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.840]   And what we ended up claiming on March 17th,
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:45.360]   and I'm sure if you were there, you might remember this,
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.440]   at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:48.280]   there was an announcement.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:49.920]   There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:50.960]   in the audience.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:53.640]   And the BICEP2 team, which I was no longer leading,
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:55.360]   I was still a member of it.
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:56.240]   In fact, in the announcement,
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:58.960]   the first person they mentioned besides, you know,
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.920]   thank you all for being here is me
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:02.440]   and my team at UC San Diego.
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:05.240]   Although I wasn't invited to go to the press conference
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:06.960]   because that-- - Harvard.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.360]   - Complicated, yes, exactly.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.960]   It's a little school up there in the Cambridge area.
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:15.560]   And so they ended up making this announcement
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:18.180]   that we had discovered the aftershocks of inflation.
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:21.880]   We detected the gravitational waves shaking up the CMB.
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:24.600]   And on that day, past Lex Friedman podcast,
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:26.600]   back when it was called Artificial Intelligence,
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.200]   Max Tegmark said, "Goodbye universe, hello multiverse,
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.160]   "and hello Nobel Prize."
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:35.200]   See, he saw that as confirmatory evidence,
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.680]   not only of inflation, not only of gravitational waves,
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:39.160]   but of the multiverse.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.800]   Goodbye universe, hello multiverse.
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:44.480]   - Multiverse is a natural consequence.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:46.200]   - Consequence of inflation, yes.
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:49.600]   According to its prominent supporters, yeah.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:51.880]   - Yeah, and of course, leave the poetry to Max,
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:54.120]   which he does masterfully.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.280]   Okay, so that, the excitement was there.
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.760]   I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.600]   is there too.
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:04.920]   That's some of the darker moments you're going through.
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:07.800]   But broadly for the space of science,
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:09.040]   there's excitement there.
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:09.880]   - Huge excitement.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:12.680]   And I often note that this is a problem
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.060]   in what I call the science media complex.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:17.000]   Because oftentimes you'll see things
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.400]   like past guest Sarah Seger, Venus Life exists.
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:23.760]   And that will be really, I mean, it's fascinating, right?
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:24.800]   And with the work that she's doing
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:26.560]   or her colleagues are doing.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.200]   Clara, who's on your show as well.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:31.320]   And that will be on front page, New York Times,
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:34.200]   Boston Globe, San Diego Union Tribune.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.080]   It'll be above the fold, make headlines around the world.
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.160]   And then six months, 12 months later,
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:41.200]   as is the case for us, Retraction.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.960]   Page C17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads,
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:47.240]   you know, and underneath the personal.
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:48.800]   So we have a problem in science.
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.720]   That the, you know, if it explodes, it leads, you know,
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.600]   and we get this huge fanfare.
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:56.900]   And this is not unique to my experiment.
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:58.600]   This happened with the earlier discovery
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.080]   of so-called Martian life discovered in Antarctica,
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.200]   which was announced after peer review.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:07.620]   We weren't peer reviewed at the point
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:08.460]   when we made the announcement.
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:10.740]   We had a press conference and there are other reasons
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:13.000]   that the team leaders felt it was important to do that
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.840]   so that we don't get scooped by a referee who's unethical.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:17.160]   We thought we had done everything right,
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:18.280]   but that's confirmation bias.
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:19.960]   - There's like levels to this.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.800]   - Yeah, there were many levels.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:23.800]   And there were people, you know, me warning
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.200]   about how it would be interpreted
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.260]   and wanting to also make sure that we put all the data out,
[02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:30.360]   including the maps, which we still haven't released.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.080]   And so there were a lot of reasons to be skeptical,
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.840]   but the public never knows this.
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:38.440]   I think it's, so I've made a rule
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.480]   that if I am ever in charge of, you know,
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:42.980]   doling out large amounts of science funding,
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:45.520]   that when you, you should keep kind of an option.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:47.880]   In other words, you should have money for publicity.
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:48.720]   It's fine.
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:50.220]   Have money for your press conference.
[02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:54.180]   But hold in reserve in a bond to be used, hopefully never,
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:58.360]   but if it's to be used, an equal fund for the retraction,
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:26:59.860]   if it should occur.
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:01.720]   - So you would like to see,
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:04.680]   'cause that's a big part of transparency is the,
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.600]   to me in the space of science, at least,
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:13.080]   that's as beautiful because it reveals the,
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:15.200]   it's like, it tells a great story.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:18.320]   There's an excitement, there's a--
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.160]   - Humanity.
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:21.640]   - So there's a climax to the triumph,
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.400]   but there's also a climax to the disappointment at the end.
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.560]   Because that also eventually leads to triumph again.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:32.520]   That sets up, that's the drama that sets up the triumph.
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:36.920]   Like with Andrew Wiles, Fermat's theorem,
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:39.020]   I guess it's not the last thing, whatever,
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:43.600]   is like the ups and downs of that, the rollercoaster,
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:44.440]   the whole thing should be documented.
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:46.200]   - That is science, that is science.
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:49.040]   And when we don't do that, then we cultivate this aura
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.080]   that excludes other scientists.
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:53.120]   Often from minorities or women,
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:55.840]   that you have to be, like Einstein came out of the womb
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.560]   and he was just like this guy with curly, no, he wasn't.
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:01.720]   He wasn't bad at math, that's all nonsense.
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:03.600]   But he said that he, you know what he said
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:05.200]   he attributed his success to, Lex?
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.560]   He said, "I never asked my dad what happened
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.360]   "when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid.
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.280]   "And thank God I didn't, because had I,
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.640]   "he would have told me the best answer of the day."
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.920]   Which, by the way, he would create 20 years later
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:21.560]   as a 26 year old in the patent office,
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:22.800]   obviously in Switzerland.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:26.180]   And in so doing, by delaying when he asked these questions,
[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:28.680]   he said, "I approached it with the intellect
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:31.600]   "of a mature scientist, not a little kid.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.160]   "And I wouldn't have accepted the same explanation."
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:37.400]   So sometimes assuming that scientists are infallible,
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:40.280]   ineffable, omniscient, you know, being,
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.720]   I think that really does a disservice.
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:42.860]   And Jim Gates said, you know, he's like,
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:45.120]   "Einstein wasn't always Einstein."
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:48.040]   And we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril,
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:51.760]   because we're humans, until we have artificial Einstein,
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:54.160]   which I don't think will ever exist.
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:58.000]   - You've launched the Assayer Project,
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.620]   where you hope to assess theories
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:01.840]   of everything with experiments.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:03.860]   You have a YouTube video where you're announcing that.
[02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:05.480]   That looks super cool.
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:07.840]   Can you describe this project?
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.040]   And you also mentioned, kind of,
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.920]   you give a shout out to a little known fellow
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.280]   by the name of Galileo Galilei,
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.200]   as an inspiration to this project.
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:21.040]   - Yeah, so Galileo is kind of my avatar, my hero,
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:23.560]   the kind of all-around scientist that I would love
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:27.640]   to approach the logarithm of Galileo.
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:31.020]   He was not only a phenomenal scientist,
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:36.020]   he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet, a philosopher.
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:38.280]   And back then, they didn't have distinctions
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:39.840]   between, you know, scientist and, you know,
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:42.080]   it was like a physician was like a physicist.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:44.920]   And he would indulge, you know,
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:48.200]   kind of these really intellectual flights of fancy,
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:52.520]   thinking about phenomena such as the Earth's tides
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:55.360]   or the, you know, the composition of the Milky Way.
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:57.120]   And what's interesting about Galileo
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:00.880]   is that he was almost as wrong often as he was right.
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:03.520]   And Galileo was not alone like this.
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:06.740]   I always say, like, Einstein had at least seven
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:08.440]   Nobel Prizes that he could have won
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:10.640]   for discoveries that later became true.
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:13.840]   But he also had seven, you know, huge, you know,
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:16.960]   impossible to believe blunders in some sense.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:18.560]   That's too bad 'cause he could have had a good career,
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:19.480]   as I would say.
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:21.280]   And Galileo was like that too.
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:24.640]   In other words, he would fall victim to, I think,
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:27.160]   this confirmation bias that all scientists
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:29.760]   have to guard their lives against, their careers,
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:32.040]   their brands, their reputations against,
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:34.960]   which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn't conform
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:38.400]   to what you're trying to prove for one reason or another,
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:42.080]   or the radical acceptance of things that do comport with it
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:43.880]   in order to bolster your confidence in it.
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:45.680]   And both are equally intoxicating.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:49.360]   It's, you know, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.120]   because it really, you know, reinforces this notion,
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:54.600]   which is partially sunk cost.
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:57.540]   You put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.
[02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:59.640]   You don't wanna be wrong and go back on it.
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:04.640]   And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive
[02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:08.640]   about things such as, you know, the Earth being
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:11.140]   not located at the center of the solar system
[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:12.240]   and the sun being the center,
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:14.220]   so-called Copernican hypothesis.
[02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:19.200]   And he would use as evidence very, very interesting ideas
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.980]   that all of which were wrong, basically.
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:22.920]   And in fact, we weren't able to prove
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:25.120]   that the Earth orbited around the sun.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:28.440]   And I ask you, like, can you prove the Earth is not flat?
[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:30.080]   No, well, you're a flat earther anyway.
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.920]   But I ask my graduates.
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:34.840]   - Proud Flat Earth Society member,
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:36.840]   t-shirts coming out soon.
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.680]   Let's Screamer.com/merch.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:42.140]   - It's actually not trivial to do that,
[02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:43.620]   but most of my students, graduate students,
[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:45.220]   can prove that the Earth is rounder,
[02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:46.100]   explain how the Earth--
[02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:48.020]   - It is actually not trivial to do, though.
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:49.060]   - It's not. - Yeah.
[02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:50.180]   - And much harder is to prove
[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:51.660]   that the Earth goes around the sun.
[02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:53.220]   In fact, that's extremely hard to prove.
[02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:54.860]   And almost none of my students,
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:57.280]   even after they get their PhD and the final exam,
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:58.500]   I kinda like to just, you know,
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:31:59.700]   give them a little bit of humility.
[02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:01.380]   'Cause I think to be a good scientist,
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:03.620]   you need to be humble, you need to have a little humility,
[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:05.120]   and you need to have swagger.
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:07.380]   You need to feel like a little cocky, like, I can do this.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:09.460]   I can do this thing that Einstein, by definition,
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:10.300]   couldn't do.
[02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:11.340]   I'm gonna attempt it.
[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:13.620]   I'm gonna attempt to do what was impossible
[02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:15.220]   just a generation ago.
[02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:18.500]   - How do you prove that the Earth goes around the sun?
[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:22.180]   Do you have to, is it by the motion of other planets?
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:23.380]   - So, there are many ways to do it.
[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:24.800]   I mean, obviously, you could take a spaceship,
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:28.060]   park it at the north celestial pole of our solar system,
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:30.140]   and just watch what happens.
[02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:31.820]   But obviously, that wasn't how it was discovered
[02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:32.860]   in the late 1700s.
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:34.460]   So, it's called aberration.
[02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:36.660]   So, if you look at stars,
[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:39.620]   as the Earth orbits around the sun,
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:42.020]   the position of the stars will shift slightly
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:43.300]   because of the tilt of the Earth,
[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:46.700]   and because the Earth is in motion around the sun,
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:50.500]   and because the Earth has a non-trivial amount of velocity
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:53.720]   compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the sun,
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:55.900]   the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses,
[02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.520]   and those will correspond to the fact
[02:32:57.520 --> 02:32:59.020]   that we're moving around,
[02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:00.580]   if they're at infinite distance,
[02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:02.180]   which we assume that they are, they're not, really.
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:03.740]   But for all intents and purposes,
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:04.740]   in the scale of the solar system,
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.100]   they're infinitely far away.
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:08.140]   So, that's called stellar aberration.
[02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:10.580]   And that was the first way it was discovered.
[02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:11.820]   And actually, we still use that.
[02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.260]   We have to correct for that effect
[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:16.060]   when we measure the cosmic microwave background.
[02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:18.340]   Because imagine you're inside of an oven,
[02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:19.820]   it has some temperature, three Kelvin,
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:21.100]   a thousand Kelvin, whatever.
[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:22.720]   If I'm moving towards you,
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:24.500]   the photons that are coming to me in that direction
[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:26.180]   will be blue-shifted, hotter,
[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:27.980]   and the ones behind me will be red-shifted.
[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:30.860]   I'll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.620]   of matter or energy where you are,
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:34.780]   and it's an extension of the Doppler effect.
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:36.460]   So, we actually make use of that
[02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:39.540]   and construct what's called a local standard of rest.
[02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:41.100]   Anyway, so you can do it.
[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:42.300]   But Galileo said, "No, no, no,
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:43.820]   "I'm not gonna wait for that.
[02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:45.780]   "I have other proofs for it."
[02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:47.780]   One of which is that the Earth has tides.
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:50.100]   And the tides come in and out twice a day,
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:51.420]   high tide and low tide.
[02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:53.420]   And he made the analogy,
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:56.180]   because the Earth is moving around the sun,
[02:33:56.180 --> 02:33:57.580]   say this is the sun here,
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:58.860]   and it's moving around the sun,
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:00.460]   but it's also rotating on its axis.
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:02.380]   See how the water's sloshing up and down
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.740]   inside the vodka bottle?
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:05.580]   As that happens, he said,
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:06.860]   "That's what the tides are caused by."
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:07.700]   Totally wrong.
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:09.260]   - Most people listen to this podcast.
[02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:12.300]   Just so you know, if you're listening to this,
[02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:14.780]   he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.
[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:15.620]   - Half drunk.
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:20.620]   - And we're both drunk and whatever else is possible.
[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.940]   - So, as it sloshed around, he claimed that was what,
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:23.940]   no, it has nothing to do with that.
[02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:28.700]   The moon, over there, the moon pulls differentially
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.660]   on the Earth and the Earth's ocean.
[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:33.060]   That causes the oceans to bulge slightly
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:35.020]   towards and away from where the moon is.
[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:37.460]   And the moon is actually the source of the Earth's tides.
[02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:39.660]   It has nothing to do with Copernicus,
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:40.700]   the orbit of the sun.
[02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:42.460]   So he was totally wrong about that.
[02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:44.580]   He also thought that the Milky Way
[02:34:44.580 --> 02:34:46.220]   was comprised only of stars,
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:47.940]   when we know it's made of gas, dust,
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:49.780]   nebulae and things like that.
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:51.260]   So he had his fair share of blunders.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.660]   Now, one thing I always kind of make note of,
[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.460]   and I'm actually producing along with Jim Gates,
[02:34:57.460 --> 02:35:00.500]   Fabiola Gianatti, Frank Wilczek,
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:03.980]   and Carlo Rovelli and my friend, Lucio Piccirillo,
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:07.220]   the first ever audio book of one of Galileo's dialogue,
[02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:08.980]   the one where he claimed to find evidence
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:11.140]   for the orbit of the Earth around the sun.
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:12.580]   But it was an error.
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:14.740]   - So you're reading parts of this text.
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:16.500]   - Yeah, it's a brilliant book.
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:19.260]   So this book was written in 1632.
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:20.700]   It was written and it was the one
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:22.340]   that caused him to go into house arrest
[02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:24.500]   and almost threatened to be tortured.
[02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.500]   And that book laid out his arguments
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.460]   for what was called the Copernican
[02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:34.340]   or the non-peripatetic Aristotelian, et cetera,
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:37.140]   notion of the planetary dynamic.
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:39.780]   And eventually he was forced to recant
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:40.700]   that he believed in it.
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:43.740]   And allegedly he said he still believes the Earth moves.
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:44.940]   Anyway, so we're making that,
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:46.300]   it's written in the form of a trilogue.
[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:48.700]   It's actually called the dialogue with three people.
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:50.380]   There's one named Salviati,
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:53.140]   who is espousing Galileo's notions
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.900]   about how the heavens were orchestrated.
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:58.240]   And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:59.980]   Then there's a middleman, Segredo.
[02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:03.100]   So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:05.500]   I am playing Segredo,
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:07.700]   who's like an intelligent interlocutor.
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:09.460]   I'm a, you know, kind of just,
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:12.340]   I can appreciate Aristotle, I can appreciate Copernicus.
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:15.220]   Then there's this guy, Simplicio, the simpleton.
[02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:18.220]   And he espouses the words of the Pope.
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:19.540]   So you can imagine like, you know,
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:21.660]   you're working in Putin's government
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:23.540]   or you're working in whatever.
[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.980]   And all of a sudden you're kind of putting the words
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:29.760]   of like the fool, literally calling the fool,
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:32.760]   but you're using the words of the all supreme powerful being
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:35.280]   on earth at that time, it was the Vatican church,
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:37.260]   especially for an Italian like Galileo.
[02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:40.440]   So he wasn't as brilliant, you know, politically
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:44.160]   as he was astrophysically and otherwise.
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.520]   - Who's doing Simplicio?
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:48.200]   - Simplicio is a friend of mine
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:51.520]   in University of Manchester named Lucio Picciarello.
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:53.280]   He's a Irish guy, but he has an Italian,
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:55.400]   no, no, he's a full-blooded Italian.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:58.560]   They all speak English and Italian, I only speak.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:00.400]   And that four words are written by,
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.640]   so one forward and this place has three forwards,
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:04.940]   which is like a 12 word.
[02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:07.520]   Okay, the four words are written by--
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:09.000]   - Can you explain that joke for me?
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.240]   - Yeah, that was a good one.
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:12.540]   The four word, three forwards,
[02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:14.520]   one of them is written by Albert Einstein,
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:17.680]   in which he says Galileo was not only
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:19.180]   one of the greatest scientists in history,
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:21.680]   this is Einstein telling Galileo,
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.820]   but he was one of the greatest writers
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:26.380]   and minds of all of human history.
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:29.500]   That forward is read by Frank Wilczek, who you've had.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:31.680]   Jim Gates, who you've also had,
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:35.080]   he reads the translation, the translator,
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:38.840]   Stillman Drake is a renowned scientific translator.
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:40.800]   And then Fabiola Giannotti,
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.880]   she reads the introduction and dedication
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:46.760]   from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:49.320]   and some of the different introductions
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:50.600]   that Galileo himself had.
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.020]   It's such a thrill to be able to do it.
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:54.360]   I only randomly found out,
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.240]   'cause I wanted to study it and it's like 500 pages long.
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:37:59.440]   And I was like, let me get the audio book
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:01.320]   'cause I'm an audio medium kind of guy.
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:03.680]   Didn't exist, so I said, let's do it ourselves.
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.440]   And so we did it and hopefully it'll be out
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:09.440]   on Galileo's birthday, which is February 15th, 2022.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:11.560]   It'll be a ripe 457,
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:13.480]   but that's not the only one of his books.
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:14.760]   Galileo wrote many books,
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:18.000]   one of which is called The Military Compass.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.620]   And this is an interesting book
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:22.600]   for my blockchain and your blockchain aficionados.
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:24.960]   In this book, he talks about a compass,
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:26.440]   which is not a magnetic compass,
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:27.880]   but an actual slide rule.
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:29.440]   It's basically a slide rule.
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:31.440]   And it's a manual.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:34.000]   It's like, imagine if your phone came with a manual.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.040]   Nowadays they don't, right?
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.080]   But this was a manual for how to use this slide rule,
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:39.760]   which is enormously important.
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:41.840]   And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples.
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:43.080]   It's a brilliant book.
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.400]   One of the examples is how do you convert money?
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.520]   So he does a currency conversion
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:50.760]   between Ducati and Florentine Ducati
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:54.000]   and Scuti and whatever, you know, lira, whatever.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.920]   He does all these currency conversions.
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:58.920]   One copy of this book, or maybe two exist,
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.200]   first printings from 1600 still exist.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.080]   If Galileo had just kept those in his family,
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:08.680]   they're worth a hundred million dollars.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:10.120]   Nowadays you can't get a Scuti.
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:11.420]   A Scuti is worth nothing.
[02:39:11.420 --> 02:39:13.040]   Like a Ducati is worth nothing.
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.320]   I mean, maybe some collector wants a piece of paper, right?
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.160]   So it's a lesson.
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.760]   Like there are value in physical, you know,
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:21.560]   non-fungible tokens, this original non-fungible token.
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:24.480]   But then a third book is called the Assayer.
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:26.400]   So what is an Assayer?
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:28.800]   So Assayers were kind of like these alchemists,
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:29.880]   you know, physicists, chemists
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.960]   that would be around a court.
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:35.280]   And every so often for the treasurer,
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:37.880]   they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.760]   and convert that to script or, you know, paper money.
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.400]   And to do that, they needed someone to verify
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:46.080]   with a standard of gold that they knew to be gold
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:49.680]   and do some kind of semi non-destructive evaluation
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.760]   of the purported object, the metal,
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:53.160]   that was supposed to be gold.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:55.440]   So they would take these pieces of gold,
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:56.360]   theoretically gold,
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.120]   and they would rub it on something called a touchstone.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.720]   Touchstone was a special piece of rock, granite, whatever.
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.840]   It has no intrinsic value.
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.080]   It's just a piece of rock.
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:07.640]   But with that rock, you could assay
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:10.320]   and determine the content of this thing
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:11.360]   that could be worth, you know,
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.240]   millions of lira or whatever, right?
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:15.000]   So it was an incredibly important job.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.680]   And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:20.640]   and use it to do something valuable.
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:22.720]   What I want to do in the Assayer Project
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.840]   is take this plethora of physical theories of everything.
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:28.520]   I said recently, you know,
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:29.920]   we should give a Nobel Prize to someone
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:32.320]   who doesn't come up with a theory of everything.
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:34.800]   Because there's just, that's a good,
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.280]   there's just like, it's just rotten with them.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:39.000]   And I think it's great.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.920]   You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:44.680]   and I'm not denigrating software at all,
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.480]   but like, you can create a lot of software.
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.320]   You can make a quine and it'll make its own quine.
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:51.240]   And like, you can make infinite amounts of software.
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:52.080]   - Look it up, kids.
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:54.000]   - Yeah, and that's one of my favorite videos.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.840]   And you can see, you can replicate, you can't replicate,
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:57.640]   you can't make a telescope that makes a telescope
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:58.480]   that makes a telescope.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:40:59.840]   In other words, hardware's kind of like
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:02.000]   the non-fungible token that's the ultimate minted,
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.400]   you know, limited edition, the book,
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:05.320]   the compass book, like I talked.
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:07.360]   And so it's very expensive.
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:09.080]   That means you have to be very careful
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:12.800]   before you invest decades, billions, and humans
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:15.600]   into pursuing one of these theories of everything.
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:17.840]   You have to have good intuition for it.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:21.160]   And lately what I've seen is not predictions,
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:22.840]   but retrodictions.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:25.120]   So you see that the Large Hadron Collider
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.680]   will come out with a measurement.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:28.160]   And then so-and-so will say,
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:30.920]   oh, this is, you know, this is compatible
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.040]   with string theory.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:35.400]   Or G minus two of the muon, it has these bizarre properties,
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:37.660]   fifth force, string theory predicts this.
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:40.000]   String theory solves this.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:43.560]   Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos,
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:47.280]   Large Hadron Collider bottom or B experiment.
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:48.120]   Blah, blah, blah.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:50.040]   They'll say that it's compatible after the fact.
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:51.280]   And it's not so bad, right?
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:53.120]   'Cause look, what did Einstein do with GR,
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:54.920]   general relativity?
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:58.040]   The first thing he did was not predict something new.
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:01.320]   He looked at the anomalous behavior of the planet Mercury.
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:03.440]   And he saw it was behaving strangely.
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:05.080]   And people had said, oh, that's because
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.200]   there's another planet hiding behind the sun
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:09.120]   that we can't see that perturbs the orbit
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:09.960]   of the planet Mercury.
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:11.080]   It's called Vulcan.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:13.000]   That was one approach.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.760]   That's kind of like the dark matter approach
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.520]   where it's like there's a clump of matter
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:19.080]   that we can't see that's influencing the planet
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:20.160]   that we can't see.
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:23.080]   And we use that to divine and intuit the existence
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:23.920]   of the other planet.
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:25.480]   That's actually how Neptune was discovered.
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:27.560]   Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous behavior
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:29.160]   of the planet Uranus.
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:30.880]   So Neptune was dark, we couldn't see it.
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:33.040]   It was tugging on Uranus in a certain way.
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:36.080]   And that led to Le Verrier discovering the planet,
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:38.240]   predicting where this planet should be found.
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:39.840]   So it had a good heritage.
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:41.600]   And physics, right, to predict this planet
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:43.160]   that you couldn't see, that worked.
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:46.200]   But Einstein said, no, it's caused by the warping
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:49.680]   and bending of space time due to the presence of matter
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:51.600]   who would later become known as the Einstein equations.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:53.880]   So he explained why Mercury did that.
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.920]   He didn't, and it was known since the time of Newton
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:58.640]   that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:42:59.600]   So he didn't predict it.
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.600]   He retrodicted it.
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:01.480]   That's fine.
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:04.000]   But at some point, you should come up with something new
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.280]   that's uniquely predictive of your theory, as I just said.
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:09.920]   The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:11.040]   is actually a valid theory.
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:14.560]   It just happens not to make sense in the context of Vulcan.
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:16.920]   And so if he had kept doing that,
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:20.320]   maybe perhaps he wouldn't have come up with
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:22.320]   these other predictions that he would later reject.
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:24.920]   Like he rejected the existence of gravitational waves.
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:26.600]   Ewan Barry talked about that.
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:27.440]   He didn't actually believe it.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:29.840]   It was the one peer-reviewed paper that he had.
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:31.320]   He used to send back in those days,
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:33.560]   he'd send a letter to Nature, physical review,
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:36.680]   publish this, let them know how much it costs.
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:38.280]   And they got it rejected 'cause he said
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:40.200]   you can't detect gravitational waves.
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:41.840]   And actually, or they're not real.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:42.960]   And the guy showed that they're real
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:44.960]   'cause he corrected a math error
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:47.160]   in Einstein and Rosen's paper.
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:48.000]   So it's fascinating.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.880]   What should the assayer do?
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:52.400]   He or she should look at these theories,
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:54.600]   look what things they explain that already exist,
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:58.840]   and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:01.880]   if we can build experiments to test them.
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:03.120]   - So you have to kind of challenge yourself
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:06.080]   to think about what kind of predictions
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:09.440]   can they make such that we can construct experiments?
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:14.360]   So that's like ultimately back going to the signal,
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.680]   to the experimenter's theorist, essentially.
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:19.520]   - That's right.
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:24.080]   - So like very experiment-centric exploration
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:25.920]   of the fundamental theory of everything.
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:26.760]   - That's right.
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:29.000]   And the best scientists, the best physicists,
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.800]   were both experimentalists and theorists.
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:34.320]   Or at least that they, if they were experimentalists,
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.400]   they understood the theory well enough to make predictions
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:38.560]   or to explore the predictions
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:40.880]   and the consequences of those predictions.
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:43.200]   Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:46.000]   Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.200]   And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser.
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:52.880]   So he had practically, it wasn't just pure airy-fairy,
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:55.240]   quantum reality and expanding universe.
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:58.520]   So in this case, what I wanna do is look at,
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:00.040]   there's 10 different theories of everything
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:01.520]   or cosmological models.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:02.400]   They make predictions,
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:04.080]   they have advantages and disadvantages.
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:05.600]   And I'm just asking the question,
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:07.880]   why aren't we applying Bayesian reasoning
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:09.040]   with confidence intervals?
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:10.080]   Why don't we have updates?
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.000]   Every time an experiment comes out,
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.240]   we can update our credulity in that experiment
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:15.320]   or that theory rather,
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:17.240]   based on the results of the experiment.
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:18.960]   And we shouldn't do it after the fact,
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:20.880]   or as Michio Kaku has said,
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:23.920]   "Well, you have to tell me what the initial conditions are.
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:24.800]   "And that's not my job.
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:26.680]   "You're supposed to tell me if string theory is correct,
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:29.480]   "what should it predict if it's true?"
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:31.680]   There's one big problem, which I should say,
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:34.360]   that to be a good ass-heir,
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:39.360]   I think you have to be worldly in the sense of,
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:41.320]   worldly and curious,
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:44.160]   like we were talking about before with you and Joe.
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:47.480]   You can't only talk your own book.
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:49.680]   You can't only understand
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:52.280]   your own pet theory of everything.
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:53.440]   You can't only say,
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.760]   "Well, I only understand string theory,
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:58.440]   "and I don't have time for these other theories."
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:01.580]   Or as if it's beneath me to even go into,
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:05.260]   Garrett Lisey or Eric Weinstein or Stephen Wolfram,
[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:08.060]   or aspects of M-theory, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:09.820]   And there are some that say,
[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:14.820]   why do we give string theory so much of an advanced pass
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:18.340]   when there are actually predictions it's made
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:21.620]   that are completely anathema to what we observe in physics?
[02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:23.740]   Like the dark energy should be negative,
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.460]   and we see it as positive.
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:26.500]   That's a huge strike.
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:28.900]   If you told somebody, "Here's my tenure application,"
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:30.340]   and one day it'll be, "Oh, I've made this prediction."
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:33.620]   If it wasn't done by Maldacena and Witten
[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:34.780]   and folks like that,
[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:36.940]   I don't know if it would have had the traction,
[02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:38.940]   the endurance, the resiliency that it's had.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:40.060]   And that worries me,
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:42.780]   because all these men and some women
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:46.140]   are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas,
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:48.540]   and they're not even looking at what their neighbor's doing.
[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:51.980]   - There's a thing that I really enjoyed seeing
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:54.600]   and that I don't see often enough with these theories,
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:58.220]   which is others who are also experts
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:01.740]   kind of studying them sufficiently well
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:04.060]   to steel man the theory,
[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:06.560]   to show the beautiful aspects of the theory.
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:09.860]   You know, I see that with Stephen Wolfram.
[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:14.860]   He has a very different sort of formulation of physics
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:17.140]   with his physics project.
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:21.380]   Now, physics is a foreign land to me,
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:23.560]   but his formulation,
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.040]   especially in the context of cellular automata or hypergraphs
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.820]   just as objects, as mathematical objects themselves
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:30.780]   are familiar.
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:33.500]   And so I'm able to see the real beauty there,
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:38.500]   and it saddens me that others in the physics community
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:41.200]   can't also see the beauty.
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:42.820]   Like, give it a chance.
[02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:44.340]   Give a chance to see the beauty.
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:45.780]   - Give it your respect.
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:48.700]   So there is one person who does take time
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:51.780]   and is what I consider to be a great scientist
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:53.220]   in terms of what he thinks.
[02:47:53.220 --> 02:47:55.820]   He obviously has invested interest in his own theory,
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:56.660]   and it's Eric.
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:00.520]   Eric's got a truly encyclopedic knowledge
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:02.240]   of the history of physics,
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.240]   and he has a great warmth and graciousness
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:08.160]   when it comes to giving others.
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:09.900]   And I've witnessed this, and I've had,
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:11.900]   look, first of all, I think debate is pointless.
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:12.880]   Like, I don't know about you,
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:14.440]   but if you've ever voted like,
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:15.520]   oh, I saw this debate,
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:17.640]   and because Trump did so badly,
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:18.480]   now I'm gonna vote for Biden.
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:19.320]   No, never have.
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.360]   You almost never change anybody's mind
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:23.080]   unless you debate with love,
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:25.240]   unless you have almost like,
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:26.740]   we're gonna win together,
[02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.860]   like the red team approach in the military.
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:30.340]   They're trying to win a war.
[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:33.340]   So they may disagree on the tactics day to day,
[02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:35.140]   but the strategy, we have to win this war.
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:37.620]   I love you, and I wanna protect you.
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.740]   I don't see that in very many of these physicists.
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:41.420]   From Kaku, I almost see it,
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:42.780]   it's embarrassing in some ways,
[02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:44.520]   'cause they'll almost mock.
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:45.860]   With the exception of Eric,
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:47.140]   you know, Garrett's interesting.
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:48.420]   You know, his theory is, you know,
[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:51.620]   people have a lot of issues, very technical.
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:54.660]   But Eric has taken the time to try to understand it.
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:57.360]   Eric has taken the time to understand Peter White's theory.
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:01.080]   And I don't see the same graciousness extended from them,
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:01.920]   I'm sorry to say.
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:03.220]   - Yeah, you're right, you're right.
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:05.940]   I mean, with Eric, he wants to,
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:08.040]   but he hasn't extended the same for Stephen Wolfram,
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.920]   because I think--
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:10.760]   - No, he didn't.
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:11.580]   No, actually, no, he did.
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:13.520]   I had a debate with them live on my show.
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:14.700]   - No, I did, I listened to it,
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:17.560]   but I just think it's outside of the toolkit
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:19.180]   that Eric is comfortable with.
[02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:21.120]   So it's not that he's not,
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.360]   but the main thing that's often absent
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:28.440]   and Eric does have is the willingness,
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:31.120]   and not just dismissing or mocking the other,
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:32.320]   he's reaching out.
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:33.160]   But, okay.
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:34.840]   - I mean, what if it's not,
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:36.080]   you know, I made a joke when they were on,
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.320]   I was like, how many theories of everything can there be?
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.720]   You know, Highlander, you know, there can be only one.
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:42.180]   You know, I don't know, maybe.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:44.520]   - But he, of course, also, like the other folks
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:48.600]   who propose a theory, has an ego.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:52.780]   He rides a dragon,
[02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:55.460]   with the dragon representing the ego.
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:59.140]   Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.
[02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:03.540]   So he proposed initial sketches of geometric unity,
[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:05.180]   which is his theory of everything.
[02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:07.820]   Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:08.980]   that you find interesting,
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:13.980]   but what do you think about the response he got
[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:17.700]   from the scientific community?
[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:20.940]   - Well, you know, some of the response came from people,
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:22.700]   academicians, professors.
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:24.580]   Some came from a lay audience,
[02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:26.780]   and some came from trained scientists,
[02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:27.700]   who are no longer, you know,
[02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:29.540]   maybe practicing in the universities.
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:33.320]   I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol,
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:34.860]   which surprised me,
[02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:38.160]   because I look at what he's trying to do,
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:41.500]   and it was always, the vitriol would always come
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:43.180]   with some element of ad hominem,
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:45.820]   and maybe that's his personality,
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:48.180]   maybe that engenders this, or whatever.
[02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:50.820]   Maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency.
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:52.100]   You know, I always get these emails,
[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.660]   Professor Keating, I have a new theory,
[02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:56.660]   Einstein was wrong, I'm gonna prove it,
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:50:59.100]   I'm not good at math, but if you help me,
[02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:01.620]   I will share my Nobel Prize with you.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:03.420]   I'm like, oh, thanks, have you read my books?
[02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:07.460]   In other words, it's always taking down the dragon,
[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:09.880]   it's always taking down the Kung Fu master, right?
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:11.580]   That you get the hit points from D&D,
[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.060]   you get their hit points, you take their cards,
[02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:15.480]   you get their risk tokens from Kamchaka,
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:18.300]   and thinking about, with Eric, it's like,
[02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:21.180]   because what he's doing is so aspirational,
[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:22.940]   it is grandiose in a good sense.
[02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:25.060]   What he's trying to do is construct
[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:26.900]   a geometric theory of everything
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:28.740]   that has aspects of supersymmetry
[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:30.220]   and stuff embedded in it.
[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:34.400]   He's trying to meld that, it has very unusual features,
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:37.260]   in that it features not only multiple spatial dimensions,
[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:40.780]   multiple time dimensions, it uses new mathematical objects
[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:42.900]   that he's invented.
[02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:46.660]   And look, I had him on my show, I've talked with him,
[02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.100]   we've had consultations with other physicists,
[02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:50.540]   you know, where he'll come down,
[02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:51.860]   and I have a visitor's office,
[02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:53.480]   and he comes down to San Diego sometimes,
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:54.840]   and spends time there.
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:58.440]   And we talk with eminent mathematicians and physicists.
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:02.620]   Eric's been out of the academic world for a long time,
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:04.420]   and there is, as I said before,
[02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:07.460]   an aspect of persuasion that must take place
[02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:08.860]   in order to get anything through.
[02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:12.780]   And I think there was a slight amount of good nature,
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:15.700]   not ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that
[02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:18.220]   if this is right, everyone will recognize it.
[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:19.700]   If you build a better mousetrap,
[02:52:19.700 --> 02:52:21.620]   the world will beat a path to your door,
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:22.700]   as the expression goes.
[02:52:22.700 --> 02:52:23.740]   That's completely untrue.
[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:25.740]   That doesn't even happen with mousetraps.
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:27.420]   I mean, you know how many frickin' mousetrap types
[02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:28.260]   there are?
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:29.980]   It's like, no, they don't beat a path to your door.
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.800]   You have to sell that frickin' thing.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:34.860]   You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or Elon.
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:37.620]   I have never, I've had one paper out of 200 papers
[02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:39.420]   I've published in peer-reviewed journals.
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:41.540]   I've only had one, half a percent,
[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:43.860]   published with no referees' comments.
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:45.380]   In other words, published like a dream,
[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:47.700]   I submitted it, it happened to be in a prestigious journal.
[02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:49.460]   I was pretty psyched about that.
[02:52:49.460 --> 02:52:51.260]   But you almost have to crave the response,
[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.580]   getting it back from a journal.
[02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:54.220]   And I think he doesn't, first of all,
[02:52:54.220 --> 02:52:56.380]   he doesn't subscribe to the peer-review process.
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:59.100]   He thinks that is anathema to the way science is,
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:02.500]   it invests interest in journals, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:06.340]   I think you can have elements of peer-review
[02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:08.780]   that are substantive and valuable.
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:10.800]   I think you have to learn from your critics.
[02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:12.780]   One of my conversations with John Mather,
[02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:15.700]   he talks about loving your critics in this book,
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:17.780]   but not being so open to their criticism
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:19.940]   that their criticism goes to your heart,
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:22.540]   and not being so open to their compliments
[02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:24.700]   that their compliments go to your head.
[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.580]   It's a very tough scylla and charybdis to walk.
[02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:29.700]   - Well, there's something, I mean,
[02:53:29.700 --> 02:53:33.020]   I wanna be careful here because I'd like to talk to Eric
[02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:37.100]   about this directly, but I'll just,
[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.540]   from a perspective of a friend,
[02:53:39.540 --> 02:53:43.380]   when I ask about the
[02:53:43.380 --> 02:53:47.460]   the drug of fame,
[02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:50.500]   so there's also the public
[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:56.580]   perception of the battles of physics.
[02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:58.740]   And so there's a very narrow community,
[02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:01.940]   but then there's the way that's perceived,
[02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:06.220]   the exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:10.780]   And so there is a certain drug to the excitement
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:13.060]   that the public can show
[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:15.600]   when they sense that you have something big.
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:18.660]   And that in itself
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:23.660]   might become the thing that gives you pleasure.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:27.880]   And I think that with theories of everything,
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:30.620]   or with any kind of super, super ambitious projects,
[02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:34.620]   and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious
[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:37.780]   about trying to understand the origins of the universe,
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:41.380]   if you convince yourself that you have an intuition
[02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:43.780]   about the origins of the universe,
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:47.420]   and you have a platform, like you do now,
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:50.820]   where you start to communicate your intuition,
[02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:54.460]   it's hazy, like all the science, you're still unsure,
[02:54:54.460 --> 02:54:56.020]   but you have a sense, I mean,
[02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:58.540]   perhaps you don't have that as much as an experimentalist
[02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:00.380]   'cause you always kind of start going,
[02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:02.140]   okay, how can I build a device
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:05.980]   to see through the fog?
[02:55:05.980 --> 02:55:08.340]   But if you're more like a theoretician
[02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:11.140]   who kind of works in the realm of ideas,
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:13.100]   in the realm of intuitions,
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:16.820]   it is also a source of pleasure.
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:18.420]   You mentioned dopamine.
[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:22.620]   A source of dopamine that you can communicate to others
[02:55:22.620 --> 02:55:25.940]   that you're really excited by the possibility
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:28.780]   of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.
[02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:32.340]   So there's some aspect to which you want to be
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.500]   a Grigori Grisha Perlman,
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:38.580]   and go into the hole and get the work done,
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:40.660]   and shut the hell up about the,
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:41.980]   I'm speaking about myself,
[02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:46.820]   about talking about the dream and planning and exploring
[02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:49.780]   how great it will be if my intuition
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:51.700]   turns out to be correct.
[02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:54.780]   If the sketches I have turn out
[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:56.540]   to actually build the bridge
[02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:58.660]   that takes us to a whole new place.
[02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:01.100]   As a friend of Eric's,
[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:05.460]   or a friend of, or my friend,
[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:08.660]   what kind of advice do you give?
[02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:10.020]   What is your role?
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:12.060]   Is it to be a supporter,
[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:14.300]   given that he has many critics?
[02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:18.940]   Or is it to be in private a critic?
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:20.220]   Like a lot of my friends will say,
[02:56:20.220 --> 02:56:22.060]   "Hey, shut the hell up.
[02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:22.940]   "Just get it done."
[02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:24.260]   - Well, first of all, I wanna ask you
[02:56:24.260 --> 02:56:25.740]   a question I've asked him.
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:29.700]   And it comes from Animal Farm by George--
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:31.460]   - Probably my favorite book, yeah.
[02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:32.980]   - So you remember Benjamin the donkey?
[02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:33.820]   - Yes.
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:35.180]   - And he's talking to the pig.
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:37.220]   I forget the pig's name, you probably know.
[02:56:37.220 --> 02:56:38.060]   Anyway, the pig says to him,
[02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:41.220]   "You got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail.
[02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:42.060]   "You're so lucky.
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:44.460]   "I got this short, curly, little squiggly thing
[02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:46.340]   "that does jack squat.
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:49.460]   "Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous tail?"
[02:56:49.460 --> 02:56:52.140]   And Benjamin says, "Well, the good Lord,
[02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:56.260]   "He gave me a tail to swat away the flies."
[02:56:56.260 --> 02:56:57.420]   But you know what?
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:01.500]   I'd rather not have the tail if I didn't have the flies.
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:04.460]   So I wanna ask you, as I've asked Eric,
[02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:05.300]   is it worth it?
[02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:09.940]   You've got these beautiful tail, but there are flies.
[02:57:09.940 --> 02:57:11.260]   I'm not saying in a negative way.
[02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:14.500]   I'm just saying you get unwanted distractions,
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:18.900]   dopamine, it's kind of the highlight, the spotlight effect.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:21.020]   It's obviously allowing you to do things
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:22.460]   that you could never do alone.
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:24.860]   And I think, first of all,
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:26.140]   I'd love to know how you answer that.
[02:57:26.140 --> 02:57:29.380]   'Cause that's something I don't feel I can relate to myself.
[02:57:29.380 --> 02:57:33.580]   - Well, this has to do with more like--
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:34.420]   - Platform.
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:36.820]   - With the scale. - Platform stuff.
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:37.860]   Oh, I...
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:42.580]   That has no, very little effect on me.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:46.620]   I enjoy meeting new people,
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:48.380]   but that has nothing to do with platform.
[02:57:48.380 --> 02:57:50.260]   Yeah, no, that has no effect on me.
[02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:57.020]   I'm one somebody that enjoys the act itself.
[02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:58.340]   So this conversation,
[02:57:58.340 --> 02:58:01.180]   the reason I'm doing this podcast with you today
[02:58:01.180 --> 02:58:03.780]   is because that allows me to trick you
[02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:05.660]   into talking to me for a long period of time.
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:07.020]   I don't care about platform.
[02:58:07.020 --> 02:58:08.420]   I assume nobody listens.
[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:09.900]   It really doesn't matter.
[02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:11.100]   - Yeah, I forgot to write.
[02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:13.460]   My whole test of it was a good podcast.
[02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:14.300]   How do you know?
[02:58:14.300 --> 02:58:15.980]   Like podcast's been around, what, 12 years?
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:18.300]   How do we know as podcasters we're doing a good job?
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:19.140]   Like sometimes someone will say,
[02:58:19.140 --> 02:58:20.420]   "That was the best interview I ever had,"
[02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:22.620]   but that doesn't happen that often, at least for me.
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:26.580]   But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:29.380]   in that little guy and the Zoom didn't work,
[02:58:29.380 --> 02:58:30.440]   would you do it again?
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:32.220]   And I think if you say yes to that,
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:33.100]   that was a good podcast.
[02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:33.940]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:35.060]   That's exactly it.
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:40.060]   So in that space, yeah, all of it is worth it.
[02:58:40.060 --> 02:58:45.820]   But the dream, I'm more referring
[02:58:45.820 --> 02:58:47.900]   to the psychological effects.
[02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:50.300]   Forget the platform, forget all of that.
[02:58:50.300 --> 02:58:52.620]   You know, maybe I shouldn't even brought up the platform
[02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:53.740]   'cause it really has to do,
[02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:55.900]   even in your own private mind,
[02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:57.620]   which is what I'm struggling with,
[02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:04.100]   I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages
[02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:11.700]   so much that I often don't take projects to completion.
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:14.080]   This is a psychological effect
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:16.560]   that I'm sure basically everybody, every engineer,
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.800]   everybody that does anything goes through.
[02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:22.780]   I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies.
[02:59:22.780 --> 02:59:25.480]   And I wonder as a friend, what is the role?
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:27.520]   - So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented.
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:30.260]   Everything from planning telescopes to dieting.
[02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:34.020]   So there's a tiny bit of dopamine that you get
[02:59:34.020 --> 02:59:36.020]   visualizing how you're gonna feel.
[02:59:36.020 --> 02:59:38.020]   You don't need to know this, but you don't deal,
[02:59:38.020 --> 02:59:39.340]   but losing five pounds.
[02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:40.940]   I say, oh, I'm gonna lose five pounds
[02:59:40.940 --> 02:59:43.340]   and I'm gonna be able to run a minute faster.
[02:59:43.340 --> 02:59:45.460]   So there's a part of me when I'm planning the diet
[02:59:45.460 --> 02:59:47.100]   and the meals and the exercise
[02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:49.220]   that I get a little bit of that thrill
[02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:51.300]   and that actually saps a little bit of my willpower
[02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:52.140]   to actually complete the task
[02:59:52.140 --> 02:59:53.500]   that will take me to that goal.
[02:59:53.500 --> 02:59:54.660]   So that's a documented effect.
[02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:57.920]   And that happens in project planning and project management.
[02:59:57.920 --> 03:00:00.560]   It's a very, very important thing to guard against
[03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:02.640]   as a manager of a big project.
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:05.720]   With Eric, it's interesting because with him,
[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:08.800]   first of all, we relate extremely well
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:11.880]   on a friendship level and very close.
[03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:14.280]   He does remind me a lot of my father.
[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:17.360]   And I've told him that just as a mathematician,
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:21.600]   as a big thinker, as in his case, as a father,
[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:24.520]   the father kind of figure that I didn't have in a sense.
[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:27.260]   But that he is a true lover of life.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:28.900]   He knows he's got a huge platform.
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:31.540]   He knows he gets a lot of attention for what he does.
[03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:34.740]   And I jokingly say, well, it's one thing,
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:37.100]   like how do you know, Lex, that someone's an expert?
[03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:39.060]   So experts say.
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:41.440]   There's a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in "Principles."
[03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:42.500]   He says, "An expert is someone
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:44.960]   "who's done something three times successfully."
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:47.220]   Like you can do something correctly once,
[03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:48.500]   you could do something correctly.
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:51.220]   It's very hard to pull off like three projects,
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:53.940]   three telescopes, three whatever, right?
[03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:56.300]   So look for, it's arbitrary,
[03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:58.460]   it could be four, it could be two, right?
[03:00:58.460 --> 03:00:59.740]   But the point is, look at Eric.
[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:01.500]   So how many things has he contributed to
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:05.820]   and made pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:06.820]   for different people?
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:09.180]   I would say he's been right many times.
[03:01:09.180 --> 03:01:11.420]   Does that mean he's infallible, that he's ineffable?
[03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:12.740]   No, of course not.
[03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:15.180]   For me, so what I'm saying is I get a little bit
[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:19.120]   of the joy of kind of learning something purely
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:21.660]   as a scientist, something completely outside
[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:25.260]   of what I do, mathematics, gauge theory,
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:29.700]   the kind of very advanced geometry,
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:31.860]   topology that he's interested in.
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:35.500]   But every now and then, I will sneak in that I want,
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:36.940]   you know, I've told him, I'm gonna turn your son
[03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:38.540]   into an experimentalist despite you.
[03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:40.300]   You know, like he is not gonna be a theorist.
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:41.300]   Zev is not gonna be a theorist.
[03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:43.460]   He is working with me, he is learning from me.
[03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:46.300]   We're trying to get him into, he wants to bypass
[03:01:46.300 --> 03:01:48.700]   all of the kind of nonsense of undergraduate
[03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:50.140]   and go straight to graduate school.
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:52.580]   And I've tried to encourage him that maybe he could do it,
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:55.180]   maybe he can't, but there's no other way than to try.
[03:01:55.180 --> 03:01:57.660]   And so I've prepared a whole curriculum for Zev
[03:01:57.660 --> 03:01:59.620]   to basically bypass all of undergraduate.
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:01.980]   And to his credit, he's earned all the credit.
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:04.020]   He's learned it to a level that matches
[03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:05.100]   many of my graduates.
[03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:06.020]   - Okay, hold on a second.
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:08.500]   I have to push back and this is me saying it
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:11.620]   and I'm sure I'll talk to Eric about this.
[03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:15.740]   But to say, you said Eric's done,
[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:19.260]   was right on multiple things.
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:24.260]   I think Eric has a great deep insight about human nature
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:27.660]   and how societies work.
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:31.460]   And he says a lot of wise words on that world.
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:34.740]   But I think if we're talking about experts,
[03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:36.180]   you kind of have to prove, you know,
[03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:38.520]   it's like Michael Jordan playing baseball.
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:42.140]   Like he's proved it many times that he can play basketball,
[03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:44.500]   but he's also got to prove that he can play baseball.
[03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:49.500]   And I would say the whole point of radical ideas
[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:53.820]   is you're not, I mean, it's very hard to be sitting
[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:55.900]   on a track record.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:58.100]   When you're swinging for the fences always,
[03:02:58.100 --> 03:03:00.840]   there's not a track record to sit on.
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:05.240]   And like Max Tegmark is an example of somebody
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:09.300]   who has a huge track record of more like acceptable stuff,
[03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:11.500]   but he also keeps swinging for the fences
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:12.940]   in every other world.
[03:03:12.940 --> 03:03:14.780]   So he has that track record.
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:17.700]   With Eric, if you look at just the number of publications,
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:20.640]   all this stuff, he really, he chose not to travel
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:21.480]   the academic route.
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:26.180]   So there's no proof of expertise except sort of
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:30.980]   an obvious linguistic demonstration of brilliance.
[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:32.860]   But that's not how physics works, right?
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:35.300]   - There's a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:37.780]   and say he or she, they really know
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:40.060]   the history of physics very well.
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:41.220]   Like, physics is always lovely.
[03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:43.260]   Sean Carroll always jokes about,
[03:03:43.260 --> 03:03:46.460]   physicists should never talk about history of physics.
[03:03:46.460 --> 03:03:47.540]   But it's more than that.
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:52.540]   So Eric has certainly contributed in finance specifically,
[03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:57.400]   and gauge theory and economics and inflation dynamics
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:58.240]   and non-cosmological--
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:03:59.660]   - But that's yet, hold on a second,
[03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:00.940]   that's yet to be proven.
[03:04:00.940 --> 03:04:02.780]   He has a lot of powerful--
[03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:04.940]   - But gauge theory is calculus, it's calculus proven.
[03:04:04.940 --> 03:04:09.940]   I mean, he has a gauge model for currency exchanges
[03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:13.540]   between different nations that is explanatory.
[03:04:13.540 --> 03:04:16.700]   It's not, you know, is this something,
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:18.340]   in other words, it's a model,
[03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:20.140]   and it's used for pedagogical purposes.
[03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:21.860]   - And it might be, okay.
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:23.860]   - It's unique to him, I mean, him and Pia.
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:25.220]   - Yes, right.
[03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:27.540]   It might be a powerful model.
[03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:29.620]   It might be one that actually deserves
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:32.400]   a huge amount of applause and celebration,
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.180]   but does not yet receive that.
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:35.980]   And that's one of the things that Eric talks about,
[03:04:35.980 --> 03:04:38.020]   it has not received the attention it deserves.
[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:41.020]   But it has not yet received the attention it deserves.
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:43.700]   And so like the proven expertise thing,
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:47.140]   I mean, there's a lot of people that go to their grave
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:50.420]   without the recognition they deserve, and it's a tragedy.
[03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:54.420]   But the fact is, like, you have to fight
[03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:55.700]   for that recognition.
[03:04:55.700 --> 03:04:57.280]   The tragedy happens for a reason.
[03:04:57.280 --> 03:05:00.700]   You can't just say, this person is obviously brilliant,
[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:03.380]   and therefore they deserve the credit
[03:05:03.380 --> 03:05:06.940]   in every single domain.
[03:05:06.940 --> 03:05:09.420]   It doesn't like transfer immediately.
[03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:12.020]   There's nobody that's, well, at least I wouldn't argue,
[03:05:12.020 --> 03:05:15.540]   Eric is one of the special minds in our generation.
[03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:18.740]   But you still have to fight the fight of physics
[03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.420]   and prove it within the community.
[03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:22.740]   And I think the same applies in economics.
[03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:26.260]   You can't, I mean, as somebody that,
[03:05:26.260 --> 03:05:30.780]   I've gone through the academic journey,
[03:05:30.780 --> 03:05:33.340]   just like you said, the peer review,
[03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:35.860]   all of those things, flawed as they are,
[03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:37.580]   that's the part of the process.
[03:05:37.580 --> 03:05:39.460]   You have to convince your peers,
[03:05:39.460 --> 03:05:42.620]   the people that are as obsessed,
[03:05:42.620 --> 03:05:44.140]   for whatever the hell reason,
[03:05:44.140 --> 03:05:46.700]   about that particular thing that you're working on.
[03:05:46.700 --> 03:05:48.020]   Yes, there's egos.
[03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:49.260]   Yes, there's politics.
[03:05:49.260 --> 03:05:50.900]   It's a giant mess.
[03:05:50.900 --> 03:05:52.820]   But I think it's a beautiful mess
[03:05:52.820 --> 03:05:56.180]   through which you have to go through
[03:05:56.180 --> 03:06:00.540]   in order to reveal the power of your idea
[03:06:00.540 --> 03:06:02.500]   to yourself and to the world.
[03:06:02.500 --> 03:06:03.380]   - Well, let me use an example.
[03:06:03.380 --> 03:06:05.980]   So you know of James Clerk Maxwell,
[03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:08.500]   and he invented the laws of electromagnetism,
[03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:10.780]   which is the first example of a unification principle
[03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:13.460]   ever displayed by the human mind in history.
[03:06:13.460 --> 03:06:16.500]   Purely mathematics, unifying
[03:06:16.500 --> 03:06:17.900]   completely disparate phenomena.
[03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:20.300]   In one case, electricity charges,
[03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:21.900]   static electricity, lightning,
[03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:23.420]   and the other magnets, bar magnets,
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:25.220]   currents, et cetera, unify them.
[03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:27.100]   You know what he did?
[03:06:27.100 --> 03:06:28.700]   I like to do a thought experiment.
[03:06:28.700 --> 03:06:31.020]   Imagine Twitter exists 1864.
[03:06:31.020 --> 03:06:32.700]   Maxwell's working away, and he goes,
[03:06:32.700 --> 03:06:34.820]   "I have this wonderful idea with fluxions
[03:06:34.820 --> 03:06:37.660]   "and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah,
[03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:39.860]   "and it revolves on this thing called an ether.
[03:06:39.860 --> 03:06:42.700]   "And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears,
[03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:44.380]   "and the gears have these planetary things,
[03:06:44.380 --> 03:06:45.380]   "and they suck up vortices,
[03:06:45.380 --> 03:06:46.900]   "and the vortices determine the density
[03:06:46.900 --> 03:06:49.020]   "of the electromagnetic potential."
[03:06:49.020 --> 03:06:51.140]   You'd be like, "This guy's a freaking moron."
[03:06:51.140 --> 03:06:52.500]   And what would you do?
[03:06:52.500 --> 03:06:53.820]   Come on, honestly, you would say
[03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:55.580]   everything this guy does is wrong.
[03:06:55.580 --> 03:06:57.300]   I mean, he's got this idiotic idea.
[03:06:57.300 --> 03:07:00.100]   And it would be falsified a couple decades later
[03:07:00.100 --> 03:07:02.060]   by Michelson and Morley.
[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:04.540]   And in so doing, you would have thrown out
[03:07:04.540 --> 03:07:07.420]   a very beautiful baby with bathwater.
[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:09.420]   Or imagine Twitter, imagine the twitstorm
[03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:13.660]   @ClerkMaxwell1 would get.
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:14.980]   It would be brutal, right?
[03:07:14.980 --> 03:07:17.580]   And to the detriment, and that might even set back history.
[03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:19.340]   Imagine Yang Mills doing the same thing,
[03:07:19.340 --> 03:07:22.180]   Chern, Simons, a lot of these things are very fantastic.
[03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:23.260]   But why, Lex?
[03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:26.660]   Why does Ed Witten, why does Juan Maldacena,
[03:07:26.660 --> 03:07:28.900]   let me give a good example, Juan Gast,
[03:07:28.900 --> 03:07:30.700]   brilliant guy, I love him.
[03:07:30.700 --> 03:07:33.500]   He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded
[03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:36.380]   his black hole information paradox loss issue.
[03:07:36.380 --> 03:07:40.300]   What did he concede based upon Maldacena's calculation
[03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:43.900]   in ADS-CFT and five-dimensional wormholes?
[03:07:43.900 --> 03:07:47.420]   Is any of that, first of all, we don't live in an ADS universe.
[03:07:47.420 --> 03:07:49.940]   Second of all, we don't know if wormholes are traversable,
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:51.860]   if they exist even.
[03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:52.980]   These are devices, you know,
[03:07:52.980 --> 03:07:55.140]   Kip Thorne has popularized for movies.
[03:07:55.140 --> 03:07:56.980]   Like, to say that this is something
[03:07:56.980 --> 03:07:58.300]   on which I will concede a bet,
[03:07:58.300 --> 03:08:00.820]   no, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.
[03:08:00.820 --> 03:08:04.460]   Why does Maldacena, and he's got a pretty high H-index,
[03:08:04.460 --> 03:08:06.540]   pretty well-respected guy at IAS,
[03:08:06.540 --> 03:08:08.220]   love talking to him, brilliant guy.
[03:08:08.220 --> 03:08:12.180]   By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia's work
[03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:14.300]   on gauge theory and economics,
[03:08:14.300 --> 03:08:16.540]   originally and won, I believe, the Breakthrough Prize,
[03:08:16.540 --> 03:08:17.620]   I can't remember exactly what,
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:20.580]   but partially credit some of the work that he did,
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:23.980]   which appears there's a footnote to Pia Malani's thesis
[03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:26.340]   and some conversations with Eric, I think, in it.
[03:08:26.340 --> 03:08:27.820]   Anyway, getting back to that,
[03:08:27.820 --> 03:08:30.300]   why is there not the same skeptic?
[03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:32.060]   Is it because Maldacena,
[03:08:32.060 --> 03:08:34.140]   who's an eminent physicist, obviously,
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:37.380]   has published realistic work and done,
[03:08:37.380 --> 03:08:38.620]   what about Witten?
[03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:40.020]   You know, Witten gets a pass.
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:40.860]   I mean, if you--
[03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:42.860]   - Well, Witten gets a pass on which aspect,
[03:08:42.860 --> 03:08:43.700]   the string theory?
[03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:45.220]   - Well, yeah, that M-theory is correct.
[03:08:45.220 --> 03:08:46.580]   I mean, here's, let me just say Hawking.
[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:48.420]   Hawking gets the ultimate pass.
[03:08:48.420 --> 03:08:50.820]   Hawking would say things like M-theory,
[03:08:50.820 --> 03:08:52.140]   there's zero evidence for it.
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:53.540]   I mean, there's the famous meme
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:54.420]   that went around this weekend,
[03:08:54.420 --> 03:08:56.140]   like, what is string theory predicted?
[03:08:56.140 --> 03:08:56.980]   And it's nothing.
[03:08:56.980 --> 03:08:57.900]   By the way, that's actually wrong.
[03:08:57.900 --> 03:08:59.780]   I talked to Cumrun, I know you talked to Cumrun.
[03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:02.260]   Cumrun says that string theory does make predictions.
[03:09:02.260 --> 03:09:03.540]   It predicts the mass of the electron
[03:09:03.540 --> 03:09:05.980]   lies between 10 to the minus one Planck mass
[03:09:05.980 --> 03:09:07.620]   and 10 to the minus 30 Planck mass.
[03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:09.620]   Okay, whatever, you know, our electron.
[03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:10.460]   - It's a big range.
[03:09:10.460 --> 03:09:11.700]   - It's a huge range.
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:13.500]   Is that, imagine Cumrun comes up,
[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:15.620]   and again, he's just some nobody,
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:17.180]   but he actually, you know, he doesn't have a profile.
[03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:18.460]   He's not at Harvard.
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:21.300]   Has zero H-index or whatever Eric's is.
[03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:22.980]   Why do we not, like, in other words,
[03:09:22.980 --> 03:09:25.820]   why are we more harsh on people that are trying?
[03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:27.580]   - You know the answer to that.
[03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:30.620]   So I get a million emails just like you said,
[03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:33.460]   you yourself, where they provenize,
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:36.020]   in my world, it's artificial intelligence,
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:38.020]   the equivalence of that.
[03:09:38.020 --> 03:09:40.420]   I figured out how to build consciousness,
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:44.420]   how to engineer intelligence, how to, and sometimes--
[03:09:44.420 --> 03:09:45.860]   - You should send your emails to me,
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:46.700]   and I'll send my emails to you.
[03:09:46.700 --> 03:09:48.020]   - And we'll reply to you.
[03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:50.380]   I mean, and I don't want to sort of mock this,
[03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:52.380]   because I think it's very possible
[03:09:52.380 --> 03:09:55.620]   that there is either kernels of interesting ideas
[03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:58.860]   or in whole, like, there is geniuses out there
[03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:03.020]   that are unheard, but because there's so much noise,
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:06.700]   you do have to weigh, like,
[03:10:06.700 --> 03:10:10.500]   higher the Ed Wittens of the world
[03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:12.260]   when they make statements,
[03:10:12.260 --> 03:10:14.820]   and that's why you build up a track record.
[03:10:14.820 --> 03:10:16.860]   As you said with Ray Dalio,
[03:10:16.860 --> 03:10:20.260]   you have to show that you can,
[03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:24.420]   like, if you're Pollock, and you show us a painting
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:26.980]   of a bunch of chaos, you have to,
[03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:28.460]   and this is a bad example, probably,
[03:10:28.460 --> 03:10:29.940]   because he probably never showed this proof.
[03:10:29.940 --> 03:10:30.780]   - I think he could do it, right?
[03:10:30.780 --> 03:10:31.620]   - Yeah.
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:32.460]   - Impressionist master.
[03:10:32.460 --> 03:10:36.580]   - It's much more comforting to see
[03:10:36.580 --> 03:10:39.780]   that they can paint a good, accurate picture--
[03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:40.620]   - Of still life.
[03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:43.420]   - Of still life, of an apple on the table.
[03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:44.260]   So there's--
[03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:45.220]   - Meteorite and a--
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:46.340]   - Because then, I mean,
[03:10:46.340 --> 03:10:49.980]   because then there's something
[03:10:49.980 --> 03:10:51.380]   about the scientific community
[03:10:51.380 --> 03:10:54.820]   that they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor
[03:10:54.820 --> 03:10:57.220]   to where they're not going to give the full effort
[03:10:57.220 --> 03:11:00.220]   of their attention if you don't have the track record.
[03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:02.580]   Now, you could say that's a kind of club
[03:11:02.580 --> 03:11:04.300]   that only, you have to, like,
[03:11:04.300 --> 03:11:05.860]   you have to have 10, you have to have this,
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:08.780]   yes, that exists, but there's some aspect
[03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:11.580]   in which you have to play the game a little bit
[03:11:11.580 --> 03:11:13.860]   to get the machine of science going.
[03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:16.500]   Otherwise, if you're always saying,
[03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:20.140]   "Well, I have my ball, and I don't wanna play your game.
[03:11:20.140 --> 03:11:23.500]   "Your game sucks," then nobody's gonna wanna play with you.
[03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:26.220]   - That's true, and look, inherent in all of this
[03:11:26.220 --> 03:11:28.100]   is an underlying grandiosity.
[03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:31.500]   Look, how could you talk about doing what Kaku said
[03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:33.500]   on here and elsewhere?
[03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:34.980]   We're looking for the umbilical cord
[03:11:34.980 --> 03:11:36.860]   that connects our universe to another universe
[03:11:36.860 --> 03:11:38.860]   that will then reveal in a one-inch equation
[03:11:38.860 --> 03:11:41.460]   that we'll surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God, the--
[03:11:41.460 --> 03:11:42.980]   - That's like a prerequisite, I guess,
[03:11:42.980 --> 03:11:44.180]   to tackle these questions.
[03:11:44.180 --> 03:11:46.980]   - I think it's detrimental.
[03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:48.860]   I think doing that, first of all,
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:50.780]   I think there's an element of almost snarkiness,
[03:11:50.780 --> 03:11:54.540]   'cause none of these scientists are believing Gnostics.
[03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:55.720]   They're not theists, right?
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:57.660]   So they're using it as kind of a stand-in,
[03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:58.860]   and they always talk about Einstein,
[03:11:58.860 --> 03:12:02.060]   and he was like a Spinozan, and he wasn't a theist.
[03:12:02.060 --> 03:12:03.060]   - God doesn't play dice.
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:03.900]   - God doesn't play dice.
[03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:05.220]   - Yeah, Einstein's mentions of God, yeah.
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:07.380]   - Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says,
[03:12:07.380 --> 03:12:09.580]   "If when we get M-theory understood,
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:11.560]   "we'll know the mind of God."
[03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:13.780]   That's the title of Kaku's book,
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:16.360]   the God Particle, the God Equation.
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:19.020]   Do any of them really believe in God?
[03:12:19.020 --> 03:12:20.340]   Now, is that a prerequisite?
[03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:21.420]   No, I'm not saying that.
[03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:24.060]   But the point being, you're talking about something
[03:12:24.060 --> 03:12:25.140]   that has to do with God, right?
[03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:26.580]   I mean, where else do you go from there?
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:29.780]   I mean, I think God, for now, enjoys a little bit more
[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:33.180]   kind of PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right?
[03:12:33.180 --> 03:12:37.300]   So God's got a pretty good H-index himself.
[03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:39.180]   - He has, by the way, a Twitter account,
[03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:40.380]   just so you know, it's pretty good.
[03:12:40.380 --> 03:12:41.340]   - The tweets of God.
[03:12:41.340 --> 03:12:43.320]   - Yeah, the tweets of God.
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:46.020]   - So if you look at that, you have to go in there.
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:47.700]   Again, you have to go in with some swagger.
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:50.380]   You have to have a little bit of arrogance,
[03:12:50.380 --> 03:12:52.820]   but you should, I agree, mix with a little bit of humility.
[03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:55.960]   So he's doing something, he comes from outside of academia.
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:58.240]   Now, if he rails against, I'm talking about Eric now,
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:12:59.620]   if he's just railing, "Oh, the system,
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:01.120]   "and I'm not gonna publish, 'cause F that,
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:03.460]   "and that's only created by greedy journals,"
[03:13:03.460 --> 03:13:05.620]   I don't think he's doing himself any favors.
[03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:07.260]   On the other hand, if he's shopping it,
[03:13:07.260 --> 03:13:10.820]   if he's talking it, if he's willing to expose it
[03:13:10.820 --> 03:13:14.980]   to criticism and to even embrace people
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:18.100]   who may not have the purest intentions, perhaps,
[03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:21.460]   but in the sense of they're not arguing solely
[03:13:21.460 --> 03:13:23.900]   to get to the truth, with a capital T,
[03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:25.660]   what they're trying to do is take down Eric.
[03:13:25.660 --> 03:13:27.660]   Hopefully those people aren't out there.
[03:13:27.660 --> 03:13:31.260]   But on the other hand, looking at what Eric does
[03:13:31.260 --> 03:13:34.540]   for other people, looking at the fact that he has courtesy,
[03:13:34.540 --> 03:13:36.660]   he will look at Wolfram, he will look at Lisey,
[03:13:36.660 --> 03:13:38.000]   who's one of his closest friends.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.260]   I mean, he calls him his, not his aunt.
[03:13:40.260 --> 03:13:41.980]   - Nemesis. - Nemesis, right, right.
[03:13:41.980 --> 03:13:43.120]   And I think that's interesting,
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:44.260]   that they're loving friends.
[03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:46.180]   - I really enjoyed that portal conversation
[03:13:46.180 --> 03:13:49.820]   between Gary Lisey, Eric is torn about that conversation
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:53.340]   because, I guess, because of the nemesis
[03:13:53.340 --> 03:13:56.100]   of the beautiful dance of minds playing with these ideas
[03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:56.940]   and theories of everything.
[03:13:56.940 --> 03:13:57.860]   - Some of these things, you know, look,
[03:13:57.860 --> 03:14:00.660]   so fundamentally, now I may disagree with him,
[03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:02.060]   Eric, on a different aspect,
[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:03.460]   which is the only one I'm capable of,
[03:14:03.460 --> 03:14:05.300]   but let me say one thing, which is experimental,
[03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:06.700]   but let me say one thing.
[03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:08.820]   I understand probably a third
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:10.620]   of what Eric's talking about with GU.
[03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:13.900]   I understand, you know, GR, I understand mathematics,
[03:14:13.900 --> 03:14:16.420]   I understand some group theory, fiber bone,
[03:14:16.420 --> 03:14:19.140]   I can get a little of it, the age theory,
[03:14:19.140 --> 03:14:21.980]   but I also understand what I don't understand,
[03:14:21.980 --> 03:14:23.260]   and I understand that there are people
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:26.380]   like Witten, Maldacena, Nima, other people
[03:14:26.380 --> 03:14:28.220]   that can't understand it,
[03:14:28.220 --> 03:14:29.820]   and they're not trying to understand it.
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:31.100]   Sabina, she can understand it.
[03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:32.500]   She makes all these, you know,
[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:34.140]   oh, I don't understand it, I don't wanna understand it,
[03:14:34.140 --> 03:14:35.220]   I don't have time.
[03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:37.460]   And then she makes a video, a music video,
[03:14:37.460 --> 03:14:40.300]   you know, kinda mocking Eric and Steven and Garrett.
[03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:41.420]   I'm like, oh, you have a time to do,
[03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:42.380]   and I love Sabina,
[03:14:42.380 --> 03:14:44.460]   and I've actually promoted my show on her,
[03:14:44.460 --> 03:14:47.100]   and I love her, and she's doing a wonderful job,
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:49.860]   but you have a video that you said yourself
[03:14:49.860 --> 03:14:51.460]   takes eight weeks to produce from start to finish,
[03:14:51.460 --> 03:14:53.220]   and you couldn't have spent, you know,
[03:14:53.220 --> 03:14:54.540]   30 minutes, two hours.
[03:14:54.540 --> 03:14:55.900]   I, Brian Keating, have done it
[03:14:55.900 --> 03:14:57.780]   as an experimental cosmologist,
[03:14:57.780 --> 03:15:00.260]   and I have enough to say, like, this is interesting.
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:01.980]   It's part of the Assayer Project,
[03:15:01.980 --> 03:15:04.020]   and it actually, I shouldn't say that there are no people.
[03:15:04.020 --> 03:15:04.860]   There are very few.
[03:15:04.860 --> 03:15:08.140]   Louis Alvarez-Gomez at SUNY Stony Brook,
[03:15:08.140 --> 03:15:10.100]   the Simon Center for Geometrical Physics.
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:12.260]   So he and I are running this seminar,
[03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:13.100]   hopefully this summer.
[03:15:13.100 --> 03:15:14.420]   We're gonna reenact the famous
[03:15:14.420 --> 03:15:17.500]   Shelter Island Conferences of the 1900s,
[03:15:17.500 --> 03:15:19.180]   where, you know, Feynman got together,
[03:15:19.180 --> 03:15:21.020]   and they calculated the Lamb shift, and all that,
[03:15:21.020 --> 03:15:23.260]   but what did that feature?
[03:15:23.260 --> 03:15:25.660]   The harmony, the resonant minds
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:28.500]   behind the best experimentalists in cosmology,
[03:15:28.500 --> 03:15:30.540]   particle physics, condensed matter physics
[03:15:30.540 --> 03:15:31.940]   is now teaching us tremendous things
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:33.980]   about, you know, lower dimensional systems
[03:15:33.980 --> 03:15:34.940]   that can be applied.
[03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:37.780]   Theorists and experimentalists, observers,
[03:15:37.780 --> 03:15:40.620]   cosmologists, astronomers, we all get together,
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:43.340]   and we're just gonna do it out of a spirit of love.
[03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:46.060]   But if it's just like, oh, this guy's like a loudmouth,
[03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:46.900]   I don't have time for that.
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:47.740]   I really don't.
[03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:50.340]   I don't think it's an interesting way to spend my time.
[03:15:50.340 --> 03:15:52.940]   - There is a aspect that I hope to see,
[03:15:52.940 --> 03:15:56.460]   and it goes back to our sort of discussion
[03:15:56.460 --> 03:15:57.980]   about Joe Rogan.
[03:15:57.980 --> 03:16:00.460]   I do hope to see sort of love and humility
[03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:01.300]   in the presentation.
[03:16:01.300 --> 03:16:06.020]   Like, let go of this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen,
[03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:09.460]   and the ego that's inherent to the scientific pursuit,
[03:16:09.460 --> 03:16:14.460]   and now that everybody is established and known entities,
[03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:17.340]   let go of that a little bit,
[03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:20.140]   so we can explore and celebrate ideas.
[03:16:20.140 --> 03:16:21.340]   I would love to see more of that,
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:22.540]   just because you're saying,
[03:16:22.540 --> 03:16:26.140]   especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.
[03:16:26.140 --> 03:16:26.980]   - And I've talked, I mean,
[03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:28.540]   this isn't talking tails out of school,
[03:16:28.540 --> 03:16:30.060]   but I mean, he has made claims
[03:16:30.060 --> 03:16:31.820]   that I fundamentally disagree with,
[03:16:31.820 --> 03:16:33.540]   you know, in terms of like, you know,
[03:16:33.540 --> 03:16:35.820]   he's had this Twitter baiting, you know,
[03:16:35.820 --> 03:16:37.340]   loving trolling of Elon,
[03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:38.860]   why are you spending all this money to get to Mars?
[03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:39.980]   You know, we should be spending money
[03:16:39.980 --> 03:16:42.700]   on interdimensional travel, and we can unlock it.
[03:16:42.700 --> 03:16:44.540]   And I said to him, and he makes the point,
[03:16:44.540 --> 03:16:47.300]   you know, that, oh, the atomic theory,
[03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:49.500]   you know, that unleashed the nuclear age,
[03:16:49.500 --> 03:16:52.660]   and that, you know, could lead to planetary destruction.
[03:16:52.660 --> 03:16:56.100]   But I make the point, pushing back with love on him,
[03:16:56.100 --> 03:16:58.420]   and I say, look, nobody looked into the equations,
[03:16:58.420 --> 03:17:01.220]   you know, like, Fermi didn't look into all these equations
[03:17:01.220 --> 03:17:03.980]   of the unification, which still doesn't exist, by the way.
[03:17:03.980 --> 03:17:06.340]   We spend all this time, Lex, and I don't know why it is,
[03:17:06.340 --> 03:17:08.500]   it's a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics.
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:10.900]   People are looking for the toe,
[03:17:10.900 --> 03:17:12.900]   and they're overlooking the gut.
[03:17:12.900 --> 03:17:14.100]   In other words, they're spending all this time
[03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:16.020]   in a theory of everything, the God,
[03:17:16.020 --> 03:17:17.580]   and there's this gut that unifies
[03:17:17.580 --> 03:17:18.700]   the three stronger forces.
[03:17:18.700 --> 03:17:20.260]   We don't have a single theory for that.
[03:17:20.260 --> 03:17:22.940]   And people like Lashon, they've tried and failed at it.
[03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:23.900]   - Yeah, for people who don't know,
[03:17:23.900 --> 03:17:27.300]   there's four forces, gut, grant, unification theories
[03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:29.420]   that unifies the three forces, stuff,
[03:17:29.420 --> 03:17:30.860]   and Donald trying to get a shortcut
[03:17:30.860 --> 03:17:33.460]   to the theory of everything, which unifies the four.
[03:17:33.460 --> 03:17:35.780]   And then there's this whole thing
[03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:38.140]   that maybe quantum gravity's not even a thing.
[03:17:38.140 --> 03:17:43.140]   So we're trying to solve the puzzle of everything
[03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:51.500]   at the physics level, and then already before solving it,
[03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:53.220]   already saying, once we solve it,
[03:17:53.220 --> 03:17:55.020]   here's going to be all the beautiful--
[03:17:55.020 --> 03:17:56.740]   - Or just like, level jumping it,
[03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:59.060]   going to level 256.
[03:17:59.060 --> 03:18:00.820]   - Time-exiting thing.
[03:18:00.820 --> 03:18:03.940]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, I suppose you need
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:06.700]   that kind of ego, that confidence,
[03:18:06.700 --> 03:18:09.340]   that ambition in order to even have a chance
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:10.180]   at some of these--
[03:18:10.180 --> 03:18:13.100]   - The only two people in this book of nine Nobel laureates
[03:18:13.100 --> 03:18:16.100]   who told me they don't have the imposter syndrome
[03:18:16.100 --> 03:18:19.460]   were two theorists, Frank Wilczek and Sheldon Glashow.
[03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:21.020]   And Frank is a pretty interesting,
[03:18:21.020 --> 03:18:22.140]   and I know eventually we're gonna talk
[03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:25.260]   about the meaning of life, but you talk about Frank.
[03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:27.660]   Frank invented this theory along with his advisor
[03:18:27.660 --> 03:18:31.980]   and another, a third person in the early 1970s,
[03:18:31.980 --> 03:18:34.620]   which from 1974, three, when he was at Princeton,
[03:18:34.620 --> 03:18:36.980]   all the way up until 2004 when he won the Nobel Prize,
[03:18:36.980 --> 03:18:39.660]   every day of his life, imagine this, Lex,
[03:18:39.660 --> 03:18:41.060]   you're gonna have this startup,
[03:18:41.060 --> 03:18:43.220]   actually, someone tells you you're gonna win the lottery.
[03:18:43.220 --> 03:18:45.140]   You're gonna win the lottery in 40 years.
[03:18:45.140 --> 03:18:48.040]   What becomes your singular focus in your life
[03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.840]   from now until the next 40 years?
[03:18:49.840 --> 03:18:54.100]   - Well, I'm not sure.
[03:18:54.100 --> 03:18:56.380]   I mean, would it be winning the lottery?
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:57.220]   Or if I'm so confident--
[03:18:57.220 --> 03:18:59.140]   - You're guaranteed to win a lottery.
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:00.940]   There's this, here's this wallet, Bitcoin wallet,
[03:19:00.940 --> 03:19:02.260]   it's gonna guarantee to have as much money,
[03:19:02.260 --> 03:19:04.140]   it's a stable coin, whatever.
[03:19:04.140 --> 03:19:06.380]   You're gonna win it, but you have to wait 40 years.
[03:19:06.380 --> 03:19:09.140]   To me, it would be surviving for the next 40 years.
[03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:10.540]   You wouldn't leave your house.
[03:19:10.540 --> 03:19:12.500]   You would cover, go out in a bubble wrap hat.
[03:19:12.500 --> 03:19:14.660]   You wouldn't go out without 20 masks on, right?
[03:19:14.660 --> 03:19:17.140]   Your whole life would be consumed with,
[03:19:17.140 --> 03:19:18.380]   now imagine everyone's telling you
[03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:19.420]   you're gonna win the Nobel Prize,
[03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:20.800]   which is bigger than the lottery.
[03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:23.220]   I mean, many prizes are worth more than the Nobel Prize,
[03:19:23.220 --> 03:19:25.100]   and every person who wins a prize
[03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:27.300]   that's worth three times the money, like Maldecena,
[03:19:27.300 --> 03:19:29.280]   he would trade that breakthrough prize
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:30.700]   for a Nobel Prize in a heartbeat.
[03:19:30.700 --> 03:19:33.820]   So these guys had to wait 40 years.
[03:19:33.820 --> 03:19:35.540]   Imagine the excruciating pain.
[03:19:35.540 --> 03:19:36.540]   What got him through it?
[03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:38.460]   He didn't feel like he didn't deserve it.
[03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:40.540]   He felt like, hell yeah, I earned it.
[03:19:40.540 --> 03:19:42.420]   He has that swagger.
[03:19:42.420 --> 03:19:44.340]   And what I'm looking for in this asset
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:47.520]   is to try to find ways that we can test stuff now,
[03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:49.300]   'cause I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 40 years,
[03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:51.820]   I hope I am, but can we bypass, can we get shortcuts
[03:19:51.820 --> 03:19:53.660]   to what's called the low energy regime?
[03:19:53.660 --> 03:19:55.620]   And to me, that's what's interesting.
[03:19:55.620 --> 03:19:56.700]   Like, what can we do now?
[03:19:56.700 --> 03:19:59.620]   I don't care, like Isaac Newton came up with color theory,
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:00.620]   and he did something really interesting.
[03:20:00.620 --> 03:20:02.100]   Next time I come, I'll bring you some prisms.
[03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:03.100]   So what did he do?
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:05.140]   He took a white light, he took a prism,
[03:20:05.140 --> 03:20:06.780]   from the sun, actually, he put it through a slit,
[03:20:06.780 --> 03:20:09.540]   put it through a prism, and it made a beautiful rainbow,
[03:20:09.540 --> 03:20:10.500]   like you've seen.
[03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:13.740]   And then he took another prism, and he put it upside down,
[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:15.580]   like, you know, dark side of the moon, whatever,
[03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:17.260]   and the light went through the first prism,
[03:20:17.260 --> 03:20:18.980]   turned into a rainbow, and then the rainbow
[03:20:18.980 --> 03:20:21.500]   went into a prism and came out a white light.
[03:20:21.500 --> 03:20:22.780]   That's pretty cool.
[03:20:22.780 --> 03:20:24.780]   Then he took a popsicle stick or whatever,
[03:20:24.780 --> 03:20:26.420]   it's probably, you know, pipe tobacco,
[03:20:26.420 --> 03:20:29.700]   and he put it in the beam, like, blocked out the orange,
[03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:31.740]   and it didn't make white light come out.
[03:20:31.740 --> 03:20:34.100]   So he showed, like, colors of synthesis.
[03:20:34.100 --> 03:20:34.940]   It's a combination.
[03:20:34.940 --> 03:20:38.100]   He didn't use, like, the Large Hadron Collider to do that.
[03:20:38.100 --> 03:20:40.180]   You know, he used a very low-energy experiment
[03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:42.460]   to prove a unification in this color physics,
[03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:43.700]   and different kind of color physics
[03:20:43.700 --> 03:20:45.380]   than in quantum chromodynamics.
[03:20:45.380 --> 03:20:47.820]   But nevertheless, can we find things like that?
[03:20:47.820 --> 03:20:49.780]   Are we spending way too much time and energy
[03:20:49.780 --> 03:20:52.180]   thinking about the future circular collider,
[03:20:52.180 --> 03:20:53.180]   which, even if it gets built,
[03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:55.260]   will cost $30 billion just to build?
[03:20:55.260 --> 03:20:56.700]   By the way, anytime, from now on,
[03:20:56.700 --> 03:20:57.940]   if I leave you with anything,
[03:20:57.940 --> 03:21:00.140]   anytime an experimental physicist tells you a number,
[03:21:00.140 --> 03:21:01.980]   always double it, maybe triple it.
[03:21:01.980 --> 03:21:03.220]   - How much is it gonna cost?
[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:04.100]   - To operate it.
[03:21:04.100 --> 03:21:06.220]   So, like, do we build an aircraft carrier
[03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:07.700]   to build an aircraft carrier?
[03:21:07.700 --> 03:21:10.420]   Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor facility?
[03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:12.020]   And the rule of thumb that works pretty well
[03:21:12.020 --> 03:21:14.860]   in project management is it costs about 10% per year
[03:21:14.860 --> 03:21:18.140]   to operate a given object of sufficient complexity.
[03:21:18.140 --> 03:21:19.700]   And in this case, so, in 10 years,
[03:21:19.700 --> 03:21:20.820]   it'll cost double the cost.
[03:21:20.820 --> 03:21:22.400]   So never believe a number,
[03:21:22.400 --> 03:21:24.780]   whether it's from our mutual friend Harry or whoever,
[03:21:24.780 --> 03:21:26.140]   don't believe the number, double it,
[03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:27.500]   and then say, is it worth it?
[03:21:27.660 --> 03:21:30.420]   And so, building a solar system-sized accelerator,
[03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:32.740]   even if it were possible, do we have to do that?
[03:21:32.740 --> 03:21:35.780]   Or can we use these two 30 solar mass objects
[03:21:35.780 --> 03:21:38.620]   colliding together to test the number
[03:21:38.620 --> 03:21:40.340]   of large extraspatial dimensions?
[03:21:40.340 --> 03:21:41.180]   Can we do that?
[03:21:41.180 --> 03:21:42.000]   People are working on it.
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:43.100]   I think it's fascinating.
[03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:46.140]   - So, focus on building detectors.
[03:21:46.140 --> 03:21:46.980]   - Experiments.
[03:21:46.980 --> 03:21:53.260]   - That, like, where the cosmos
[03:21:53.260 --> 03:21:56.020]   is part of the experiment, I suppose.
[03:21:56.020 --> 03:21:57.340]   That's doing the hard work.
[03:21:57.340 --> 03:22:00.260]   'Cause when you're saying low energy regime,
[03:22:00.260 --> 03:22:02.620]   'cause for some of these, especially big questions
[03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:03.820]   like theories of everything,
[03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:07.380]   you need some high energy events.
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:10.260]   And so, somehow figure out how the high energy events
[03:22:10.260 --> 03:22:12.660]   that are already happening out there,
[03:22:12.660 --> 03:22:16.140]   how to leverage them here on Earth.
[03:22:16.140 --> 03:22:19.140]   - So, one of the alternative theories of cosmology
[03:22:19.140 --> 03:22:22.100]   that is not singular quantum gravitational requiring,
[03:22:22.100 --> 03:22:23.940]   as the Big Bang and inflation are,
[03:22:23.940 --> 03:22:26.100]   is, are these balancing models.
[03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:29.100]   Some of them feature a similar kind of entity
[03:22:29.100 --> 03:22:30.660]   called a quantum field.
[03:22:30.660 --> 03:22:33.380]   And that quantum field in the initial stages
[03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:35.460]   of the universe of our current, after the bounce,
[03:22:35.460 --> 03:22:36.700]   which is not a singularity,
[03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:39.340]   it compresses to a classical kind of rebound,
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:41.560]   and the universe starts expanding.
[03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:44.740]   During that process, the expansion is governed
[03:22:44.740 --> 03:22:46.420]   by what's called a scalar field,
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:48.300]   of which we only know one that exists,
[03:22:48.300 --> 03:22:49.260]   that's called the Higgs boson.
[03:22:49.260 --> 03:22:51.700]   Higgs is a scalar fundamental particle,
[03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:53.500]   a fundamental field.
[03:22:53.500 --> 03:22:56.340]   That field then later does double duty,
[03:22:56.340 --> 03:22:59.540]   and it becomes dark energy.
[03:22:59.540 --> 03:23:01.020]   So, it solves two problems.
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:02.740]   And I'm not saying it's correct, we don't know yet.
[03:23:02.740 --> 03:23:04.620]   But are there observations of,
[03:23:04.620 --> 03:23:06.320]   and so dark energy is manifest today,
[03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:10.220]   it's manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions,
[03:23:10.220 --> 03:23:11.220]   et cetera, et cetera.
[03:23:11.220 --> 03:23:13.220]   We see the effects of accelerating universe
[03:23:13.220 --> 03:23:15.100]   caused by presumably dark energy.
[03:23:15.100 --> 03:23:18.260]   Is dark energy a constant, or does it vary?
[03:23:18.260 --> 03:23:20.780]   That has to vary in order for this theory to be true,
[03:23:20.780 --> 03:23:22.380]   because that eventually has to decay
[03:23:22.380 --> 03:23:24.380]   so that the universe can not support itself
[03:23:24.380 --> 03:23:26.660]   and collapse again, again classically.
[03:23:26.660 --> 03:23:28.580]   So, we could use low energy phenomena,
[03:23:28.580 --> 03:23:29.820]   it's hard to think of supernova
[03:23:29.820 --> 03:23:31.460]   as being a low energy phenomenon,
[03:23:31.460 --> 03:23:34.160]   but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field,
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:36.580]   and see, does it change, or is it a constant?
[03:23:36.580 --> 03:23:38.140]   That's an example of a low energy limit
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:40.180]   to prove a high energy phenomenon,
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:42.980]   like this collapsing universe in the cyclic model.
[03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:45.000]   - Speaking of things that cost a lot,
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.480]   but are super exciting.
[03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:49.980]   - Page two.
[03:23:51.300 --> 03:23:52.900]   - No, we'll wrap it up.
[03:23:52.900 --> 03:23:53.740]   - No.
[03:23:53.740 --> 03:23:56.500]   - There's more than page two.
[03:23:56.500 --> 03:23:58.540]   What do you think this is?
[03:23:58.540 --> 03:23:59.380]   This is--
[03:23:59.380 --> 03:24:00.200]   - A thesis.
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:01.040]   (Lex laughing)
[03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:02.220]   Actually, well, Louis de Broglie's thesis
[03:24:02.220 --> 03:24:03.060]   was three pages long,
[03:24:03.060 --> 03:24:06.020]   and he won the Nobel Prize for the wave-particle duality.
[03:24:06.020 --> 03:24:10.740]   - So, size matters in different dimensions in life.
[03:24:10.740 --> 03:24:13.460]   I think the lessons I've learned about life
[03:24:13.460 --> 03:24:16.880]   is the shorter the paper, or the shorter the thesis.
[03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:18.940]   Actually, the shorter the paper,
[03:24:18.940 --> 03:24:21.700]   some of the greatest papers ever written are short.
[03:24:21.700 --> 03:24:25.980]   I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,
[03:24:25.980 --> 03:24:28.420]   not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman,
[03:24:28.420 --> 03:24:30.420]   a contradiction on top of a contradiction,
[03:24:30.420 --> 03:24:32.700]   but it could be written on a napkin, honestly.
[03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:37.160]   Which just kind of tells you something about ideas.
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:44.500]   What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope?
[03:24:45.540 --> 03:24:49.940]   Is this, as somebody who likes telescopes,
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:52.720]   and this is one of the, I think it says,
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:56.780]   took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion.
[03:24:56.780 --> 03:24:59.340]   Is that way too much, too little?
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:01.340]   Are you excited about this thing?
[03:25:01.340 --> 03:25:04.180]   - It's sufficiently different from what I do in my field
[03:25:04.180 --> 03:25:06.000]   that it's incredibly interesting to me,
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:09.700]   'cause I have no horse in that race,
[03:25:09.700 --> 03:25:11.860]   and so I'm not competing with them for time,
[03:25:11.860 --> 03:25:14.420]   or money, or resources, or people, or whatever.
[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:18.980]   So I can purely be an advocate and an aficionado of science.
[03:25:18.980 --> 03:25:21.900]   It is, in some sense, the successor to Hubble.
[03:25:21.900 --> 03:25:24.680]   It will do things that Hubble can't do.
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:27.700]   It will also, may or may not have the impact
[03:25:27.700 --> 03:25:31.540]   on a visceral, kind of artistic level that Hubble had.
[03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:34.300]   What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?
[03:25:34.300 --> 03:25:37.820]   The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the Pillars of Creation,
[03:25:37.820 --> 03:25:42.820]   storms and imaging of these twisted deep sky galaxies.
[03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:44.980]   Those resonated with the public.
[03:25:44.980 --> 03:25:46.460]   - Just visually, they were beautiful.
[03:25:46.460 --> 03:25:48.980]   - Visually, yeah, when you look at these images,
[03:25:48.980 --> 03:25:51.540]   the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, you'll maybe put that in,
[03:25:51.540 --> 03:25:54.020]   you'll show every speck of light except for one.
[03:25:54.020 --> 03:25:57.740]   4,000 blobs of light, there's one star in our galaxy,
[03:25:57.740 --> 03:25:58.980]   the rest are galaxies.
[03:25:58.980 --> 03:26:02.220]   Now, that image is less than 1/10 of your fingernail
[03:26:02.220 --> 03:26:05.780]   held out at arm's length, it contains 4,000 galaxies.
[03:26:05.780 --> 03:26:08.480]   So now you can figure out how many galaxies there are
[03:26:08.480 --> 03:26:11.340]   in the whole sky just by seeing how long does it take you
[03:26:11.340 --> 03:26:13.140]   to move your fingernail over the whole sky?
[03:26:13.140 --> 03:26:15.180]   So we have another couple hours.
[03:26:15.180 --> 03:26:16.280]   But no, so it comes out to be,
[03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:18.900]   that's how we get 500 billion or more galaxies.
[03:26:18.900 --> 03:26:20.340]   Now, it's not exact to the galaxy,
[03:26:20.340 --> 03:26:22.820]   but it's a good order of magnitude estimate,
[03:26:22.820 --> 03:26:24.480]   maybe even better.
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:26.900]   Hubble produced that, and it was basically serendipitous.
[03:26:26.900 --> 03:26:29.140]   They pointed to some dark, blank piece of sky,
[03:26:29.140 --> 03:26:30.780]   what they thought was blank, and they saw it.
[03:26:30.780 --> 03:26:32.540]   Same thing that happened with the CMB.
[03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:34.420]   They were looking for something they didn't find.
[03:26:34.420 --> 03:26:35.820]   Same thing they found when they were looking
[03:26:35.820 --> 03:26:38.260]   for the deceleration of the universe
[03:26:38.260 --> 03:26:40.260]   and found it was accelerating.
[03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:43.100]   So what I sometimes hear is that we don't know
[03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:44.380]   what we're gonna discover.
[03:26:44.380 --> 03:26:45.980]   I never think that's a good idea
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:48.060]   to spend billions of dollars on something.
[03:26:48.060 --> 03:26:51.100]   You should have some guaranteed low-hanging fruit,
[03:26:51.100 --> 03:26:53.300]   and then there should be swinging for the fences.
[03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.620]   And I think in this case, it was really everything
[03:26:55.620 --> 03:26:57.060]   is swinging for the fences 'cause it's either,
[03:26:57.060 --> 03:26:58.500]   it's kind of a single-point failure.
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:27:01.800]   If that telescope, which is this origami construction
[03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:05.380]   of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly
[03:27:05.380 --> 03:27:08.160]   and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth,
[03:27:08.160 --> 03:27:10.960]   beyond the Earth-Moon distance by a factor of four,
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:15.240]   and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth,
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:17.620]   get solar energy, keep it away from the sun.
[03:27:17.620 --> 03:27:19.620]   You don't wanna look through the telescope of the sun
[03:27:19.620 --> 03:27:20.940]   with your remaining good eye.
[03:27:20.940 --> 03:27:23.980]   And you do that, and you cover, it's gonna be phenomenal
[03:27:23.980 --> 03:27:27.940]   for science, for sure, if it works.
[03:27:27.940 --> 03:27:30.540]   There are a lot of people think, it's so risky,
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:33.580]   NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up,
[03:27:33.580 --> 03:27:34.660]   and what if it does fail?
[03:27:34.660 --> 03:27:35.920]   I mean, there's no guarantee.
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:37.700]   Yes, it's insured, but so what?
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:39.980]   You're not gonna get back those 20 years of people,
[03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:41.380]   well, let's start building it again.
[03:27:41.380 --> 03:27:43.420]   They didn't build two copies of it.
[03:27:43.420 --> 03:27:48.420]   - And then if it fails, it kinda has a dampening effect
[03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:51.980]   on the prospects and the inspiration of the public
[03:27:51.980 --> 03:27:54.500]   for what science can do, what science engineering can do
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:55.980]   is out in space.
[03:27:55.980 --> 03:27:57.620]   - It will make a huge impact scientifically.
[03:27:57.620 --> 03:28:00.060]   Let's hope for the best, let's assume it does succeed.
[03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:01.620]   It's launched in a couple weeks.
[03:28:01.620 --> 03:28:06.140]   And when it does, it will transform our understanding of,
[03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:10.040]   we just discovered not only extrasolar planets
[03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:12.060]   that have moons on them and asteroid belt,
[03:28:12.060 --> 03:28:15.060]   we discovered an extrasolar planet in another galaxy.
[03:28:15.060 --> 03:28:16.940]   This'll be able to see crazy stuff like that,
[03:28:16.940 --> 03:28:21.740]   spectroscopy, imaging, but it'll be able to go back
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:25.020]   farther in time such that we will be doing,
[03:28:25.020 --> 03:28:27.460]   Hubble did some cosmology, it measured the Hubble constant,
[03:28:27.460 --> 03:28:30.900]   that was its key project when it was designed and launched.
[03:28:30.900 --> 03:28:33.460]   But because it is an optical telescope,
[03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:35.660]   it's sensitive to more close-in redshifts,
[03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:37.100]   so shorter distances.
[03:28:37.100 --> 03:28:39.340]   Now, James Webb is much, much higher redshift,
[03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:42.260]   it can probe the darker, deeper, distant universe.
[03:28:42.260 --> 03:28:44.440]   - Okay, let's talk about not the distant universe,
[03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:47.100]   but our neighboring planets.
[03:28:47.100 --> 03:28:49.460]   First, I gotta ask you about the moon.
[03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:55.140]   So there's a piece of the moon on this table
[03:28:55.140 --> 03:28:58.660]   that you've given me that we didn't have to pick up
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:00.220]   that arrived here.
[03:29:00.220 --> 03:29:01.060]   - That's right.
[03:29:01.060 --> 03:29:03.360]   - So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on Earth?
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:06.660]   - So this chunk of the moon, if it were delivered
[03:29:06.660 --> 03:29:10.300]   by the Apollo and NASA missions,
[03:29:10.300 --> 03:29:12.820]   you and I would be guilty of a felony right now,
[03:29:12.820 --> 03:29:14.580]   'cause it's illegal to own pieces of the moon
[03:29:14.580 --> 03:29:16.500]   collected by the Apollo astronauts.
[03:29:16.500 --> 03:29:19.640]   So don't even joke about that when you go over to Houston.
[03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:21.340]   This piece of moon rock was delivered
[03:29:21.340 --> 03:29:23.540]   via the old-fashioned way, by gravity.
[03:29:23.540 --> 03:29:27.620]   So this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off
[03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:31.820]   because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids.
[03:29:31.820 --> 03:29:34.760]   Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon
[03:29:34.760 --> 03:29:37.580]   into space, and it will then orbit
[03:29:37.580 --> 03:29:41.100]   the common moon-Earth system,
[03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:44.260]   and it will then eventually enter our atmosphere.
[03:29:44.260 --> 03:29:46.660]   If the piece is large enough and the trajectory is proper,
[03:29:46.660 --> 03:29:48.640]   it can land intact, and this one landed
[03:29:48.640 --> 03:29:52.420]   with a few hundred grams worth, and they sliced it up,
[03:29:52.420 --> 03:29:56.340]   and then it was delivered via US Postal Service to my house.
[03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:57.500]   So you can buy these pieces,
[03:29:57.500 --> 03:29:59.660]   and actually, you can buy a piece of Mars.
[03:29:59.660 --> 03:30:02.660]   You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route.
[03:30:02.660 --> 03:30:04.240]   Now, what's so interesting about that?
[03:30:04.240 --> 03:30:06.540]   Well, if a piece of Mars can get here,
[03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:08.580]   a piece of Earth can get there.
[03:30:08.580 --> 03:30:11.420]   Some piece of Earth has some life forms on it.
[03:30:11.420 --> 03:30:13.740]   It could get there, and if that can happen
[03:30:13.740 --> 03:30:16.420]   in our solar system, it could happen throughout the galaxy.
[03:30:16.420 --> 03:30:18.420]   So I'm actually not of the opinion
[03:30:18.420 --> 03:30:21.360]   that there is life elsewhere in the universe,
[03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:23.540]   at least technological life, that we can,
[03:30:23.540 --> 03:30:25.980]   I see this look of horror on your face.
[03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:30.140]   I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,
[03:30:30.140 --> 03:30:31.380]   would be extremely surprised.
[03:30:31.380 --> 03:30:34.500]   - I'm just, I'm curious by the transition,
[03:30:34.500 --> 03:30:38.380]   because you just said that life could have arrived
[03:30:38.380 --> 03:30:40.660]   from Mars, or like from planet to planet,
[03:30:40.660 --> 03:30:43.420]   but because of the meteorite striking it and so on,
[03:30:43.420 --> 03:30:45.700]   and then you went to, you don't think
[03:30:45.700 --> 03:30:48.740]   there might be life out there in the universe.
[03:30:48.740 --> 03:30:49.780]   - Technological life.
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:52.140]   - Technological life, yeah,
[03:30:52.140 --> 03:30:54.180]   advanced intelligent civilizations, okay.
[03:30:55.500 --> 03:30:57.100]   - Okay, so go on.
[03:30:57.100 --> 03:30:58.540]   - So that's the generalization
[03:30:58.540 --> 03:31:01.100]   of what the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,
[03:31:01.100 --> 03:31:04.740]   I know this is a PG-13, it's called panspermia.
[03:31:04.740 --> 03:31:06.480]   Panspermia.
[03:31:06.480 --> 03:31:07.320]   - Beep that out, please.
[03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:08.140]   - Yeah, yeah, please.
[03:31:08.140 --> 03:31:12.520]   And that's the exchange of genetic life form material
[03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:14.380]   from other reaches on Earth,
[03:31:14.380 --> 03:31:16.860]   which explains the origin of life on Earth,
[03:31:16.860 --> 03:31:18.420]   but not the origin of life itself,
[03:31:18.420 --> 03:31:20.220]   which I think is a much grander mystery
[03:31:20.220 --> 03:31:22.140]   and much more interesting.
[03:31:22.140 --> 03:31:23.180]   How did life get here?
[03:31:23.180 --> 03:31:25.740]   And you've talked with many eminent people about that.
[03:31:25.740 --> 03:31:26.860]   I'm not gonna add that much,
[03:31:26.860 --> 03:31:29.540]   but just thinking about the reverse process.
[03:31:29.540 --> 03:31:32.460]   Let's say life started on the Earth somehow,
[03:31:32.460 --> 03:31:34.700]   and then made its way out into the universe.
[03:31:34.700 --> 03:31:37.000]   Is there enough time for whatever material
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:40.540]   went from Earth via panspermic direction,
[03:31:40.540 --> 03:31:42.880]   spraying the love gun out into the universe,
[03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:45.180]   did that then have enough time to incubate
[03:31:45.180 --> 03:31:47.440]   and go onto a planet that could support it?
[03:31:47.440 --> 03:31:49.660]   Certainly not within our solar system,
[03:31:49.660 --> 03:31:51.400]   which traveling at the meteorite speeds
[03:31:51.400 --> 03:31:53.900]   would require hundreds of millions of years.
[03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:55.720]   Then looking at the evolutionary history
[03:31:55.720 --> 03:32:00.660]   from bacteria to Bach, from rocks to Rachmaninoff,
[03:32:00.660 --> 03:32:01.880]   I don't know, I can do this all day.
[03:32:01.880 --> 03:32:02.880]   - Oh wow, that's pretty good.
[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:05.080]   - How do you get from those very simple,
[03:32:05.080 --> 03:32:06.320]   inanimate objects to life?
[03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:07.800]   I just simply think there's not enough time
[03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:10.000]   for Earth to seed life, technological life
[03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:10.840]   throughout the galaxy.
[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:13.160]   I don't think there's any evidence for that.
[03:32:13.160 --> 03:32:18.120]   - So you really think that the origin of life on Earth
[03:32:18.120 --> 03:32:19.960]   is a really special event?
[03:32:19.960 --> 03:32:22.720]   - Yeah, if it did originate on Earth.
[03:32:22.720 --> 03:32:24.760]   My question for those that search for life
[03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:28.400]   outside the Earth is what if you had a letter from God
[03:32:28.400 --> 03:32:32.800]   and the letter said life didn't originate on Earth?
[03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:35.280]   Would you choose a different profession?
[03:32:35.280 --> 03:32:36.600]   It would seem hopeless.
[03:32:36.600 --> 03:32:38.240]   In other words, we only have a sample of one.
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:40.280]   In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,
[03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:42.760]   let alone one planet that has life on it.
[03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:45.040]   What if you knew for sure it didn't start here?
[03:32:45.040 --> 03:32:48.040]   That means that there's almost nothing about Earth
[03:32:48.040 --> 03:32:52.200]   that is originated, it didn't originate the life process.
[03:32:52.200 --> 03:32:53.960]   So to study purely the origin of life,
[03:32:53.960 --> 03:32:55.920]   not life itself, I think that's still fascinating.
[03:32:55.920 --> 03:32:59.200]   But how could we learn about the origin of,
[03:32:59.200 --> 03:33:01.080]   remember, you have to go from inanimate object
[03:33:01.080 --> 03:33:04.240]   to a living object, whatever that definition of life is.
[03:33:04.240 --> 03:33:06.320]   And I'm not an expert in many definitions,
[03:33:06.320 --> 03:33:09.440]   Max, Sarah, many different definitions.
[03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:13.720]   But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate?
[03:33:13.720 --> 03:33:14.760]   It's a huge question.
[03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:17.300]   - Yeah, but then you don't have to be the place
[03:33:17.300 --> 03:33:20.480]   where life originated to replicate the origin.
[03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:23.480]   Yeah, that's one way to understand something
[03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:26.040]   is to build it.
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:27.720]   But another way is to just observe it.
[03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:31.480]   You don't have to truly re-engineer from scratch.
[03:33:31.480 --> 03:33:37.240]   But then, yes, if it didn't originate on Earth,
[03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:41.800]   then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites
[03:33:41.800 --> 03:33:43.640]   of life are off.
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:45.280]   - What's the governing principle?
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:50.360]   - And then you could have just almost an arbitrary number
[03:33:50.360 --> 03:33:54.500]   of possible, like if life didn't start on Earth.
[03:33:54.500 --> 03:33:59.080]   To me, that's exciting because it's like,
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:01.200]   we know even less than we thought.
[03:34:01.200 --> 03:34:05.220]   The thing is, it can prosper on Earth, though.
[03:34:05.220 --> 03:34:06.060]   - Yeah.
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:08.940]   - So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different
[03:34:08.940 --> 03:34:11.220]   from the maintenance of life.
[03:34:11.220 --> 03:34:13.220]   - Right, and maybe the existence
[03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:16.680]   of the Earth-life symbiosis is critical.
[03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:18.940]   I think Sarah, you talked about Sarah Walker,
[03:34:18.940 --> 03:34:22.120]   that it's a planetary phenomenon, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:34:22.120 --> 03:34:24.680]   So doesn't that make it less like, in other words,
[03:34:24.680 --> 03:34:27.120]   not only do you need special life conditions
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:31.580]   to create life, but then sustenance of life, as you say,
[03:34:31.580 --> 03:34:33.860]   that also has to be maintained
[03:34:33.860 --> 03:34:37.020]   under very specific circumstances by very specific planets
[03:34:37.020 --> 03:34:39.540]   and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.
[03:34:39.540 --> 03:34:41.520]   And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby.
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:43.780]   You need an Earth and a moon system
[03:34:43.780 --> 03:34:46.000]   so that you don't get bombarded too early.
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:48.760]   And I always think this, technological life,
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:50.640]   I haven't said this before, really, so I'm just speaking,
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:52.800]   I usually like to write down before I say a different thing.
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:53.840]   But one of the things I thought about--
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:34:55.280]   - Somebody host a podcast.
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:56.120]   (Lex laughing)
[03:34:56.120 --> 03:34:57.660]   You should probably accept the fact
[03:34:57.660 --> 03:35:00.160]   that you're going to say stupid things every once in a while.
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:02.840]   - Not every once in a while, every while.
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:07.580]   I claim that to get to sending people to the moon,
[03:35:07.580 --> 03:35:12.200]   our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right?
[03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:14.960]   You don't make a solar panel from another solar panel.
[03:35:14.960 --> 03:35:17.080]   You made a solar panel from a factory
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:20.160]   that melted down glass, silica, aluminum,
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:21.700]   extruded that using fossil fuels.
[03:35:21.700 --> 03:35:23.360]   Where do those fossil fuels come from?
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:26.400]   Like, so any civilization that's gonna be a Dyson,
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:29.560]   Kardashev's, did they have dinosaurs?
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:31.260]   Did they have prebiotic life?
[03:35:31.260 --> 03:35:32.880]   Did they have a great oxygenation event?
[03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:37.360]   Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic, eukaryotic?
[03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:39.120]   All those hurdles, let's say you give each one,
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:40.880]   let's say there's eight hurdles,
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:42.480]   and each one of those has a probability
[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:44.600]   of one in a thousand to go from,
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:46.720]   eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever.
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:48.080]   Let's say there's a one in a thousand chance.
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:50.440]   I think it's like one in 10 to the 40th or whatever,
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:52.520]   if you really do it, but let's say it's first generous
[03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:55.040]   nature, one in 10 to the three.
[03:35:55.040 --> 03:35:57.040]   Let's say there's eight of those hurdles.
[03:35:57.040 --> 03:36:01.080]   That means you have 10 to the 24th power,
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:04.500]   different possibility, and that's just with eight.
[03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:05.720]   Like the moon has to be there,
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:07.840]   Jupiter has to be there, dinosaurs have to be there,
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:08.880]   all the different things that we have
[03:36:08.880 --> 03:36:11.000]   to get to technological life.
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:12.760]   There's only 10 to the, only,
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:15.200]   there's 10 to the 22nd, we think,
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:18.880]   Earth, not Earth, planets in the observable universe,
[03:36:18.880 --> 03:36:20.400]   not the galaxy.
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:23.760]   So that's 100 times fewer than the probability
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:27.360]   to get 100% clearing these eight very low hurdles
[03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:28.800]   of one in a thousand.
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:30.720]   - That's fascinating, 'cause now I really need
[03:36:30.720 --> 03:36:32.880]   to listen to your conversation with Lee Cronin,
[03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:36.440]   who I believe you had, because he believes the opposite.
[03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:37.560]   - Yes, I know.
[03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:39.720]   Yeah, I wanna have a debate with him.
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:44.720]   He believes that the way biology evolved on Earth
[03:36:44.720 --> 03:36:48.920]   could have evolved almost an infinite number of other ways.
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:51.200]   So like if you ran Earth over and over and over,
[03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:54.320]   you would keep getting life, and it would be very different.
[03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:59.320]   So the fact that our particular life seems unique
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:02.320]   is just like, well, 'cause every freaking life
[03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:05.080]   is gonna seem unique, but it'll be very different.
[03:37:05.080 --> 03:37:07.680]   It's not like, we shouldn't be asking the question
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:11.240]   of what's the likelihood of getting a human-like thing,
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:15.320]   because that seems to be super special.
[03:37:15.320 --> 03:37:18.520]   It's more like, (laughs)
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:21.520]   how easy is it to make-- - Slime mold.
[03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:23.960]   - Anything that has the skills of a human,
[03:37:23.960 --> 03:37:26.040]   and I don't mean like something with thumbs,
[03:37:26.040 --> 03:37:29.600]   but achieving basically a technological civilization.
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:33.840]   And according to Lee, at least, it's trivial.
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.560]   - I know, we fought, I fought a little bit.
[03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:37.000]   I'd love to debate him, I think it'd be a lot of fun,
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:38.040]   'cause we debate with love.
[03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:39.120]   When I talk with Lee, I love him,
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:40.920]   and he loves me, I think, I hope.
[03:37:40.920 --> 03:37:42.480]   But let me ask you a question.
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:45.960]   I asked this of him and Sarah on our Clubhouse once.
[03:37:45.960 --> 03:37:47.880]   So what do you think would happen the next day?
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:52.320]   Let's say we discover life, it's Proxima Centauri B.
[03:37:52.320 --> 03:37:54.960]   It looks just like slime mold,
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:37:57.840]   like you got on your brie cheese or whatever.
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:37:58.960]   We discover it.
[03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:00.520]   What would happen the next day?
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:04.000]   And they were like, "Oh, this would be transformative."
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.960]   And I'm not trying to be like total Cassandra about this,
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:09.800]   but I said, "I don't think anything would happen."
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:10.640]   And they're like, "What are you talking about?
[03:38:10.640 --> 03:38:12.160]   "It would be transformational."
[03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:14.160]   I'm like, "I stipulate that life exists.
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:16.680]   "Go down to the river, I'm in San Diego,
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:19.240]   "go down to the Pacific Ocean, scoop up a glass.
[03:38:19.240 --> 03:38:22.680]   "You're gonna find life in there."
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:23.640]   And what are we doing?
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:25.400]   What are we doing to our Earth?
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:27.320]   We're destroying it callously.
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:29.280]   We're pumping crap into there.
[03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:31.160]   We have this toxic waste spill a couple months ago
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:33.640]   in San Diego, I couldn't go to the beach.
[03:38:33.640 --> 03:38:35.240]   Let me take it a step further.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:38.080]   You know how many people, I'm sorry that you do know,
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:41.520]   but how many people died in the 20th century, killed?
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:44.160]   These are advanced civilization, this isn't a slime mold.
[03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:48.280]   We kill, we maim, we harm, we hurt, we hate.
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:50.200]   I don't think anything would happen the next day.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:51.040]   Then we go back to what we had.
[03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:52.880]   And I said, "If that weren't proof enough,
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:55.220]   "life has been discovered at least two or three times
[03:38:55.220 --> 03:38:56.480]   "just in my professional career.
[03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:00.340]   "Once in 1996, these Allen Land Hills meteorites
[03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:04.340]   "in Antarctica, microbial respiration processes.
[03:39:04.340 --> 03:39:05.360]   "Still, we don't know."
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:07.240]   It was a press conference held by Bill Clinton
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:09.040]   on the White House lawn that's featured in the movie,
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:12.060]   "Contact," repurpose for that movie.
[03:39:12.060 --> 03:39:17.240]   And then there's this phosphorus life,
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:20.960]   this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake.
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:24.320]   Many, you know, extremophile, we don't give a crap.
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:25.480]   We continue to treat.
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:27.760]   So why are we thinking that like our salvation,
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:30.680]   from whence will our salvation come, as the Bible says?
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:32.640]   Like, it's not gonna change how we are.
[03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:36.240]   It's not gonna magnify how I treat you or you treat me.
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:38.400]   And we're pretty knowledgeable people, you and I,
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:39.880]   compared to, you know, lay people.
[03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:40.720]   - Okay, that's interesting.
[03:39:40.720 --> 03:39:41.940]   That's a really interesting argument.
[03:39:41.940 --> 03:39:45.840]   I wonder if you're right, but my intuition is,
[03:39:45.840 --> 03:39:50.360]   I can maybe present a different argument
[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:52.620]   that you can think about in the realm of things
[03:39:52.620 --> 03:39:55.800]   you care about even deeper, which is like,
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:58.820]   what happens once we figure out the origins of the universe?
[03:39:58.820 --> 03:40:00.000]   Like, how would that change your life?
[03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:03.440]   - I would say there are certain discoveries
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:05.020]   that even in their very idea
[03:40:05.020 --> 03:40:07.280]   will change the fabric of society.
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:10.200]   I tend to see if there's definitive proof
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:12.200]   that there's life, and the more complex,
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:16.760]   the more powerful that idea is elsewhere,
[03:40:16.760 --> 03:40:20.540]   that I'm not exactly sure how it will change society,
[03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:24.600]   because it's such a slap in the face.
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:28.040]   It's such a humbling force, or maybe not.
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:30.140]   Or maybe it's a motivator to say,
[03:40:30.140 --> 03:40:33.040]   yeah, I don't know which force would take over.
[03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:36.160]   Maybe it would be governments with military
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:38.980]   start to think like, well, how do we kill it?
[03:40:38.980 --> 03:40:41.520]   If there's a lot of life out there,
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:43.040]   how do we create the defenses?
[03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:44.080]   - How do we extract it?
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:47.920]   - Or yeah, or mine it for benefits.
[03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:48.840]   - I mean, I just see like,
[03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:51.720]   there's a hundred million literal counter examples of that.
[03:40:51.720 --> 03:40:56.560]   I mean, right now there's like 700 million kids in poverty,
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:58.880]   and how do we go about our life
[03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:00.080]   and just not deal with that?
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:01.720]   I mean, look, I put it aside.
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:04.100]   I eat hamburgers, and in a hundred years,
[03:41:04.100 --> 03:41:07.380]   I'll be canceled for being a carnivore or whatever.
[03:41:07.380 --> 03:41:09.640]   But so obviously to get through life,
[03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:10.760]   you have to make certain compromise.
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:12.720]   You're not gonna think about certain things.
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:15.760]   But I just think there is a sort of wish fulfillment.
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:17.000]   Like every time there's,
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:18.260]   why are we going to Mars and digging
[03:41:18.260 --> 03:41:20.400]   and flying this cool ass helicopter?
[03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:21.240]   We're looking for water.
[03:41:21.240 --> 03:41:23.680]   Like stipulate that water was there.
[03:41:23.680 --> 03:41:25.000]   Like, I believe there was water.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:26.160]   I think we should investigate
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:28.160]   and see what the geology was like.
[03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:29.840]   - But don't you think, so you're saying--
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:31.180]   - I don't think you're gonna get meaning from it.
[03:41:31.180 --> 03:41:32.020]   That's all I'm saying.
[03:41:32.020 --> 03:41:33.720]   I'm not saying it's not worth doing.
[03:41:33.720 --> 03:41:36.640]   I'm just saying there's a wish fulfillment aspect
[03:41:36.640 --> 03:41:39.820]   that people will find meaning for life from science.
[03:41:39.820 --> 03:41:44.160]   - Okay, but there's a complicated line here.
[03:41:44.160 --> 03:41:47.840]   What if it's this intelligent civilization
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:51.540]   living obviously probably not on Mars,
[03:41:51.540 --> 03:41:55.280]   but somewhere like in a neighboring galaxy that we,
[03:41:55.280 --> 03:41:58.400]   sorry, in a neighboring--
[03:41:58.400 --> 03:41:59.240]   - Star system.
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:02.280]   - Star system that we discover.
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:05.360]   Don't you think that profound change in meaning?
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:06.240]   - I mean, I guess, again,
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:09.120]   I assume that because of this pan-subramanic process
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:11.400]   or whatever, that the probability
[03:42:11.400 --> 03:42:12.960]   is much, much greater than zero.
[03:42:12.960 --> 03:42:14.920]   I mean, it's not one 100%,
[03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:16.580]   but it's much likelier than not
[03:42:16.580 --> 03:42:19.000]   that at least some living material from Earth
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:22.080]   has ejaculated itself into the solar system,
[03:42:22.080 --> 03:42:23.480]   into the universe, right, into our galaxy.
[03:42:23.480 --> 03:42:24.320]   - Beep that, please.
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:25.680]   (both laughing)
[03:42:25.680 --> 03:42:26.520]   - As well.
[03:42:26.520 --> 03:42:27.340]   - That's right.
[03:42:27.340 --> 03:42:29.560]   So the fact that that could happen
[03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:32.280]   and that you're holding a piece from a planetary body,
[03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:34.560]   one that couldn't support life as far as we know,
[03:42:34.560 --> 03:42:37.600]   but I could give next time if you play nice
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:39.000]   and you come on my podcast someday,
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:40.960]   I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars.
[03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:42.960]   So Mars theoretically could support stuff, right?
[03:42:42.960 --> 03:42:43.800]   - Moving on up.
[03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:46.080]   - So yeah, so I believe that there could be remnants
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:49.020]   of Earth in this, so that means there could be evolution.
[03:42:49.020 --> 03:42:51.400]   I don't think there's any chance that there's
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:53.860]   people using iPhones and having podcasts and stuff
[03:42:53.860 --> 03:42:54.700]   in proximate and term.
[03:42:54.700 --> 03:42:57.280]   - No, there's some chance though, right?
[03:42:57.280 --> 03:42:59.520]   So it's--
[03:42:59.520 --> 03:43:01.040]   - Again, yeah, I think the, well,
[03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:02.880]   obviously the simple statement to say
[03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:04.800]   it's much, much, much higher probability
[03:43:04.800 --> 03:43:07.560]   that life exists than technological life exists, right?
[03:43:07.560 --> 03:43:09.360]   I don't think we can argue that.
[03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:10.400]   It doesn't mean it's forbidden.
[03:43:10.400 --> 03:43:12.000]   Again, I'm not saying any of this is forbidden,
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.560]   not worth studying, not interesting.
[03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:14.560]   - It's a likelihood thing.
[03:43:14.560 --> 03:43:15.960]   - Yeah, and to answer your,
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:17.680]   I think you're wise to push back
[03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:20.140]   and like what does it matter what I'm doing?
[03:43:20.140 --> 03:43:21.880]   And I like to think about that, you know,
[03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:24.160]   because it's like what is the value of what you're doing?
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:25.840]   Like you have to answer that question
[03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:27.100]   or else at the end of your life,
[03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:28.540]   you'll have these existential, you know,
[03:43:28.540 --> 03:43:30.160]   kind of crises, right?
[03:43:30.160 --> 03:43:32.100]   So when I think about like who I am,
[03:43:32.100 --> 03:43:33.980]   part of my identity is answering
[03:43:33.980 --> 03:43:35.900]   and asking scientific questions.
[03:43:35.900 --> 03:43:38.340]   For me though, there is a religious kind of undercurrent
[03:43:38.340 --> 03:43:41.440]   that does undergird in some sense this quest.
[03:43:41.440 --> 03:43:42.940]   Again, I'm not like a practicing,
[03:43:42.940 --> 03:43:44.480]   I'm not like where I am, you know,
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:49.480]   like I'm not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism,
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:52.540]   but at the same token, I think as, you know,
[03:43:52.540 --> 03:43:54.000]   one of the things Einstein did say is that, you know,
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:57.620]   religion without science is blind or is lame
[03:43:57.620 --> 03:44:02.060]   and science without religion is lame, is blind and lame.
[03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:05.120]   Anyway, the point is that like you can't get meaning,
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:07.480]   you know, from just knowing facts.
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:10.160]   Like Wikipedia knows more than all of us will ever know,
[03:44:10.160 --> 03:44:11.760]   right, it has no wisdom.
[03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:13.880]   You know, wisdom, it means sapien,
[03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:16.600]   the word wisdom in Latin is sapien, we are wise.
[03:44:16.600 --> 03:44:18.360]   And by the way, do you know what we're,
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:21.240]   what our real name is Homo sapien sapien.
[03:44:21.240 --> 03:44:23.200]   So it's man who knows that he knows.
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:24.600]   Do you know what he knows?
[03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:25.680]   Do you know what the knowing is?
[03:44:25.680 --> 03:44:27.480]   It's that he's gonna die.
[03:44:27.480 --> 03:44:29.600]   We're the only creatures that know that we are gonna die.
[03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:31.400]   We don't know when we're gonna die.
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:33.920]   But like, you know, I have a cat,
[03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:36.560]   a fierce attack cat, it's beautiful.
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:38.280]   She doesn't know when she's gonna die.
[03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:40.800]   Doesn't mean I'm more valuable than her, I think I am.
[03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:42.440]   - The survival instinct is much,
[03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:45.860]   it's fundamentally different from like the knowledge
[03:44:45.860 --> 03:44:48.120]   of death and that's where the Ernest Becker comes in
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:49.720]   with the terror of death.
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:54.240]   And that's a creative force that seems to be more feature
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:58.060]   than bug about the human condition is that,
[03:44:58.060 --> 03:45:05.060]   I mean, it's a gift of knowing our own mortality.
[03:45:05.060 --> 03:45:09.960]   Yeah, to me, I mean, that's why, you know,
[03:45:09.960 --> 03:45:13.520]   I agree with you in some sense in terms of the aliens
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:17.080]   not being a thing that solves all mysteries.
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:19.520]   That's why, you know, my love has always been
[03:45:19.520 --> 03:45:23.960]   the human mind, so understanding who we are,
[03:45:23.960 --> 03:45:25.480]   what the hell are we?
[03:45:25.480 --> 03:45:29.100]   And I think your love has been an echo of that,
[03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:31.480]   which is where do we come from?
[03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:32.320]   - Yeah.
[03:45:32.320 --> 03:45:35.520]   - Or basically, as cheesy as it sounds, you know,
[03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:39.160]   Michio Kaku is away with words.
[03:45:39.160 --> 03:45:42.880]   If you can just like enjoy the, you know--
[03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:43.840]   - Oh, he speaks in complete,
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:45.680]   he's like Sam Harris of cosmology.
[03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:47.480]   I mean, he speaks in complete paragraphs.
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:51.560]   - But like also unapologetically, he says, you know,
[03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:54.440]   we will know God or we will know the mind of God
[03:45:54.440 --> 03:45:56.740]   or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things.
[03:45:56.740 --> 03:46:03.480]   That's exciting that physics might be able to find equations
[03:46:03.480 --> 03:46:07.480]   that unlock our origins at the very core
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:10.660]   and like the fabric of it all too, and not just our origins.
[03:46:10.660 --> 03:46:14.460]   You know, what's at the beginning?
[03:46:15.460 --> 03:46:18.000]   Something tells me we're too dumb to truly understand
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:19.240]   what's at the beginning, but--
[03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:21.200]   - I think we should be humble in that way.
[03:46:21.200 --> 03:46:23.240]   I mean, again, another thing is, you know,
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:28.320]   you ever hear the saying, like, we share 99% of our DNA
[03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:31.320]   with chimps or bonobos or whatever?
[03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:33.000]   I share like probably more than that.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.440]   You know, sometimes I wish we shared like 100%.
[03:46:35.440 --> 03:46:37.280]   Like, that'd be so much more interesting.
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:40.360]   Like, oh, there's 50% of a fruit fly or a banana.
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:42.580]   Like, no, no, no, there's something,
[03:46:42.580 --> 03:46:44.680]   but that should make us feel more precious.
[03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:46.620]   And I almost feel like discovering life
[03:46:46.620 --> 03:46:49.900]   on another planet, whatever solar system,
[03:46:49.900 --> 03:46:52.200]   would cause a diminution of humanity.
[03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:54.560]   Like, the one thing I do hold fast to from religion,
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:55.960]   I don't know where I am with God.
[03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:57.120]   Like, do I believe in God?
[03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:59.480]   I think that's an unanswerable question,
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:02.520]   but I have some thoughts about it.
[03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:05.900]   But by the same token, I think the one thing
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:07.520]   I do get from religion is that every human
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:10.660]   has infinite worth, 'cause we are, in a religious capacity,
[03:47:10.660 --> 03:47:12.640]   considered to be equal to God.
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:15.320]   In other words, we are gods, not to be like,
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:17.000]   but we can contemplate what God did.
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:18.240]   We have aspects of God.
[03:47:18.240 --> 03:47:19.080]   We have free will.
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:21.360]   God had free will if he exists.
[03:47:21.360 --> 03:47:23.000]   Again, I can't prove that God exists,
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:24.680]   otherwise you wouldn't have any credit
[03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:26.160]   for believing in God. - This is interesting.
[03:47:26.160 --> 03:47:29.840]   I mean, it's like I'm talking to Einstein here,
[03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:31.160]   but let me ask anyway.
[03:47:31.160 --> 03:47:32.960]   - Can you clip that for my clips, John?
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:34.640]   (both laughing)
[03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:39.020]   - For somebody who's looking at the young universe,
[03:47:39.020 --> 03:47:40.440]   at the early universe,
[03:47:42.360 --> 03:47:47.200]   and are talking about God and are agnostic,
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:49.460]   who do you think is God?
[03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:54.760]   - So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts.
[03:47:54.760 --> 03:47:56.980]   It was Sam Harris this past summer.
[03:47:56.980 --> 03:48:01.000]   And one of the things I liked about that conversation
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:04.880]   is he talked a lot about happiness and meditation.
[03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:06.640]   And he said something that's really resonated with me,
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:07.720]   and I've been working it around
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:09.240]   and trying to work on it my own way.
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:12.960]   But he said like, "You can never be happy.
[03:48:12.960 --> 03:48:16.240]   You can only become happy."
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:18.440]   And I'm trying to take it a little bit further than that,
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:19.480]   'cause I think it's interesting.
[03:48:19.480 --> 03:48:21.320]   Like meditation is like, you're not like,
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:23.040]   "Oh, I'm happy and now like,
[03:48:23.040 --> 03:48:24.680]   oh, my kid came in and now I'm not happy."
[03:48:24.680 --> 03:48:26.800]   They're like, "No, you can be satisfied."
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:27.920]   Kurt Vonnegut said like,
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:29.200]   you ever catch this sometimes, Alex?
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:30.320]   You're like walking around, you're like,
[03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:32.000]   "Life is fricking amazing.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:32.840]   Like I'm happy."
[03:48:32.840 --> 03:48:34.400]   And Kurt Vonnegut said,
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:36.340]   "You should say to yourself every time that happens,
[03:48:36.340 --> 03:48:37.560]   like a little mantra, like,
[03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:40.200]   'If this isn't goodness, if this isn't happiness,
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:41.200]   nothing is.'"
[03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:43.160]   Just remind yourself how awesome it is,
[03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:45.200]   every breath, everything that you do,
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:46.080]   when you make an impact.
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:49.520]   Even some of the bad stuff that happens, good, it's good.
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:51.800]   So Sam said that, and it made me think,
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:55.000]   'cause I was like, "Well, what does it really mean
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:56.880]   to be happy?"
[03:48:56.880 --> 03:49:01.880]   Because like, I can think of about two or three ways
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:04.840]   that right now I could double my happiness.
[03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:06.480]   Now like, win the lottery or whatever,
[03:49:06.480 --> 03:49:07.560]   like I could double my happiness.
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:08.960]   There's only a few ways though, right?
[03:49:08.960 --> 03:49:12.400]   Like, you know, I had this kind of thought,
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:15.320]   like how many boats can you water ski behind?
[03:49:15.320 --> 03:49:17.080]   Like you had twice as many followers,
[03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:19.480]   now you got 2 million followers, 5 million, whatever.
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:20.720]   It doesn't do anything.
[03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:22.000]   It's called the hedonic treadmill.
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:23.200]   Like once you get to a certain level,
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:26.320]   it takes a lot more, you know, change and followers,
[03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:28.880]   money, impact, women, whatever you want
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:32.280]   to make you have one more quanta of happiness, right?
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:36.220]   On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy.
[03:49:36.220 --> 03:49:39.640]   I can make your life miserable in an infinite number of ways.
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:42.240]   In other words, there's more space to make your life
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:44.520]   unhappy than happy.
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:46.200]   And so I thought about that in the context
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:48.740]   of what Sam said about happiness.
[03:49:48.740 --> 03:49:52.360]   So it's sort of like, yeah, it's an expression of entropy.
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:54.940]   And that what you should be doing in life
[03:49:54.940 --> 03:49:59.040]   is doing that which will cause you devastation
[03:49:59.040 --> 03:50:00.720]   if it goes away.
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:02.680]   Because those are the things that like,
[03:50:02.680 --> 03:50:05.360]   are where you're reducing entropy.
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:08.160]   Like a kid, like anyone who's a parent
[03:50:08.160 --> 03:50:10.320]   knows instantly what I'm talking about.
[03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:13.840]   Like how to make your life a billion times worse.
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:16.480]   But there's no way to make your life a billion times better.
[03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:17.840]   And so thinking about that,
[03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:21.120]   now turning it to the question of God's existence,
[03:50:21.120 --> 03:50:24.440]   I feel like there's no way that you can believe in God,
[03:50:24.440 --> 03:50:28.420]   to misquote Sam, but there's ways that you can become
[03:50:28.420 --> 03:50:29.400]   a believer in God.
[03:50:29.400 --> 03:50:31.460]   In other words, you could increase
[03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:34.640]   the Bayesian confidence level that there is some,
[03:50:34.640 --> 03:50:36.720]   and let's not call it God 'cause that's a freighted term.
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:38.920]   Let's just call it some infinite source of goodness
[03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:42.760]   or our beautiful power in the universe, right?
[03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:44.040]   Simple things can do that.
[03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:47.800]   You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life.
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:50.480]   And we have this bias as humans towards negativity,
[03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:52.160]   negativity bias, well-known fact.
[03:50:52.160 --> 03:50:56.280]   So what I wanna do is, let's call God good, right?
[03:50:56.280 --> 03:50:59.680]   That's where it comes from, God good, same words in German.
[03:50:59.680 --> 03:51:02.600]   And when we think about what is good,
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:06.920]   let's do those things that would devastate us.
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:09.920]   And a lot of that could be relationships.
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:14.600]   And there's a powerful concept from network theory,
[03:51:14.600 --> 03:51:18.160]   which is that the number of connections in a network,
[03:51:18.160 --> 03:51:19.640]   you know, I'm just saying it for your own,
[03:51:19.640 --> 03:51:21.680]   it grows as the square of the elements in the matrix,
[03:51:21.680 --> 03:51:22.640]   in the number, right?
[03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:24.600]   So you think of a matrix with N people,
[03:51:24.600 --> 03:51:26.560]   you know person one, two, three, four,
[03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:28.000]   and then there's four other people.
[03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:31.640]   There's 16 different pairs, but half of them overlap.
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:34.600]   The diagonal is where you know yourself.
[03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:37.040]   But that still grows as N squared.
[03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:41.800]   So those connections increase and decrease, right?
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:43.640]   You ever have two friends that are fighting,
[03:51:43.640 --> 03:51:44.880]   and like you're kinda upset,
[03:51:44.880 --> 03:51:46.600]   even though you're not fighting with either one of them?
[03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:48.400]   So like a network grows like that.
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:50.560]   So you wanna increase your network as much as possible,
[03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:54.720]   but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.
[03:51:54.720 --> 03:51:58.760]   And I think in doing so, you make yourself fragile,
[03:51:58.760 --> 03:51:59.800]   not anti-fragile.
[03:51:59.800 --> 03:52:02.360]   And I think that is where purpose
[03:52:02.360 --> 03:52:05.640]   and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.
[03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:08.080]   - So that is a source of meaning,
[03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:10.960]   maximizing the goodness in life,
[03:52:10.960 --> 03:52:13.120]   and the way you know it's good,
[03:52:13.120 --> 03:52:16.560]   is if it's taken away, it would devastate you.
[03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:17.400]   - That's one way.
[03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:21.240]   Think about it, your brand, your business,
[03:52:21.240 --> 03:52:23.400]   your spouse, your kids.
[03:52:23.400 --> 03:52:26.680]   I mean, parents can't, I've known parents that have,
[03:52:26.680 --> 03:52:28.640]   Jim Simons, here's a perfect example.
[03:52:28.640 --> 03:52:30.800]   He's one of my oldest friends and mentors.
[03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:35.200]   He is one of the richest people on earth.
[03:52:35.200 --> 03:52:36.920]   Gulf Stream, Mega Yacht,
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:39.760]   this is all documented, books about him.
[03:52:39.760 --> 03:52:41.640]   He lost two sons as adults.
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:46.320]   And I hear people say, "Oh, I'm so jealous of Jim Simons."
[03:52:46.320 --> 03:52:47.680]   Would you take everything?
[03:52:47.680 --> 03:52:51.040]   I don't know where he has that strength
[03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:53.840]   in his wife, Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara.
[03:52:53.840 --> 03:52:57.040]   I'm not like that.
[03:52:57.040 --> 03:53:00.320]   But some people are, there are angels that walk among us.
[03:53:00.320 --> 03:53:04.280]   And there's this famous prayer, it's like,
[03:53:04.280 --> 03:53:07.600]   God, there's an old saying,
[03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:09.360]   one of the hardest tests there are in life
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:10.720]   is to be given a lot of money.
[03:53:10.720 --> 03:53:13.480]   And you see it happens with people that win the lottery
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:15.600]   or whatever, or NFL football players
[03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:18.800]   after their career's over, they're broke, right?
[03:53:18.800 --> 03:53:20.800]   And I always joke, "God, please test me with money,
[03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:21.640]   "that'd be great."
[03:53:21.640 --> 03:53:23.920]   But in reality, you should never say,
[03:53:23.920 --> 03:53:26.600]   I'm gonna, I want what X person has,
[03:53:26.600 --> 03:53:28.200]   unless you're willing to take everything.
[03:53:28.200 --> 03:53:30.600]   And you'll find you won't wanna take everything.
[03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:36.720]   - Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects
[03:53:36.720 --> 03:53:39.840]   of fame, of money, of power on people.
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:45.560]   It blinds people.
[03:53:45.560 --> 03:53:50.280]   And I wonder about that for myself,
[03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:53.720]   because it seems like in themselves,
[03:53:53.720 --> 03:53:55.200]   these are definitely not the goals
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:53:59.800]   I'm pretty much afraid, I'm not desirous,
[03:53:59.800 --> 03:54:03.040]   and I'm definitely afraid of each of those things,
[03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:07.280]   money, fame, and power.
[03:54:07.280 --> 03:54:11.840]   But it seems the dreams I have as consequences
[03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:14.240]   can often have these things.
[03:54:14.240 --> 03:54:16.760]   And I'm really afraid of becoming something
[03:54:16.760 --> 03:54:20.680]   that would disappoint me when I was younger,
[03:54:20.680 --> 03:54:24.120]   that I wouldn't recognize.
[03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:26.360]   You know, 'cause change happens gradually.
[03:54:26.360 --> 03:54:30.560]   - But are you using yourself as the touchstone
[03:54:30.560 --> 03:54:32.400]   to use the assay or not?
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:36.040]   What is your rubric to apprise if you have lived up
[03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:38.880]   to that 12-year-old, whatever-year-old Lex?
[03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:41.880]   How will you know or not know if you've let yourself down?
[03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:45.080]   Or, I always think, live to impress yourself.
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:47.680]   I don't care if I have followers.
[03:54:47.680 --> 03:54:50.360]   It's nice, or whatever, but it's hedonic,
[03:54:50.360 --> 03:54:51.640]   and it's just never-ending,
[03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.640]   'cause you'll always see the next level.
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:54.840]   But I think it's pretty damn cool
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:54:56.560]   that I've gotten to go to these places,
[03:54:56.560 --> 03:54:58.160]   the South Pole, and I've done these things,
[03:54:58.160 --> 03:54:59.560]   and I've made a family,
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:04.000]   and I'm able to teleport my values into the future
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:07.320]   through my children, and I've had ideological children.
[03:55:07.320 --> 03:55:12.160]   So by what metric have you not already, A, impressed yourself
[03:55:12.160 --> 03:55:13.280]   and, B, could you let yourself down?
[03:55:13.280 --> 03:55:14.360]   I don't wanna turn this into therapy.
[03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:15.920]   - I think some of it is psychology.
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:19.280]   For me, I'm very much just never,
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:21.520]   I'm highly self-critical.
[03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:24.360]   I'm never happy, never happy with what I've done,
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:27.080]   but I'm always happy in the way that you describe,
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:29.880]   which is that the Vonnegut thing,
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:32.600]   where you just, often during the day,
[03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:34.640]   I will feel, I don't know,
[03:55:34.640 --> 03:55:39.200]   I just remember just eating beef jerky
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:40.840]   and being truly happy.
[03:55:40.840 --> 03:55:44.640]   That was just last night, and I have that all the time.
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:48.940]   And that, to me, is why, I mean,
[03:55:48.940 --> 03:55:51.280]   that feels to me like a healthy way to live life,
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:55.000]   and at least for me, it's the one I really enjoy.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:57.600]   A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self-critical,
[03:55:57.600 --> 03:56:00.480]   so hard on yourself, is not a good way to go,
[03:56:00.480 --> 03:56:02.120]   but more and more as I get older,
[03:56:02.120 --> 03:56:04.560]   I realize it's just who I am.
[03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:08.000]   You have to at a certain point accept,
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.680]   this is how I'm always going to be, this self-critical.
[03:56:10.680 --> 03:56:12.160]   - It's like the Oracle of Delphi, right?
[03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:13.760]   You know thyself.
[03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:15.080]   But I wanna leave you with one last thing,
[03:56:15.080 --> 03:56:16.960]   which is to say, just on this topic,
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:19.940]   it could be different, right?
[03:56:19.940 --> 03:56:22.800]   We could go down to the ocean and get some krill
[03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:24.800]   instead of the 7-Eleven.
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:28.320]   It could be that we have no other taste buds,
[03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:32.040]   and Eric's talked, the four dimensions of,
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:33.440]   the vibration of your tongue, right?
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:35.920]   It could be like there's one,
[03:56:35.920 --> 03:56:39.400]   and it's just like, not Memphis barbecue,
[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:42.680]   or whatever you like in your slim gym.
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:44.440]   It could be something, it could be very boring.
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:47.480]   Similarly, what if that's a clue?
[03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:49.040]   What if that's giving us evidence?
[03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:50.660]   Here's another clue.
[03:56:50.660 --> 03:56:52.040]   There are many animals, most animals,
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:54.380]   have single monocolor vision.
[03:56:54.380 --> 03:56:56.940]   They only see in black and white intensity.
[03:56:56.940 --> 03:56:59.040]   They only have rods and no cones.
[03:56:59.040 --> 03:57:03.040]   We could be like that, but we're not.
[03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:04.860]   Why is that not a clue?
[03:57:04.860 --> 03:57:08.940]   God's not gonna hit you over the head
[03:57:08.940 --> 03:57:10.080]   and say, "Here I am,"
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:11.340]   'cause then everybody would believe in him.
[03:57:11.340 --> 03:57:12.860]   And there's very simplistic, I've had debates,
[03:57:12.860 --> 03:57:15.500]   even with famous atheists like Lawrence Krauss,
[03:57:15.500 --> 03:57:17.640]   who's self-declared militant atheist.
[03:57:18.580 --> 03:57:20.880]   And I was like, "Well, I don't believe in the same God
[03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:21.780]   "you don't believe in,
[03:57:21.780 --> 03:57:24.240]   "like some guy in a white beard and a chair.
[03:57:24.240 --> 03:57:25.660]   "That's infantile.
[03:57:25.660 --> 03:57:27.940]   "I gave that away a long time ago."
[03:57:27.940 --> 03:57:29.360]   But what if there are clues?
[03:57:29.360 --> 03:57:33.200]   What if Yang-Mills theory, Maxwell's equation,
[03:57:33.200 --> 03:57:35.040]   those are beautiful.
[03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:38.680]   If you've ever seen, expressed in tensor notation,
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:41.640]   Einstein's equations, or Maxwell's equations,
[03:57:41.640 --> 03:57:44.920]   and then Maxwell's equations riding on Einstein's,
[03:57:44.920 --> 03:57:47.720]   it's unbelievably beautiful.
[03:57:47.720 --> 03:57:49.420]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[03:57:49.420 --> 03:57:52.540]   That we can comprehend it, that's a crack.
[03:57:52.540 --> 03:57:54.020]   Maybe that's where the light gets in,
[03:57:54.020 --> 03:57:56.940]   and the light is what reveals what's beautiful.
[03:57:56.940 --> 03:57:59.060]   So I don't believe in God.
[03:57:59.060 --> 03:58:00.540]   I think that's a stupid notion.
[03:58:00.540 --> 03:58:02.200]   Do I believe in God?
[03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:04.940]   Sometimes I wonder if God believes in me
[03:58:04.940 --> 03:58:06.340]   more than if I believe in,
[03:58:06.340 --> 03:58:07.540]   he needs Brian Keating.
[03:58:07.540 --> 03:58:11.180]   It's like one of my friends is a rapper,
[03:58:11.180 --> 03:58:14.780]   he's like, "What would I be doing if I were God?"
[03:58:14.780 --> 03:58:16.420]   Exactly what God's doing right now.
[03:58:16.420 --> 03:58:17.760]   You think I know more than God?
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:18.600]   Give me a break.
[03:58:18.600 --> 03:58:23.300]   - Leaving clues of beauty for these hairless apes.
[03:58:23.300 --> 03:58:24.220]   - Yeah.
[03:58:24.220 --> 03:58:26.140]   - And to see what they do with this,
[03:58:26.140 --> 03:58:31.140]   and then marvel at both the tragedy
[03:58:31.140 --> 03:58:34.540]   of what those apes do to each other,
[03:58:34.540 --> 03:58:39.500]   and the rare moments of when they have,
[03:58:39.500 --> 03:58:41.520]   when they understand, understand deeply
[03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:43.420]   about how the world works.
[03:58:43.420 --> 03:58:45.260]   Brian, you're an incredible human being.
[03:58:45.260 --> 03:58:48.500]   I'm a big fan, and I'm really honored that you was,
[03:58:48.500 --> 03:58:51.780]   first of all, shower me with rocks from the moon.
[03:58:51.780 --> 03:58:52.760]   - From space.
[03:58:52.760 --> 03:58:53.820]   - From space.
[03:58:53.820 --> 03:58:54.660]   - Space dust.
[03:58:54.660 --> 03:58:55.660]   - Space dust.
[03:58:55.660 --> 03:58:59.140]   - And crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals.
[03:58:59.140 --> 03:58:59.980]   - Yeah.
[03:58:59.980 --> 03:59:01.780]   - That you can use for good.
[03:59:01.780 --> 03:59:03.640]   - And tell me your story,
[03:59:03.640 --> 03:59:05.780]   and spend your really valuable time with me today.
[03:59:05.780 --> 03:59:06.740]   This was amazing.
[03:59:06.740 --> 03:59:08.020]   - That was a great pleasure for me, Lex.
[03:59:08.020 --> 03:59:08.940]   Thank you so much.
[03:59:08.940 --> 03:59:11.700]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:59:11.700 --> 03:59:12.860]   with Brian Keating.
[03:59:12.860 --> 03:59:14.260]   To support this podcast,

[03:59:17.340 --> 03:59:19.400]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:59:19.400 --> 03:59:21.080]   from Galileo Galilei.
[03:59:21.080 --> 03:59:23.620]   In questions of science,
[03:59:23.620 --> 03:59:25.300]   the authority of a thousand
[03:59:25.300 --> 03:59:29.640]   is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.
[03:59:29.640 --> 03:59:32.600]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:59:32.600 --> 03:59:35.180]   (upbeat music)
[03:59:35.180 --> 03:59:37.760]   (upbeat music)
