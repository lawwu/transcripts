[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   the book of Joshua, in the fourth chapter, verses 21 to 24.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.480]   And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.040]   fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.600]   Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.280]   over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.840]   we were gone over; that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.800]   that it is mighty, that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.560]   Now I am calling attention to this incident here recorded in this book of Joshua because
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.320]   it seems to me to provide us with a parallel and indeed at the same time with a great deal
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.280]   of instruction with regard to the whole question of revival which we are trying to consider
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120]   together these Sunday mornings.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   And we are doing that, let me explain again, because this happens to be 1959 and is the
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.040]   100th anniversary of a great movement of the Spirit of God in revival in different
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.720]   countries a hundred years agoâ€”in America, in Northern Ireland, in Wales, in Scotland,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.360]   Sweden, and in various other places.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.080]   And here it seems to me we have something which helps us to consider this.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   This year, 1959, makes us think of 1859.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   Well in exactly the same way, we find that God had commended Moses to do something which
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.960]   was going to be a kind of reminder to the children of Israel of what God had done for
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   them.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   Here were the children of Israel passing over the Jordan, rather through the Jordan, in
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   order to enter into the promised land of Canaan.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.600]   God worked a miracle, and he commends these people to take up twelve stones from the very
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.440]   spot where the priests had been standing in the river of Jordan, in order that they may
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   set them up as a memorial outside a town, so that in ages to come, when the descendants
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600]   of that generation, the children of Israel, should happen to be passing in that direction
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.840]   and should see these stones, they should be provoked to ask the question, "What mean
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.040]   these stones?"
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   And then they would be able to give them the answer, and they would remind them of how
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.400]   God had done this wonderful thing, and had enabled them to walk through the Jordan, as
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.360]   he had done a similar thing in enabling them to walk through the Red Sea on dry land.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.440]   What mean these stones?
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   And we are considering the answer.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.720]   Now that is the position in which we find ourselves this year.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.960]   Books are written, articles are written on this great revival of a hundred years ago.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   Meetings of celebration are held, and are to be held, and so on.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.840]   But the question is, what does it all mean?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.560]   What is it all telling us?
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.360]   What is the purpose of this?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.880]   Why do we thus turn aside and spend a number of Sunday mornings on this particular thing?
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.020]   Well now, we have already started answering that question.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:07.240]   The first thing of which we are reminded is a fact, something that literally has happened.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.040]   What happened a hundred years ago found its way into the newspapers, on the front pages.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.400]   It was hot news.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.680]   This isn't theory, therefore.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   This isn't just a matter of thought.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.840]   This is literally something that has taken place, as these events have taken place in
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.080]   the history of the children of Israel.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.720]   And we furthermore have been trying to consider the general character of what is called a
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   revival.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.600]   We are not confined to 1858 and '59.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.960]   It's one of a series, as I was showing you.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.560]   And I was indicating that there are certain general characteristics which you all must
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.080]   invariably find in a revival.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.640]   We have been looking at some of them, how the Spirit of God comes upon a people.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   The first thing they are aware of is the glory and the majesty and the greatness of God,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.320]   and are humbled beneath it, silent, convicted, conscious of sin.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.040]   And they cry out unto God, and then become aware of God's way and God's provision
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.720]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.160]   And they begin to be filled with praise and joy and thanksgiving.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.240]   Then they feel a burden for the soul of others, and so they spend all their time in talking
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.160]   about this, praying about it.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.400]   And thus this movement spreads, and large numbers who are outside the church become
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   influenced and affected, drawn and attracted and converted, and join the Christian church.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.200]   Now I ended by saying this, and it is a very vital part of the description of a revival,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.960]   that always in a time of revival, the Holy Spirit seems to be presiding and is in charge.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   The Holy Spirit, if one may use such an expression, seems to be in the very atmosphere.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.320]   The whole district or country seems to be charged with the power of the Spirit.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.720]   Thus you will find people converted on their way to a meeting, even before they get to
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   the meeting, suddenly awakened in the midst of the night and convicted of sin.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.680]   This presidency of the Holy Spirit over everything and the life of the whole community.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   Well now there are some of the general characteristics which we have already considered, but we must
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.800]   proceed to emphasize certain special points, which seem to me to be of great significance
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.440]   and of great importance.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.800]   Here is one.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.120]   It is characteristic of revival that all classes are affected by it.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.020]   People of all classes, people of all ages, people of all temperaments, people of all
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.960]   intellectual types.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.440]   That is a point that is well worthy of elaboration.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.160]   We haven't the time to do so, but I am emphasizing it to the extent I am for this reason.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:25.000]   That here is one of the final answers to those who would dismiss evangelical conversion in
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.360]   terms of psychology.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   It is not confined to special types, to the so-called religious type.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.400]   Something is more striking in the story of revivals, how you get a cross-section of every
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:50.160]   conceivable type and group in society, irrespective of classes, ages, intellect, temperament,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.400]   and everything else.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.280]   A most astonishing feature, but which is found with strange regularity in the story of all
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   revivals.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.320]   And then another thing that is characteristic is this, that a revival is something that
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:12.780]   thus comes, as I have said, it lasts for a while, and then it passes.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.880]   Nothing is more interesting than that.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   Emphasizing you see that it is this definite action of God, comes suddenly or gradually,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:29.640]   works to some great climax, and then it ends, perhaps suddenly, perhaps gradually.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.920]   There is something discreet about it.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.640]   Sometimes you can give the very date of its beginning and the date at which it ended.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.360]   That I think again is a matter of the greatest possible significance.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.340]   Establishing once more that it is the work of God, and that it is not something which
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.080]   belongs to the realm of mere psychological experiences.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.240]   Because with them, as long as you have the stimulus and the factors, you continue to
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.520]   get your result.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.260]   But here, that is not the case.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.720]   And that brings me to say a word about the results, the results of revival.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.220]   And here are the points that need to be emphasized are these.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.260]   The results of revival are abiding.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:22.080]   I mean by that, that in contradistinction to what is so generally true in evangelistic
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:33.640]   campaigns, the people who profess conversion and give indications of conversion continue.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.000]   There are exceptions, there are some who fall back.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.900]   But this is the great feature of revival, that the men and women who are converted by
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.920]   this power that has entered into the life of the Church, continue.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.200]   It isn't that they come forward as the result of an appeal, and you imagine that great
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.300]   things are happening, but that you find afterwards that perhaps only ten percent of them hold,
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.240]   which is the figure that is expected to hold by most evangelists.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.740]   That is not the case in revival.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.620]   In a revival, it is a very exceptional thing for people not to hold.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.680]   But they abide and they continue.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.920]   Now you will find that the literature is full of this.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   I have been reminding myself of it again this week.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   I have been reading descriptions given by a number of ministers a hundred years ago,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.080]   and every one of them volunteers this selfsame point, that the people were standing and were
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   holding.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.880]   It wasn't something that only lasted an evening.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.200]   Of course, they didn't test their meetings, they didn't call people to come forward.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.840]   And there again is an interesting point of difference between an evangelistic campaign
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.320]   and a revival, that in an evangelistic campaign you have to plead with people to come forward.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.800]   In a revival you don't.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   They come without your asking them.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.880]   That was put very well by a man who was in the revival that has happened in the Congo
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.640]   in these recent years.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.360]   You may have read that little book called Something Happened, and the man puts it there
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   very eloquently.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.600]   He said, "There I had been preaching for twenty years in that area, and pleading with
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.380]   people to decide for Christ at the end of the meetings, trying to persuade them to come
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.240]   forward.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   And I wasn't succeeding.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.280]   But then," he said, "this came, this happened.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   And now," he said, "there was no need to ask them to come forward."
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.640]   The difficulty was, in a sense, to deal with the numbers who did come forward.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.760]   They didn't come forward while he was still preaching.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   He couldn't stop them.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.520]   Now that is the kind of thing, I say, that you get in a revival, and the results are
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   abiding.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.240]   There are certain concrete facts that can be given.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.960]   I'm going to give you some figures.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.680]   I've hesitated to do so because figures have by now become rather unrealistic in this age
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.320]   which attaches such significance to figures, and doesn't wait to see whether they're
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.200]   true figures, but is so anxious to proclaim them immediately.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.360]   Nevertheless the figures are interesting.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.040]   I'm emphasizing not that a given number came forward at the end of a meeting.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   I am going to give you figures of people who joined the Christian Church and who continue
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.560]   to be active and zealous members.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:34.040]   It is said that from 1730 to 1745 in the United States, when that great awakening took place
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.440]   under Jonathan Edwards and the Tenants and Whitfield and others, that some 50,000 people
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.920]   joined the Christian Churches.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:55.200]   In 1858, in 1857 to 1859, in that great revival that then swept the United States, it is computed
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.360]   that half a million people joined the Christian Church.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Notice my emphasis.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.920]   They joined the Christian Church, and they were not admitted immediately.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   They were tested, they were examined, they were instructed as catechumens, and they were
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   trained.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.960]   I'm not talking about decisions.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.480]   We've become so accustomed to that they didn't do that sort of thing in those days.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   Let's get that right out of our minds.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.840]   I am referring to people who, having given such true evidence of their conversion and
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.280]   their regeneration, were admitted into the full membership of the Christian Church.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.240]   Half a million a hundred years ago in the United States.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:44.400]   One hundred thousand in Ulster alone joined the Churches, and in Wales, 50,000.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   When you remember the population figures, you see the significance of these striking
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   facts.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.160]   And this is a thing to be emphasized also, that a great zeal for God and for holiness
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:06.520]   becomes manifest in the members of the Church and in these converts, invariably.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   The meetings are crowded, the people are anxious to work, every enterprise in connection with
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.000]   the Church is given a mighty stimulus.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   You can read, if you like, Edwin Ror's book on the Second Evangelical Awakening, which
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.800]   will give you striking facts in that respect.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.440]   It will show you the number of things that came out of that revival of a hundred years
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.620]   ago.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:35.120]   Not some passing emotion, but something so deep and so profound that people are consumed
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.600]   with a zeal for God and for his name and for his cause.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.400]   And new churches were built in large numbers.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.640]   Not only did the existing churches become too small, they had to build new churches
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.120]   all together.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.080]   You see, when you get a revival, as I was emphasizing last Sunday, it is the Church,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.700]   it starts in the Church, and the Church is built up.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.640]   But so often you have evangelistic campaigns and the churches are left exactly where they
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   were.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.040]   But a hundred years ago, in that short time, the churches all became filled to overflowing
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.400]   and that they had to build these fresh churches.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:21.720]   Ministerial candidates, men called to the ministry, the numbers were enormously increased.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.980]   And this is something I say that always happens in a period of revival.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.840]   And then, speaking still more generally, in a time of revival you will find that the moral
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:40.400]   tone and the moral level, not only of the Church but of the world outside the Church,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.200]   is visibly affected and raised.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:50.120]   You can read statistics provided by the public authorities with respect to prosecutions in
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.800]   police courts and other courts for drunkenness and various other things, and the figures
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.400]   are simply staggering.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.360]   And how practices, evil practices, that had characterized the life of a district or a
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.720]   town suddenly disappear.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.000]   There is a famous instance of this.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.480]   There was a great and famous preacher in North Wales about a hundred and fifty years ago
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.040]   by the name of John Elias.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   That man preached one sermon at a famous fair, at a place called Rithlin, a fair that was
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.160]   famous for its debauchery and vice and evil and sin and wrongdoing.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.320]   That man, by preaching one sermon, put an end to that fair once and forever.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.080]   He killed it and it was never revived.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.520]   Now that is the sort of thing you see that you get in a time of revival.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.360]   But you can have great evangelistic campaigns and then you are given the figures for vice
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.320]   and crime and you see that they are going up instead of coming down.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   You might think from the reports you read that the whole country has become religious,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.280]   but when you read the figures of vice and crime, I say, you find it steadily going up.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.080]   That is never true in a revival.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.680]   Even people who are not converted are influenced and affected.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.440]   A sobriety enters into the life of the whole community.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:23.040]   And the general effects of revival will last for quite a number of years after the revival.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.760]   Well, there are some interesting facts.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.320]   Well, now hitherto we have been looking at the phenomenon of revival in general.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:38.480]   But I do want to say just a word about particular variations which take place in different revivals
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   in different places and in different times.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:48.040]   While they all share certain general characteristics, you do find these most interesting and to
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.320]   me fascinating variations.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   Take for instance the way in which a revival starts and what can be of greater interest
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.440]   to us than that.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.520]   Now here, as I have said, it may be sudden or it may be gradual.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.480]   A revival may come quite unexpectedly.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.480]   Or it may be the case that a number of people have been burdened and have been concerned
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.160]   and have been praying, perhaps over months and perhaps even over years.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.880]   Have you read these stories?
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.520]   I do plead with you to do so.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.880]   Read either of these two books that have been written on the revival in Ulster a hundred
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   years ago.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.760]   If we can help you to get them, we will be delighted to do so.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   But I plead with you to read the facts.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.040]   And you will see some of these points illustrated.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.840]   Sometimes it is just a handful of people who have been concerned and burdened and God answers
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   them.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.800]   Well, there are those variations.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.920]   And again, it may come in different types of meeting.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.960]   Sometimes a revival breaks out in a prayer meeting.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.680]   Not some great crowded meeting, but just a little prayer meeting with a handful of people.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.200]   You see, in Northern Ireland it was three men rarely who met together regularly to pray,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   just three men.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.640]   It has sometimes been just two.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.360]   It does not matter.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.760]   In New York a hundred years ago it was one man who prayed alone for some time in that
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.720]   famous midday prayer meeting.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.160]   So it may come in a prayer meeting.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.240]   Or it may happen in a preaching service.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.200]   It may even happen when an evangelist is holding a series of regular meetings.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.600]   He started to have an evangelistic campaign, but suddenly it becomes a revival, something
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.840]   quite different.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   There is no limit, therefore, to the ways in which it may start.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.800]   Jonathan Edwards tells us that he has no doubt at all that the sudden, tragic death of a
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.200]   person in the town of Northampton in which he ministered was probably the thing that
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.320]   rarely proved to be the factor that God used.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   A calamity, some strange happening, something that alarms people or astonishes them, something
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.840]   that makes them realize the fleeting character of life in this world, these are the things
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.640]   that God has often used.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.160]   Sometimes a revival starts in a great city.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.440]   Sometimes it starts in a village.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.120]   Sometimes it starts in a hamlet.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.840]   I am emphasizing these things because they are to me the most glorious things of all.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.560]   You see, when man does something, he likes to do it in the big cities, doesn't he?
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.200]   And he does it in a big way.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   And he feels that that is essential to success.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.040]   Do you know, my friends, this is the wonderful thing?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.920]   The next revival may break out in a little hamlet that you and I have never heard of.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.560]   And it is a burden upon my heart and upon my mind.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.320]   And I am afraid in this respect, lest we here in this great city of London and in this big
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:08.720]   building may be passed by and God will bring us to naught and to nothing and do this mighty
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.240]   thing in a little unknown hamlet with a little group of people.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.980]   That is what happens in revival.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.400]   It can happen anywhere.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.000]   Thank God.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.400]   That is what makes this life so hopeful and so romantic at the same time.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.840]   There is no limit.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   And then it may happen with a very small number, as I have been saying, or it may happen in
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.040]   a great crowd.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.240]   God isn't confined to numbers or to anything else.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.120]   The Bible is full of that.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.960]   God's greatest things have been done with small numbers, with remnants.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.640]   But it can equally happen with a great crowd.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.720]   And that is why people who try to lay down rules and regulations and who think because
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.220]   it happened once in this way, it is going to happen again in the same way, are showing
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.880]   a complete misunderstanding of the laws of the spiritual realm.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.440]   There are endless variations in the way in which it begins.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   And then consider the variations in the type of men that God uses in revival.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.000]   Another most fascinating theme.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.560]   Sometimes God has used in revival very great men.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:27.900]   Look at a man like Jonathan Edwards, one of the greatest philosophers of all time, certainly
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.580]   the greatest philosopher that the United States of America has ever produced.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.260]   Everybody has agreed about that.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.360]   That is why they are reprinting his works now, even men who are not primarily interested
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.680]   religiously.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.020]   He was such an outstanding philosopher.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.660]   He was the man that God used, above all others, two hundred years ago in the New England states.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:58.140]   Whitefield, by any assessment, was a great man, possibly the greatest orator that the
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.860]   English-speaking world has ever produced.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:11.140]   John Wesley, by any showing, was a great man, a genius of an organizer, and a most able
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.980]   intellectual man.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:19.300]   All these men of the eighteenth century were undoubtedly outstanding men of ability.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:26.180]   Yet they were the men who God used in bringing this great revival amongst the masses of the
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.580]   common people.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.060]   But here is the interesting thing.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.820]   God does not always use men like that.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.620]   He does sometimes.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.140]   That seems to have been the general rule, because Luther again was a great natural man,
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.880]   and so was Calvin, so was John Knox, so were all these men.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.420]   But you see, he does not always do that.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   When you come to a hundred years ago, you find something very different.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.700]   You find God now using simple, ignorant, unknown, most ordinary men.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.780]   He did that in the United States.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.980]   He did that in Ulster.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.620]   How many of you have ever heard of the name of James McQuilkin?
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.540]   Well, he was the man who was used in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.060]   James McQuilkin, a most ordinary man.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.420]   But God laid hold on him and began to use him.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.900]   It was exactly the same in Wales.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.340]   The name of the man most used there was David Morgan.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.260]   He was actually a minister of the gospel, but a very ordinary minister, an unknown minister,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.700]   a man of no gifts whatsoever.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.260]   God took hold of that man and used him like a lion for nearly two years.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.900]   A most ordinary man.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:49.700]   Isn't this something that is worthy of our careful contemplation?
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.980]   Shouldn't we reflect upon this?
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:59.740]   God taketh hold of the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   That's it.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.240]   It's a part of the principle.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.220]   It may be a great man, it may be a very little man.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.140]   It doesn't matter.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.700]   Then think of the area in which a revival takes place and the spread of revival.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.180]   It may be very local, it may remain local.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.660]   It may involve a whole district, it may involve a whole country.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.420]   Or as you see a hundred years ago and two hundred years ago, several countries at the
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.100]   same time.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.900]   All these facts are full of significance, especially when you think of these attacks
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.640]   of the psychologists who think that they can explain away religious phenomena in terms
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   of psychology.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.600]   I'm hoping to deal with that later.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.300]   But let me hurry now to a next question.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:46.980]   The question of the so-called phenomena that are in evidence sometimes during a revival.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.580]   Now again, there is great variation here.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.940]   Sometimes a revival may be very powerful and yet more or less quiet.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.860]   There may be a very deep and a very profound emotion.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.780]   Large numbers are converted, but quietly.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.660]   But it isn't always like that.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:14.260]   Indeed it comes nearer to being the rule in revival that certain phenomena begin to manifest
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.380]   themselves such as these.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:23.660]   That men and women are not only convicted of sin, but they are convicted by an agony
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.100]   with respect to sin.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.220]   It isn't merely that they see that they are sinners and that they must believe in the
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   Savior.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:36.700]   It comes to them with such overwhelming force that they become even physically ill.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.500]   They're in a literal agony of soul.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.060]   You remember the story of John Bunyan, don't you?
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.860]   He tells it in grace abounding how he had such an agony of conviction for nearly 18
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.300]   months that on one occasion he even felt envious of geese that were grazing in a field, wished
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.020]   that he hadn't been a man at all.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.380]   This agony, this terrible conviction.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.380]   Well you get that in revival.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.380]   People are in an agony of soul and groan audibly.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:11.180]   They may cry and sob and agonize audibly.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.180]   But it doesn't even stop at that.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.260]   Sometimes people are so convicted and so feel the power of the Spirit that they literally
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:25.660]   faint and fall to the ground.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:33.820]   Sometimes there are even convulsions, literal convulsions, physical convulsions.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.660]   And sometimes people seem to fall into a state of unconsciousness, into a kind of trance,
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.700]   and may remain like that for hours.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.260]   Now all I'm anxious to do this morning is to remind you of the facts.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.420]   These are not invariable.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.580]   These are variable.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.420]   They may be present, they may not be present.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.220]   But generally in revival you do get something along this line.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.340]   I am hoping later to come back to this and to deal with this point as it becomes the
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:07.500]   focus point of the criticism that is generally leveled against the whole notion of revival.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.660]   I'm simply acquainting you with the facts for the time being.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.060]   Well now then, what meaneth these stones?
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.540]   What mean they, what are they telling us while I've been answering the question?
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.260]   That's the sort of thing that happened a hundred years ago.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.340]   That's the sort of thing that always happens in revival.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.500]   These general features, these variable features.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:34.060]   It is clear therefore that we are being asked to consider this phenomenon which takes place
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.400]   from time to time in the history of the Christian church.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.140]   But come, let me emphasize the second thing.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:49.020]   If those are the facts, what is the real character of the facts?
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.500]   What is the nature of the facts?
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.820]   Well, let's go back to our text.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.700]   Here are people suddenly walking past Gilgal and they see these stones set up and they
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.780]   say, "What mean these stones?"
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.580]   And this is the answer that is to be given.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.460]   The Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you until you were passed over.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.140]   As the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.980]   over, you are to tell them that these are set up that all the people of the earth might
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:28.660]   know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.820]   These stones remind us of facts.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.820]   What sort of facts?
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.100]   Miracles, miraculous facts.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:45.140]   And as that was true of these stones, it is equally true of every revival that has ever
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.540]   taken place.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.340]   A revival is a miracle.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.900]   It is a miraculous, exceptional phenomenon.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:04.300]   It is the hand of the Lord and it is mighty.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.460]   What do I mean by this?
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:14.140]   Well, I mean that a revival is something that can only be explained by the direct action
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.260]   and intervention of God.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.740]   It is God alone that could divide the Red Sea.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.660]   It is God alone that can divide the waters of the river of Jordan.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:31.460]   These were miracles, hence the reminder, God's unique, exceptional action, the mighty acts
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.540]   of God.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.660]   And revivals belong to that category.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.980]   Let me examine this.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:53.300]   These events belong to the order of things that men cannot produce.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   Men cannot produce them.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   Men can produce evangelistic campaigns.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.660]   Men cannot and never have produced a revival.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:09.140]   Oh, they have tried to many times and they are still trying to.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.060]   Alas, Phinney has led the whole church astray at this point by teaching that if you only
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.380]   do certain things you can have a revival whenever you want it.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.620]   The answer is an eternal no.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.500]   And that is not my opinion.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   This is a question of fact.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:31.420]   Haven't we all known and watched and seen men who have been trying to produce revivals?
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.620]   They have introduced all Phinney's methods.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.620]   They have read his book.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.700]   They know it by heart and they have tried to do it.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.820]   They have tried to make people confess their sins.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.180]   They have tried to make them come forward.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.060]   They have done everything that Phinney says should be done.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.260]   And if you do it you get a revival.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:50.100]   They have done it all and they have brought great pressure to bear.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   But there has been no revival.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:02.260]   A revival, by definition, is the mighty act of God.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.580]   And it is a sovereign act of God.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.900]   It is as independent as that.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.980]   Men can do nothing.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.660]   God and God alone does it, set up these stones.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   Why?
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:19.180]   Well, to say that it is the hand of the Lord and that it is mighty.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.620]   The sovereign act of God apart from men.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.780]   And all the details I have just been giving you, you see, fit into this and illustrate
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.900]   that.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:37.260]   But not only can men not produce a revival, they can't even explain it.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.180]   And that is again most important.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:45.020]   I would lay this down as a part of the definition.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.780]   If you can explain what is happening in a church, it isn't revival.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.340]   If you can possibly explain it, it isn't revival.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.280]   You see, that's true of miracles, isn't it?
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.820]   If you can explain a miracle, it's no longer a miracle.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.300]   That's why it's rather pathetic to see people becoming excited when a man publishes a book
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.740]   with the title "The Bible is True".
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.580]   He's going to prove to us now that the miracles of the Old Testament have literally happened.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.900]   And what does he proceed to say?
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.420]   Well, he proceeds, you see, to say this sort of thing happens quite often.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.420]   Did you read that book?
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.860]   There was one illustration.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.400]   I mention it in order to show my point.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.860]   You remember when Moses struck the rock, the water came gushing out.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.160]   "Ah," says this man, "we are now in a very happy position.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.660]   We can really believe this."
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   On what grounds?
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.340]   Well, he said, "During the last war, a number of soldiers in charge of a sergeant were doing
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:40.100]   a bit of work in a given place, and the men were not doing the work to the satisfaction
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   of the sergeant."
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   He said, "Let me have that pick."
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.620]   And he just took hold of it, and accidentally just happened to remove a bit of shale from
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.820]   the side of the hedge, and water began to trickle out.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.100]   He says, "You know, we can believe that when Moses struck the rock, that the water gushed
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   out."
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.300]   See, it happened when the sergeant, who wasn't a Christian at all, just happened accidentally
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.460]   to touch that bit of earth, a little bit of water trickled out.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.380]   And so we can believe in miracles.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.700]   Isn't it rather pathetic?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.100]   If you can explain a thing, it isn't a miracle.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:16.220]   A miracle is the direct, sovereign, immediate, supernatural action of God, and it cannot
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.860]   be explained.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.860]   And that is the essential truth about a revival.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:28.380]   No, no, you can't explain a revival.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.780]   There are no methods used in a revival.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.300]   If methods are used, well, you can understand the result, can't you?
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.940]   You do certain things, you'll get certain results.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.200]   The advertisers know all about that, don't they?
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.540]   You use your methods correctly, you'll get your results, all right.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.700]   People are very gullible, you can make them do almost anything you like.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:55.220]   And we're living in an age of propaganda, an age which is suggestible.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.880]   But there are no methods used in revival at all, none.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.180]   You read the stories.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.780]   No great crowds, no band, no choir, nothing whatsoever, no preliminary advertising, none
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.540]   of these things at all.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.660]   And yet the thing happens.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.580]   So you can't explain it in terms of the methods used, because there are no methods
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.340]   used.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.180]   And then I say again, look at the men who are used.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:30.460]   How often has it been the case in revivals that you've had the sort of reproduction
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.940]   of the kind of thing that we were reading about in the fourth chapter of the book of
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   Acts at the beginning.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.300]   Here was the problem to the religious authorities in Jerusalem.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.260]   Here is a man who was known to everybody, who used to sit every day at the beautiful
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.420]   gate of the temple asking alms of the people.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.500]   A man of forty years of age who'd never walked at all.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.580]   But suddenly this man has been walking and leaping and running into the temple and praising
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.300]   God and everybody knew it.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   And who'd done this?
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.940]   Well, Peter and John.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.940]   Who are these?
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:03.940]   Here's the problem for the authorities.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.380]   Ignorant and unlearned men.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.900]   And yet they said we can't deny but that a notable miracle has happened and everybody
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.580]   knows it.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.060]   And here's the enigma, here's the problem.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.620]   Ignorant and unlearned men.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.580]   Fishermen.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.580]   Is it possible?
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.260]   Can they have done this?
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.660]   They've no learning, they've no training, they've nothing.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.820]   And yet it's happened, what can we do?
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.980]   You see, men can't understand it, they can't explain it.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.100]   The results are not commensurate with the powers implied.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.420]   The answer is it's God who's using these men.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:46.460]   Now I've reminded you that it was like that in 1858 and '59.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:54.060]   And it was like that in 1904 and '05, the last major revival in the British Isles.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.140]   The men whom God used was a man whose name was Evan Roberts, who was a very ordinary
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.900]   man indeed.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.820]   But he was the man whom God used.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.700]   And you can't explain that revival in terms of the man.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.960]   Totally inadequate.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.080]   And then take another argument, look at the change in the men.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.860]   Look at these apostles of whom we've been reading, look at them before Pentecost.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:19.220]   Weak, helpless, look at them after Pentecost.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:25.300]   Filled with a blazing power and with a courage, the Peter who denies his Lord is now facing
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.420]   the hostile crowd and the authorities that have power to put him to death, and he's not
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   afraid of them.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.980]   Look at John Wesley, before May the 24th, 1738.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.180]   A complete failure in the ministry, absolute failure.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180]   Look at him afterwards.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.780]   The same men, with the same abilities, the same powers, the same everything.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.820]   How do you explain that?
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.900]   You can't explain it in terms of Wesley?
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   What is it?
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.220]   What's the spirit of God that has come upon him?
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.780]   It's a miracle you can't understand these things.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:03.100]   And so I say it was a hundred years ago in Northern Ireland and in Wales, I've mentioned
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:08.140]   a man called David Morgan, a very ordinary minister.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.220]   Oh, just carrying on as it were.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.580]   Nobody had heard of him.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.780]   Did nothing at all that was worthy of note.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:22.580]   Suddenly this power comes upon him, and for two years I say he preaches like a lion.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.260]   And then it goes and he reverts to David Morgan again, the same man you see.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.180]   You can't explain it in terms of men.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.540]   There's only one explanation, the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:41.820]   It can take the things that are not and confound the things that are and ridicule.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.220]   Then I say consider the places where it happens.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.140]   May I use the expression, the divine humor.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:58.140]   Where did the revival break out a hundred years ago?
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.900]   It wasn't in the capital city of Belfast in Northern Ireland.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.820]   It was in a village you've never heard of called Conner.
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.740]   That's how God does things.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.500]   When he sent his son into this world, he wasn't born in Jerusalem.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.780]   He was born in Bethlehem, the very least of the cities of Judah.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:22.300]   Thus God, you see, to keep the honor and the glory to himself, makes it impossible that
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.580]   you can explain it in terms of men.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.100]   It's in your Bethlehems, your Conners, your little villages that people have never heard
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.380]   of that the mighty thing happens.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.500]   And it was exactly the same two hundred years ago.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.060]   It was in that little town of Northampton in New England that the revival broke out.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.080]   It was in a little hamlet called Trevecca in Wales that Howell Harris was suddenly laid
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.120]   hold of.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.700]   And in another similar small village that Daniel Rowland was laid hold of.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.700]   Places you've never heard of.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.500]   That's how God does it, not in London, not in the capital cities, but in these unknown
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   places.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   Why?
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.900]   Well, the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.540]   You can't explain it.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   Neither can men in the third place control it.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.940]   You get your sudden beginning.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.500]   You get your sudden ending.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.020]   You get your variations during the revival.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.700]   And men seem to be utterly helpless.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:23.540]   While it is perfectly true to say that we can quench the spirit and be a hindrance,
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:28.100]   it is never true to say that if we observe all the rules and the conditions that we can
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.100]   get revival.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   No, no.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.780]   God keeps it in his own hands, beginning, course, end, everything.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.700]   You're dependent upon the Holy Spirit and his power.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.700]   But lastly, think of its overwhelming character.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.180]   What mean these stones?
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:54.300]   These stones are there to tell us of the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   What is revival?
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.940]   Well, it's something that happens that leads people to say what was said by the townspeople
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.980]   of Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.060]   What is this?
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.540]   What is it?
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.340]   It is something that comes almost like a tornado.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.540]   It's almost like an overflowing tide.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.260]   It's like a flood.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:25.660]   Astounding things happen of such a magnitude that men are left amazed, astonished, astounded.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:32.140]   Let me give you but one illustration, one of the most lyrical and one of the most wonderful.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:39.340]   There was a preacher in Scotland three hundred years ago of the name of John Livingstone,
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:44.100]   of Kilsyth.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.500]   There was a marvellous day in the life of John Livingstone.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.340]   He tells us himself in his autobiography that he was a very ordinary preacher.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.060]   But writing at the end of his life he looks back and he says, "You know, there was a day,
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:03.500]   I shall never forget it, in June 1630.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.660]   He was at a communion service at a place called Shots.
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.020]   Have you ever read of the revival at the Kirk or Shots?
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.580]   Read it, my friends.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   This is what happened.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.580]   They had had their services.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.980]   They had gone on over the weekend.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.900]   John Livingstone and a number of others had been spending Sunday night after the services
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:31.020]   in prayer and in conference, as they called it, talking to one another about these things.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.740]   And Monday morning came and John Livingstone had been asked to preach.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.420]   And he was out in the fields meditating and suddenly he felt that he couldn't preach,
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.280]   that the thing was beyond him, that he was inadequate.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.180]   And he felt like running away.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.980]   But suddenly the voice of God seemed to speak to him, not in audible language but in his
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:52.860]   spirit, telling him that he mustn't do this, that God didn't work in that way.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.580]   And he felt he must go back.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.580]   And he preaches.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:01.140]   He preached, he tells us, on Ezekiel 36.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.820]   And he said, "I preached for about an hour and a half.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.780]   And then," he said, "I began to apply my message."
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:15.520]   And as he was beginning to apply it, suddenly the Spirit of God came upon him.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.380]   And he went on for another hour in this application.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.300]   And as he did so, people were literally falling to the ground.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.900]   In that one service, five hundred people were converted.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.340]   Oh, modern people, I've got to say this, unfortunately, he didn't test the meeting.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.180]   I'm not saying that five hundred came forward at the end.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.980]   They didn't do that sort of thing.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.940]   Five hundred were convicted, some falling to the ground, having to be carried out.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.900]   Others went out groaning in agony and were in this agony for days.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:48.860]   But as a result of that one sermon, five hundred people were added to the churches.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:53.180]   Truly, permanently, soundly converted.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.860]   That's the sort of thing that happens in a revival.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.940]   And poor John Livingston says that that kind of thing only happened to him on one other
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.220]   occasion in a long life, just these two days.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.900]   But what days?
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:14.540]   Not John Livingston, but the hand of the Lord that it is mighty working in and through John
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.540]   Livingston.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:21.100]   I've told you before the story of a man preaching in a little town called Llanidloes in Wales
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.040]   who preached in one sermon.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:30.340]   And during the next six months, a thousand people were added to the churches in the district
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.460]   round about that little town.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   What is this?
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.380]   This is the hand of the Lord that it is mighty.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.380]   At Pentecost you had miracles, speaking with tongues and many other things.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.820]   They are variable.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.140]   They don't always happen.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.980]   You don't get accounts of these in subsequent revivals.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.220]   But mighty things happen.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.500]   Miraculous things happen.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.900]   Things that are beyond the explanation and the wit of men.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:58.420]   And indeed if you consult the men whom God has used on such occasions, they will all
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.300]   tell you the same thing.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:06.220]   They suddenly, like John Livingston, became conscious of a power coming upon them, not
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.220]   themselves.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:13.460]   Taken up, taken out of themselves, given liberty, given authority, given fearlessness, speaking
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:19.540]   as men of God with the boldness of the original apostles.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.460]   They knew when the power came.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.260]   They knew when the power went.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.540]   You will read it in the journals of Whitfield and of Wesley and all the rest.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.400]   This is the hand of the Lord, I say.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.800]   This is the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.100]   It was because he knew so much about this sort of thing that the apostle Paul says,
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:46.380]   "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, through the pulling
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:52.420]   down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:58.260]   against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.260]   of Christ."
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.180]   That's it.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.580]   Or finally, listen to it like this.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:13.540]   Here are the apostles meeting together for prayer in the upper room.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:19.220]   They had been doing it for ten days.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:31.260]   And then, finally, there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing, mighty wind.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:38.740]   And it filled all the house where they were sitting.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.220]   That's it.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:54.060]   But always the sound, but always the consciousness of the mighty wind of God, the Spirit of
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:47:03.340]   God, descending upon preachers, prayers, praying persons, those meeting in conference, the
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:15.580]   sound of a rushing, mighty wind, the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:20.340]   Do we know anything about that, my friends?
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.460]   Do you believe this?
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.900]   Do you believe the facts?
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.940]   Do you believe the explanation?
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:34.420]   Do we who claim to believe in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ still believe in miracles,
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:41.340]   in the possibility of miracles, in God coming in and doing things that we can not only not
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:46.500]   do but cannot even understand, nor control, nor explain?
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:58.460]   Yea, I ask you, do you long to know such things, to see such things happening again today?
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:04.300]   Are you praying for such a visitation?
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:14.260]   For, believe me, when God hears our prayers and does this thing again, it will be such
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:22.900]   a phenomenon that not only will the church be astounded and amazed, but even those who
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:31.060]   are outside will be compelled to listen and to pay attention in a way that they are not
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:37.940]   doing at the present time, and in a way that men left to themselves can never persuade
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.380]   them to do.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.380]   That is the meaning of the stones.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.300]   That is why I am calling your attention to Revival.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.680]   This is what God can do.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.140]   This is what God has done.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:58.340]   Let us together decide to beseech Him, to plead with Him to do this again.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:04.900]   Not that we may have the experience or the excitement, but that His mighty hand may be
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:15.340]   known and His great name may be glorified and magnified amongst the people.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.220]   Amen.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.140]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
