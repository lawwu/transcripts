[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   So today, I want to talk about a curious paradox. Often some of the most interesting,
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.360]   remarkable people that we can think of, the people who seem for many of us to personify
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.480]   the deep life we want to pursue, aren't that busy. So why is this? Because most of us who feel like
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.360]   we have not gotten close to living a remarkable lives are often overwhelmed and busy all the time.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.280]   How is it possible that the people who are most impressive are also often the least busy
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.160]   among the people we know? I want to tackle that paradox today because I think there are
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.440]   some lessons for any of us trying to be more remarkable. So I have three ideas I want to
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   present. The first idea I'm going to actually pull from an article I wrote in 2011. So this is a
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   classic essay from my newsletter blog. It was very popular at the time, but it has a seed that I want
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.040]   to plant here because it's going to help grow into my bigger point. So for those who are watching,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.760]   you will see this on the screen now. And I should say, if you're listening to this podcast,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.240]   this is episode 285. So just go to the deep life.com/listen, find episode 285,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.280]   and you can get the video. All right. So here's the article. It's called,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.360]   if you're busy, you're doing something wrong. The surprisingly relaxed lives of elite achievers.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   Now, this article is getting into what is now a over-cited, over-referenced, over-simplified study
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.800]   from the journal Psychological Review that at the time when I was writing this was still new
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.320]   and still interesting. This was a study where they looked at violin, professional violin players.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.840]   They looked at their training habits. If this sounds familiar, it's because Malcolm Gladwell
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   wrote about it in Outliers. It was one of the canonical examples about the reality of deliberate
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.680]   practice. Deliberate practice being the main way that people get better at demanding skills. They
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.960]   have to practice in a way that's deliberately designed to stretch their abilities past where
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.680]   they're comfortable. So in the study, they're watching how these elite musicians actually
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.800]   practice. All right. So I have a few bolded lines from this article I'm going to read now.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.840]   All right. First line, the time diaries reveal that both groups spent on average the same number
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.040]   of hours on music per week. So this is looking at elite musicians and good, but not elite musicians
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.760]   and comparing them. The elite players were spending almost, I see, the elite players were
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.000]   spending almost three times more hours than the average players on deliberate practice. All right.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.280]   So this is the setup. Average players, elite players practice a lot. The elite players do
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.160]   almost entirely deliberate practice. So that means they're not just playing stuff they already know.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.320]   They're specifically doing exercises to get them better. So they're, for example,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.480]   taking a section of song that they can't quite play full speed and increasing the speed they're
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.840]   practicing at to be a little bit more than where they're comfortable to sort of stretch their
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.280]   ability. All right. The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.760]   The elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two well-defined periods. The
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   elite player slept an hour more per night than the average players. The elite players were
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.120]   significantly more relaxed than the average players. So this is interesting. The elite
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   players do really hard practice, but not, they don't do the other stuff. They also don't practice
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.800]   all day. They consolidate their practice into two concentrated chunks. And outside of that practice,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.960]   they were more relaxed and had more sleep than the average players. So I'm going to read here
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   my summary. So I said, this provides, this study provides, empirical evidence that there's a
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.520]   difference between hard work and hard to do work. Hard work is deliberate practice. It's not fun
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.600]   while you're doing it, but you don't have to do too much of it in any one given day.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.560]   Hard to do work, by contrast, is draining. It has you running around all day in a state of false
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.840]   busyness that leaves you just like the average players from the study, feeling tired and
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.680]   stressed. I then conclude if your goal is to build a remarkable life, then busyness and exhaustion
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.800]   should be your enemy. All right. So this is really interesting. Like what we're finding here is this
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   idea that what it takes to get good at something, really good at something is hard, but not hard to
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.840]   do. It's hard in the moment, but there's only so much of it you can do per day. And what happens
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.360]   with the rest of your time is irrelevant to whether you become really good. The three to four
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.040]   hours that these professional musicians practice every day, that's it. That's what's important for
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.160]   them. There's not more they can do. That's about the limit. So the rest of that day is free.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.240]   So getting good, getting really good can be unrelated to being busy. And at the highest
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.720]   levels, like these elite musicians, busyness actually gets in the way of getting good
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.440]   because it distracts you from the practice activities that matter. It exhausts you and
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   takes away energy that you could later put into the actual activities that are going to make you
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.760]   better. All right. So what's my second idea here? Building on that, I'm going to say rare skills
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.160]   fuel remarkability. So what I mean by that is, OK, why get really good at something?
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.680]   Well, getting really good at something gives you leverage over your professional life.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.200]   It gives you options and opportunities. It is the primary fuel you have for crafting your life to be
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   more remarkable. And my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which actually came out
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.440]   soon after that article we just read, right? So these ideas are actually replicated in my book,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.200]   So Good They Can't Ignore You. In that book, I introduced this term called career capital
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:44.320]   that captures this reality. So career capital is a metaphorical substance that captures your rare
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   and valuable skills. The more rare and valuable skills you have, the more career capital you have.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.560]   Your career capital is what you invest into your working life to make it better.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   The more career capital you have, the more investments you can make into taking control
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   of your life, where you live, how much you work, the impact of your work, the conditions under
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.240]   which you work, the pace and rhythm of what you work, the specific projects you work on or not.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.880]   The better you are at something, the more control you have over that. The more ability you have to
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.520]   craft those type of professional lives that seem to the outside world to be quite remarkable.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.680]   So as you get better at something, you get more options to make your life remarkable.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.520]   Not to make more money, not necessarily just to be straight up more successful,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.680]   but more remarkable. So idea three is to put these two things together. Let's follow this
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.560]   syllogism through to its conclusion. So if rare and valuable skills doesn't require busyness
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:50.000]   to develop, but rare and valuable skills fuel remarkability, we put those together and we get
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.840]   remarkable lives don't require busyness. A implies B, B implies C, A implies C.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.440]   Little propositional logic there for discrete mathematics fans.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.800]   This then is why we see people whose lives often hit us remarkable aren't busy,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.200]   because the core of that remarkability is their rare and valuable skills. And actually,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.560]   busyness is orthogonal. Use some linear algebra here, as long as we're using math terms,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.600]   is orthogonal to busyness. Busyness is not needed to get good, and it can even get in the way.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.760]   Right? So this seems like a pretty interesting connection. You don't need busyness to have
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.400]   remarkable life. The problem is, however, there's two traps that are lurking here.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.800]   So we can think of this as our fourth idea. There's two traps here that are lurking.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.360]   All right. One, as you get better at things, you will be given more interesting opportunities
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.920]   that will bring with them the requirement that you become more busy. There's a trap here,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.640]   a great remarkability. I got to get that by being good at things. But as you get good at things,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.520]   a lot of outside forces will try to hijack your life from your streamlined
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.360]   platonic remarkability that you had in mind. An example I think about here sometimes is the
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.800]   YouTuber and engineer Mark Rober, who, if you don't know, because maybe you don't have kids
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.600]   of a certain age, he does these really elaborate engineering-based projects and then does very
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.080]   catchy YouTube videos about it. This is the guy that built those glitter bombs that catch porch
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.960]   pirates. You steal the box off the porch, and he had all these elaborate traps built into them.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.440]   And he's done a lot of other things. They do these engineering videos.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.000]   One of the things I've noticed is as he got more successful, so his YouTube channel is very big,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.960]   he became friends with the host of ABC's late night show. I'm blanking on that name.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.240]   Who is that, Jesse, from way back when he was on The Man Show?
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.640]   Hey, quick interruption. If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.160]   the deep life, go to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.520]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on the show.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.760]   All right, let's get back to it. Well, whatever.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.680]   Yeah, I'll look it up. Yeah, look it up. Okay. But anyways, he became friends with him.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.240]   Uh, and kept going on to, I'm going to recognize this name so hard when you say it,
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.160]   we're not going to get invited on his show, ABC late night show.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   I'm doing it right now. Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.760]   Jimmy Kimmel. Yeah, I know that. All right. Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.800]   Uh, so he started going on Jimmy Kimmel show, uh, and got really successful.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.240]   It seems to me that Mark Rober, who was doing really well with these videos,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.840]   you can just crunch the numbers because the overhead was low. It would take three months
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.680]   to make one of these videos. Uh, but it would be like him and his brother typically.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.240]   And then you could calculate the money he was making on the 20, 30 million views or whatever.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.600]   He's doing very well. Right. He got busier and I don't know this for a fact. I don't know anything
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.360]   about him, but you know, he, he bought this big warehouse space for filming fine. Um,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.840]   but then he launched a, a pro a company, a subscription box company, which is a cool
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.480]   company. My kids do it crunch box where, you know, you get the box of stuff and build it,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   but that's a really time consuming thing to do is to run a company that sells a physical
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.400]   product that has to be boxed and sent out. And then he signed this deal with max HBO max
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.360]   to do all these shows for them. I mean, it just seems like his life is very, very busy now
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:37.440]   in a way where just five years ago, it's like, I bake these videos, it's me and my brother.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.680]   And like someone edits them and I do really well. And I can focus on what's really good
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.640]   because opportunities arise. Hey, we can build this company. You can do shows on this network.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:53.200]   Opportunities arise as you get better, which can pull you away from a really remarkable life and
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.560]   into just a more standard, like very successful, but probably very busy life. The other trap
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:08.640]   is that as you get better, you get opportunities for a larger and more time consuming instantiations
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.600]   of the thing you're doing. So even if you are careful to avoid the Mark Rober trap of,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.240]   let me add this company and add another, I can do TV. In addition to videos,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.720]   even if you avoid that trap, as you get better, the time required to do things,
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   the things you've always been doing, uh, can also get up, could also go up.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.520]   So we see this it's Oscar season. We see this with directors. I think about like Greta Gerwig,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.160]   how much more time was involved trying to direct Barbie versus probably like Francis Ha.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   Just because of the scope, the giant, uh, sets and all the actors and everything that was involved
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.440]   in it and the marketing that's involved in that she's doing the same thing, making really good
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   movies. But now it takes a lot more time or Chris Nolan and Oppenheimer versus Chris Nolan with a
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.800]   crew of four making memento. They're doing the same thing, but as you get better, the stakes
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.720]   increase. I mean, even my own life is like this. What goes into me publishing a book today
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.880]   is way more time consuming than what it was when I was publishing, you know, even so good,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.000]   they can't ignore you. And certainly my student books where I was like, yeah,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.160]   I'll do a few interviews when it comes out. Hey, books out. All right, back to work.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.800]   I don't like that anymore. It's months of months of stuff because I got better at what I was doing.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   So I didn't change what I'm doing, but the size and therefore busyness induced by the standard
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.920]   thing you've always been doing gets bigger as you get, as you get better. So how do we avoid those
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   traps if we don't want to be busy? We want to be remarkable, but not busy. The first trap, I think
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:51.360]   you just have to try to avoid it or be really, really open about the trade-off you're making.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:59.680]   I think we should just have more willingness as a more willingness to say, I know I could do that
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.080]   show on HBO, but I'm not like this is working well. I just want to keep doing this. Well,
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.000]   that should be an option. That's more on the table. A more sophisticated hack you can do here
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.720]   is like, okay, maybe an opportunity arises. You want to explore, give it a tight time gate. I'm
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.840]   going to stay within these time bounds on this so I can explore something without it taking over
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.080]   my life. I think this is the way I think about the new media aspects of what I do. I thought
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.520]   podcasting, for example, and everything that surrounds it, I was like, this, this is important.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.000]   I think this is the way to talk to an audience. But what I've done, and Jesse can attest to this,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.280]   is I have a half day limit. I spend a half day a week. It has to live in there. That's where
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.960]   all this stuff has to live in a half day a week to show we actually do. If we want to add something
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.920]   new to it, either I have to make time for it or find someone who can do that for us. We released
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.800]   this on YouTube now, but I wasn't going to spend a lot more time for that. We had to find a good
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.560]   partner and figure out how we were going to do this. That's the other way you can do it. I do
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:10.480]   have to expand some. Let me put very careful boxes around where that exploration happens. It's going
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.240]   to stay in there. For the second trap, that's unavoidable. As you get better at things,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.840]   you're going to have opportunities to do it at a bigger scale. It's going to take more time.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.880]   Greta Gerwig is happy that she gets to do Barbie in part because I think she had good profit
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   participation and the movie did 1.5 billion. She's probably very happy about that. That's harder to
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.240]   avoid, but you have to be really careful about it. I'm going to pull an idea out of my book,
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.120]   Slow Productivity, here. You have to have real variations in intensity. Movie directors do this
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.080]   very well. All right, I'm working on my big movie. There's going to be an eight-month period where
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.640]   it's just all in, but the eight months that follow everything being done, I'm doing nothing.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.360]   I'm just sitting and thinking and trying to figure out what I want to do next.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.680]   We see that with creatives like movie directors. It's very intense when they're working on a movie,
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.160]   but they'll also take a lot of time off. Chris Nolan worked really hard on Oppenheimer,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   but also he doesn't have a smartphone and doesn't use email. He's like, "Okay,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.120]   I'll do this hard thing, but it's really the only hard thing I do. Then I can take a complete break
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.320]   from that before I work on my next project." This natural variation in intensity, that's an idea
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.520]   for my book, Slow Productivity. That's a way of dealing with, as you get better and your projects
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   get harder, you also at that same point have the leverage to say, "Great, but then I'm going to
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.280]   take time off after this," or, "I'm not going to do anything else unrelated, so I could just do
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.480]   this one really hard thing as well as I can." All right, so there's our paradox. That's the
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.600]   explanation. Why do people with remarkable lives sometimes seem less busy than us? Because
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.720]   busyness is unrelated and sometimes even an obstacle to being really good, and being really
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   good is where remarkability almost always comes from. If you find yourself adding more and more
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:05.120]   onto your plate in the pursuit of a remarkable life, you're doing it wrong. If you're busy,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.280]   there could be other psychological advantages to that, but you're not deploying a useful strategy
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.840]   for building a remarkable life. Remarkability is not something that alchemizes from an abundance
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:26.240]   of action. It's something that is instead crafted by the main tool of skill, and skill and busyness
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.280]   do not play well together. So that's how we can separate those two things.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:39.840]   Just see, I have this phantom article on this topic that is referenced in the very earliest
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.120]   essays I ever wrote for my newsletter and blog, but I can't find the actual article.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:52.240]   So I know at some point I wrote this thing called The Paradox of the Relaxed Road Scholar,
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.200]   and it was back when I was writing student books. It was about this idea that road scholars,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.520]   who you have to be very accomplished, are often way more relaxed than the average student on the
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   dean's list, and it's because to do something really impressive, impressive enough to become
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.960]   a road scholar, you have to be really good at something which really requires a focus,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   and so they're not busy in the way that other people are. I can't find the article. In fact,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.440]   I can find... It's like the third or fourth post at the very beginning of my blog says,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:29.200]   "As we discussed last week in The Paradox of the Relaxed Road Scholar," and it references
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.880]   case studies, like Daniel, Acosta, blah, blah, blah. I can't find it. I don't know where the
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.520]   article is. It's like disappeared into the gaps of the internet, or maybe I emailed it
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:49.440]   but never added it to the blog, and I don't know, but it's lost. It exists out there somewhere.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.800]   I'm sure a fan will find it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.440]   I still remember that phrase, though, The Paradox of the Relaxed Road Scholar. It's a phrase I use
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.120]   all the time, but I can't find... There's nothing for me to cite there. All right, anyways, that's
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   all we have for our deep dive. I want to move on here to questions, but before we do, let's talk
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.840]   about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible. Let's start with our friends, a new
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.520]   sponsor and one I'm excited about, our friends at Maui Nui Venison. That's Maui from Hawaii,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:28.720]   N-U-I, Maui Nui Venison. I was just talking to them the other day. This is a really cool idea.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:35.040]   So here's basically... Here's the whole story. On the island of Maui in Hawaii, they have this
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.280]   invasive species of deer, the Axis deer. There's too many of them, and they're eating all of the
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.640]   vegetation. This is causing all sorts of problems. It's deforesting the vegetation, which is causing
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.520]   topsoil to wear off. It's pushing native animals out of their habitats. It's also preventing the
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.480]   groundwater tables from rising naturally because the water without the vegetation is pouring off.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.000]   It's a big problem. Hawaiian government is trying to get rid of as many Axis deer as possible.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.880]   At the same time, these Axis deer are delicious because not only are they wild, but they're eating
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:13.440]   a variety of Hawaiian plants all day long. So it's this really varied vegetation diet that makes the
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:20.480]   meat really, really good. So Maui Nui Venison, what they do is they harvest through hunting
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.000]   these invasive Axis deer that need to be culled anyways. And instead of just throwing away the
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:35.520]   the the bodies, they are taking the meat and making really good venison in jerky form as well
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.840]   as in ground form and as well as in steak form. It's fantastic. They sent me a box. I actually
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:48.240]   just ate one of the jerky sticks on the way over here just to get my energy up. It's very healthy.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   They have all these tests. I mean, it's very healthy red meat, very low fat, you know, like
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   ground meat from the supermarket is 20 percent fat. Typically ground meat from these venison,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.040]   it's one percent or less. A huge amount of protein. It's just like the healthiest red
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.320]   meat you're going to eat. And it's sustainable. It's part of actually helping this Maui ecosystem
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.800]   recover. It's so sustainable that the guy I was talking to was telling me they have a lot of
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.920]   vegans that said ethical vegans who said, oh, I can eat meat again because this meat actually,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.160]   from an ethical perspective, makes sense. Low stress lives, low stress deaths, and,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.800]   you know, carefully well done rendered. They're giving a lot of this meat back, by the way,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.280]   to residents of Maui, the wild who have been their homes destroyed by the wildfires. It's wildfires,
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   rather, which I think is really cool. There's like some large percent they just have in these
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.440]   public freezers for people in Maui to eat. Anyways, really cool company, fantastic food,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.000]   great for you. Tastes great. And what you do is it's a subscription service and you can subscribe
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.680]   to get these boxes. So, you know, we just ship it to you in bulk and you get these boxes with a
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:06.720]   variety of the product. And you can get this at Mauinuivenison.com/deepquestions and use the

[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.720]   out of stock when you go to the website, just keep a careful eye on it. They're increasing capacity,
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.400]   and this is fantastic and it's worth waiting for. So that's Mauinuivenison.com/deepquestions
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:56.880]   to get 20 percent off. We also want to talk about our sponsor, MOSH, M-O-S-H.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.960]   So here's the thing. As I get older, I don't really always need the big three square meals,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.040]   especially if I'm on the go and drink a lot of coffee. Sometimes I need just a little bit of a
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   gap bridger. And when I do that, I like to eat MOSH bars as a quick way just to give me a little
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:22.400]   bit more energy in between other things that I have going on. It's a high protein snack that I
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.440]   can feel good actually eating, and it tastes great. The company was founded by Maria Shriver
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.960]   and her son, Patrick Schwarzenegger, should sound familiar, with a simple mission to create a
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.400]   conversation about brain health through food, education, and research. This was inspired in
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:45.760]   part by Maria's father's long bout with Alzheimer's. So they've really thought a lot about brain health.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:52.560]   Each MOSH bar has 12 grams of protein and is made with ingredients that support brain health like
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.720]   ashwagandha, lion's mane collagen, and omega-3s. They also have a line of plant-based protein bars
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.320]   if that is what you're looking for. They taste really good. Tastes really good. I go through
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.800]   these boxes fast because it's high protein, good ingredients. I eat one of these and it holds me
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:18.960]   over until whatever I'm working on next. And I like that there's a mission behind it that Maria
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.120]   and Patrick have a reason why they're interested in this topic. MOSH donates a portion of all
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.800]   proceeds with that in mind towards gender-based brain health research through the women's Alzheimer
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   movement. Why women's in particular? Because two-thirds of Alzheimer's patients are women.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.360]   So it's working among other things to help close the gap between women and men's health research
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:47.520]   on this topic. So if you want to find ways to give back to others and fuel your body and your brain,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:55.040]   MOSH bars are the perfect choice for you. Head to moshlife.com/deep to save 20% off

[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.200]   All right, Jesse, I think it's time to do some questions.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   Sounds good. First question's from A World Without Baseball. Good name. I really, well,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.520]   depending on how you look at it. I like this name. I really like a lot of the parts of your
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.120]   productivity system, the time block daily plan, the quarterly plan, the core values and Trello.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.520]   I am confused about the weekly plan. How does this interact with other parts of your system?
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.520]   Well, I'm hoping A World Without Baseball is wistful, right? Like we're temporarily in A World
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   Without Baseball because it's the off season. If he's promoting A World Without Baseball as a good
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.200]   thing, well, then we got other problems, my friend. Got other problems. All right. Good question.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:04.960]   People ask a lot about the weekly plan and how it fits into my multi-planning methodology. So
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.560]   let's talk about that briefly. A quick plug, by the way, in the final segment of this episode,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.320]   I'm going to be talking about a new article of mine where I go into detail and multi-scale
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.360]   planning. So, you know, stay tuned for that for a deeper dive, but let's just get specific here.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.440]   So what does a weekly plan do? Well, you build it every week,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.600]   probably on Monday or maybe at Friday before the week is done. When you build your weekly plan,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   you reference at a higher scale, your strategic plan, your plan that you update once every
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.720]   quarter or season with your bigger goals at that timescale. So when you build your weekly plan,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:48.080]   you want to look up a scale and say, what are the big projects that I'm working on
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.280]   this quarter or season? Then you want to look at your calendar for the week ahead and say, okay,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:01.440]   where is there time for me to make effort on these big objectives that aren't reflected by an urgent
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.040]   email, or there's no one pushing me to do it. And you look to find time. I suggest you probably want
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.440]   to actually block off some of the time you find for working on these big objectives,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.280]   add it to your calendar, like any other meeting or appointment. So it's protected and it gets done.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.320]   This is also a time when you can rearrange your calendar. This is the
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.920]   hidden magic of weekly planning is you look at your calendar and you realize, man,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.960]   all these days have just enough stuff that I can't really make progress on this big project.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.200]   But if I look at Tuesday, the first thing is optional. I could cancel that. And the second
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.280]   thing I could move to be right after this meeting on Thursday, because it's with the same people.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.200]   And if I do that, I free up four hours and now I can make progress on the technical report I'm
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.080]   writing. It's part of the magic of weekly planning is not just finding time for big objectives,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   but also making time for big objectives. And you'll never do this if you're just reactive.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.720]   Hey, what do I need to work on next? Let me look at my inbox and calendar. Oh,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.840]   there's another meeting, right? You're never going to free up that time if you're just going
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.800]   moment to moment. The final thing you can do during weekly planning is look at your task systems,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:15.680]   remind yourself of what's important. This is a good time during your weekly planning to update
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.960]   and clean up your task systems. If you use a structured system, like I recommend with roles
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.320]   and statuses, you can move things around. OK, I'm not this I heard back from. Let me move that. Let
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.280]   me clarify this. You're kind of cleaning up your your task system and identifying if there's any
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.800]   really important tasks that definitely need to get done. I'll often write a reminder about those
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:44.000]   in my weekly plan. So I'll go back to my task system just during a normal task block just to
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.400]   knock off a bunch of stuff. But if there's a few big things in that system that are really important,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.200]   I'll jot it down. I might even find time on my calendar when I'm going to do those specific
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.000]   tasks and protect it in advance. So you can work with your task system as well.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.680]   So you look up to your strategic plan, reflect those objectives into your weekly into your week,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.480]   moving things if needed. Then you look, I guess we could say sideways to your task system and
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.320]   clean that up and see what are your priorities and make sure that you've made a note of that
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.880]   somewhere. Now you're ready to tackle your week. Weekly plans. So your task systems, your Trello.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:28.000]   For me, it's Trello. Yeah. One board per role, one column per status. And people ask like, oh,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   so are the tasks leaving your task system and going out your weekly plan? No, they live in
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.520]   your task system. You can remind yourself in your weekly plan. You can actually schedule time for a
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.760]   task on your calendar for the week. But think of that as a reminder as well. It lives in your task
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.200]   system until done and then you remove it. All right. What do we got next? Next question is
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.360]   from Mario. What counts as work in fixed schedule productivity? Does it include errands like getting
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.560]   groceries and going to the pharmacy? Does it include mentally demanding things, but not related
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.120]   to your job, such as reading books? Well, just as a reminder, fixed schedule productivity is the
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.000]   meta productivity strategy where you fix in advance. These are the hours I'm going to work.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.160]   And then you do whatever you need to, to make your work fit into there.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.840]   Now, I call it a meta productivity strategy because it's going to force you to innovate
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.360]   different strategies for how you agree to work and schedule work and how efficiently you tackle work
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.000]   because you have this back pressure coming from the need to fit all your work into a given
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:42.560]   constraint. I was thinking about a variation on this, but I'm not going to go there right now.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.600]   Let's keep this simple. So let's just summarize. You fix the time in advance and you work backwards
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.160]   to do whatever you can to make your work fit. So you'll invent a lot of tactics for how you do that
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.440]   and also just forces you to be more reasonable about how many things you have on your plate at
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.680]   the same time, because it has to fit. It's really a good strategy because of
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:09.040]   the Parkinson's law style effect of schedules. In an age where work is always available because
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.840]   of mobile computing, your phone, your laptop, your tablet, and there's always more work to do,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.520]   right? There's a new email, a new idea, a new request. There's always something to do.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:24.480]   Work can fill any space that you give it. So especially in today's world, it's not a bad
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.720]   idea to say, "This is when I want to work. How do I work backwards and be successful within those
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.880]   constraints?" And you'd be surprised by how effective you can be without having to work
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.040]   a huge amount of hours. So Mario is asking, "What about non-professional tasks like errands,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.520]   going to the grocery store, going to the pharmacy, or things like reading?"
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.120]   Fixed-scale productivity is work hours. That's what it's for. This is when I'm working. I don't
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.720]   work beyond there. So it has nothing to say about what you do outside of work. That's a different
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:01.760]   type of thinking. If you want to do a non-professional task during your fixed schedule
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.720]   hours, well, it's just taking some of the time, right? So that's just less time you have to get
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.880]   the work done, but that schedule doesn't shift. So if you say, "Look, I work from nine to four
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.920]   and I have to make it fit. So I got to triage things and have systems for checking with clients
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.600]   so they don't expect to call at five or whatever." You can go to the grocery store in the middle of
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.160]   that, but you still only have 10 to four to get your work done. So it just depends on how you
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.400]   want to do that. One thing I used to do when I had a dog and I was a postdoc is my fixed schedule
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.760]   was in two blocks. And I had a midday portion where I didn't work. I would go for a run with
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.560]   my dog and do some errands. So that's one thing you might do here is a fixed schedule doesn't
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:49.120]   have to be one big block of time. It can be block, unblocked, block, and then you can move more of
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.000]   the non-professional stuff in between those blocks. But the basic idea is simple. This is the
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.960]   time when I work, I don't work beyond it. That's the non-negotiable that you're starting with.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:06.400]   All right, who do we got next? Next question's from Amit. "With respect to slow productivity,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.960]   should I, as a grad student, perform my limited amount of tasks sequentially or spend every day
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.640]   doing new research for a couple hours? My tasks include managing my time between new research,
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.320]   paper reviews, and coursework." The things that are most important you want to do most often.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:29.040]   So as a grad student, assuming you're a doctoral student, your research is the most important thing
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   you do. So you should work on it regularly. All the other stuff you figure out how to spread out
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:42.880]   on the time that remains. So that might mean for you, nine to noon, that's research. And then noon
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.240]   to four is like the other stuff, coursework, paper reviews, administrative stuff. And you
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.880]   kind of figure that out and rotate through and you do one thing one day and nothing another day,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.720]   however you want to do that. But the research always gets done. It's like me with my writing.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   I just always write. I don't say, okay, I'm going to write till I'm done. And now I'm going to work
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.040]   on a course. Now when I'm done doing that, I'm going to work on a research paper. I'm just always
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.880]   writing. That's the non-negotiable because it's the core engine of what I do best. And then I
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.600]   make the other stuff fit however I need to in the time that remains. So as a grad student, I mean,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:24.080]   research every day. That'd be my recommendation. - So your weekly plan has just writing daily on it?
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.720]   - Yeah. If I'm writing a book, it's basically every day. Yeah. And even if I'm not because
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.200]   of my New Yorker tempo, it usually is non-teaching days. I'm just writing. And on those days as well,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.400]   sometimes as well. Yeah. So some stuff can be sequential. The core stuff you should do
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.320]   as much as possible. All right. Who have we got next? - Next question is from Lisa.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:52.080]   With slow productivity, how do I gauge if I'm doing enough on a short-term scale?
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.240]   Business and exhaustion are no longer markers of productivity. If anything,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.320]   they indicate the opposite. But I don't have enough experience and success with a slow
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.480]   productivity approach to trust that my quarterly plan is good and on track.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.360]   - All right, Jesse, I'm thinking we should name this question
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.880]   our slow productivity corner question of the week.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:24.160]   So we want to make sure at least one question a week is related to my new book, Slow Productivity.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   Find out more about the book, read an excerpt, get a bunch of pre-order bonuses at
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   calnewport.com/slow. All right. Good question here. Lisa wants to know if I'm not using
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   busyness and exhaustion as my marker of doing enough, how do I know if what I'm doing is good?
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.440]   This question is important for two reasons. One, the specifics of my answer, but two,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.480]   the setup. One of the core ideas in my book is a look at how we currently implicitly think about
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.840]   productivity in the knowledge work space. And what we do now, even if we don't know
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.720]   this terminology, what we do now is we embrace a concept I call pseudo productivity.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.760]   Pseudo productivity is exactly what Lisa mentions here. It's the idea that we should use visible
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:23.040]   activity as a proxy for useful effort. The more you're doing, the more useful you are.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.960]   Now, this isn't an accurate measure of the value you're producing, but it's like a reasonable
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.480]   heuristic that we fall back on. More is better than less. Activity is better than non-activity.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.680]   So how do you as a knowledge worker, therefore, feel like you're doing all you can for your
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.760]   organization? Because you're busy all the time. You're doing a lot of activity to the point where
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.160]   it feels like too much. And then you get some sort of psychological piece of, well, at least I'm not
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:54.000]   slacking off. Now, I think it's a terrible way to actually manage work because A, busyness can
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.280]   be completely unrelated from producing stuff that matters. And B, in an age of ubiquitous wireless
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.800]   internet and mobile computing, there's never any end to how much work you can do and when you can
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.240]   do it. So the footprint of work in the pseudo productivity regime combined with modern
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.360]   technology, the footprint is unending. You always feel guilty when you're not working.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.040]   You're always going to do more work than you should be doing. You always are going to be in
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.200]   the zero sum internal tug of war between the demands of pseudo productivity and the demands
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.720]   of being a human. And it's a terrible internal turmoil that we're all quietly suffering through
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.400]   because we have this insufferable definition of productivity. So slow productivity says,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.480]   forget that. Pseudo productivity does not work anymore. That's not how we should measure it.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.800]   Here's an alternative way of thinking about producing great stuff in a way that doesn't
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.480]   burn you out. Do fewer things, work at a natural pace, obsess over quality.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.960]   So then Lisa says, okay, but this is hard. Psychologically, this is hard
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.600]   because if I am going to be doing fewer things and I can't fall back on stress
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.520]   as a way to assuage my fear that I'm being lazy, what do I do with that anxiety?
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.320]   And partially, Lisa, I'm going to say, sit with it for a little bit.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:18.000]   Do this for a couple of quarters and you'll get that feedback. Oh, I'm doing fine. Yeah,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.680]   I'm doing fewer things, following the systems I talk about in my book, which allows you to do
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.200]   that without blowing up your job or walking into your boss's office and saying, I quite quit.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:33.120]   No, it's way more nuanced than that, way more subtle than that. But you can, if you're careful
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.360]   about it, drastically reduce how much you're working on. And if you follow my advice properly,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.040]   as laid out in the book, you're going to get more stuff done. This is the thing that people
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.800]   miss. When you have a lot of things on your plate, it generates busyness very well.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.920]   It doesn't generate productive output very well because you spend more and more of your time
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.240]   servicing the administrative and overhead needs of these obligations. That takes away time from
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:01.440]   actually producing the stuff that matters. So having fewer things on your plate,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.760]   you move through those things at a faster rate so that the total number of things you accomplish in
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.880]   a given quarter is actually more than when you were "busier." But it's going to take a quarter
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.240]   or two before you believe that. So just take that quarter or two. What's the worst that could
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.440]   happen? You feel a little anxious, like, am I doing enough? Just sit with that. Don't try to
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.800]   assuage that anxiety by being busy again. If you're really miscalibrating and you're not doing enough,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.160]   OK, so you had a quarter where you didn't really do as much as you should, and now you're going to
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.960]   have to adjust. That's not a bad thing. That's basically like a little vacation you probably
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.360]   needed anyways. Nothing terrible is going to happen. People are busy. Don't be negligent.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.800]   Don't be unreliable. But no one's going to really notice. So just sit with the anxiety.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:54.320]   Don't let it push you into overwork. Give it a quarter. Give it two. And you're saying, OK,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.440]   this is working. I'm impressing my boss. I'm getting really good stuff done. I'm no longer
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.480]   stressed out. This slow productivity thing, there's something to it. So it's OK to be anxious.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.720]   But sit with it. Don't let it push you into too much overwork.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.640]   All right. I think that was a pretty good slow productivity corner.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.400]   Now, of course, as we talk about this topic more, we have more and more questions about it. So it's
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.680]   no longer this is the only question. But we choose one question per episode to actually get the theme
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.160]   music, even if we have more than one question about the topic of slow productivity. Speaking
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.200]   of which, what's our last question here, Jesse? OK, last question is from Brian. Do you think a
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.160]   smart and committed young knowledge worker can succeed with a slow productivity approach
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.040]   if they're not also notching up bigger short-term wins along the way? Could you have? In prior
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.320]   episodes, you talked about your conquer the world mindset of your younger years.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:59.200]   Was that needed to be where you're at today? Well, Brian, it's a good question. First of all,
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:05.440]   though, I'm going to reject the premise of bigger short-term wins along the way.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:13.840]   If a win is short term, something you can produce in a non-slow productivity approach, so just by
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.080]   lots of activity, it's not that big of a win. How impressive can it be if it didn't require
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.440]   the long development of a rare and valuable skill? So I think what you're counting as
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:36.000]   bigger short-term wins is more like the effluvia of busyness. I don't know. I'm on
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.800]   Instagram and emails and this and that and doing these conferences and jumping over here.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   It's that sort of short-term feeling of like I'm doing stuff and getting these sort of pseudo
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.520]   recognitions and serendipitous moments of virality. But none of that really aggregates
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:56.320]   to anything all that impressive. There are no short-term big wins outside of the lottery.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:05.840]   Big wins require time. They require long term. So you're not missing out on anything deeply
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.720]   important if you're spending your 20s focused relentlessly on getting good at something really
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.480]   valuable. Now, you talked about my conquer the world mindset from my younger years, which I did
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:23.600]   have. But here's the thing. I did achieve a lot of my vision of conquering the world, right?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:31.920]   A lot of that was so academically speaking, it was I want to get a professorship at a good
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.280]   university and get tenured early, like be a tenured professor and publish good stuff in my field.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:44.480]   And from a writing perspective, I wanted big idea books. I always just say to my agent,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.400]   I want a hardcover idea book, like the ones I love, not just the student guides I'm writing now.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.040]   And I wanted them to be important and sell a lot of copies. And my other dream, and my agent will
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.960]   tell you this, early on in my career was I wanted to write for the New Yorker. I want to be also
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.200]   just like writing stuff that requires real craft. And I accomplished all those things, right?
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:10.480]   I got tenured early after just four years and got a good professorship. My books are
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.120]   very successful, right? And millions of copies, 40, 45 languages. And I write for the New Yorker.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.440]   Here's the thing, though. All of that happened in my 30s.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:26.080]   My mindset was in the 20s. That's when I hatched this vision. All this stuff happened in the 30s.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:34.560]   Most of it happening in my mid-30s to 40. That whole period in my 20s, I was relentlessly working
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.480]   on being a better computer scientist and a better writer. That's what I was doing. And I wasn't
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.600]   doing social media, and I wasn't launching companies, and I wasn't giving a lot of talks,
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.360]   and I wasn't trying to create conferences, and I wasn't traveling a lot. I had a lot of friends
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.280]   who were into that back then. It was like, you should have a travel budget and go to five or
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.360]   six of these conferences they used to hold every year so you could just meet interesting people.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.200]   I didn't do any of that. Write, write, better writer, better writer. Each book was done,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.800]   how do I make the next one better? How do I get better? How do I become a better researcher? Let
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.240]   me write a better paper. Let's go. Let me get that H index up. Let me get those publications up.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.480]   Once I had my professorship, how do I win an award? How do I get those papers better? Let's
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.760]   push, push, push. Very focused. I stayed focused on those same two things for well over a decade.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.240]   And then I began conquering the world that I had in mind.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:31.760]   So your 20s are an exciting period if you want a remarkable life, but they're exciting not because
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.040]   you're likely to unlock the remarkability and reap its benefits while still in the 20s. Your 20s is
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.760]   your time where you focus on your craft. Your 20s are your time where the most important thing you
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   can do is say no. They're the time when the key is coming back to your core pursuit again and again,
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:57.440]   even as really shiny objects are hung in front of you. Like, nope, nope, nope. It's boring. I'm
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:04.400]   just coming back. And there's frustration involved and you get impatient. But then when you end up
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.440]   conquering your definition of the world later on, that's when all of that seems worth it.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.800]   And the scale of those goals, like for me to be like the tenured professor with the awards and
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.640]   the books and the New York or whatever, there's nothing I could have done in my 20s. No, quote,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.400]   unquote, big short-term win that would have aggregated to anything like that. It would have
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.000]   been a lot of nonsense. I gave this show, I did this, and I had this video thing, and I did this,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.520]   but like all these little things that in the moment would have felt busy and would have added
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.840]   to nothing now that I'm 41. So I think slow productivity is the cool way to go. It's also
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:45.120]   psychologically more sustainable. That's a much more healthy 20, psychologically speaking,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.240]   for someone who's ambitious and talented to just be focusing on craft for a while and not having
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.680]   to be like out there in the public eye or trying to, why is this thing not working? Why I'm trying
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.320]   to land this or whatever. I mean, it's kind of nice to just get to know yourself as an adult
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.960]   and build your skills. And so I wouldn't worry, Brian, slow productivity all the way. All right,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.200]   Jesse, let's do an actual call. Sounds good. We've got Warren. Warren, all right.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   Hi, Cal. Love to pop. I'm a professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and I share episodes
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:23.520]   with my students pretty often. So here's my question and situation. I'm pretty well organized
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.800]   already, especially at work. I've got a tiered system of planning. It includes a Gantt chart
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.640]   for annual high-level planning, a few Trello boards for implementing my plan, and a daily
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:41.600]   task and time boxing system for my rather busy job. But the best laid plans of mice and men go
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.680]   off the rye and leave us nothing but grief and pain. To wit, I find myself often looking back
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.400]   at a week, month, or quarter, and anxiously realizing that my well-organized system wasn't
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.840]   well-executed at all. So my question for you is, do you have any thoughts or recommendations
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.600]   for improving execution without completely uprooting a pretty good system of planning
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:12.800]   that I have in place already? Thanks, Cal. All right. Thanks, Warren. Jesse, he shares
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.960]   my episodes with his class at Rutgers. Yep. I don't want to look this up and figure out that
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:25.920]   his class is listed as something like travesties in media, or the death of good journalism,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:33.600]   case studies in embarrassingly bad new media productions, or something like that. The Nazis
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:42.800]   among us, the crypto-fascist from the whatever, productivity bro-sphere. Hopefully, that's not
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.240]   the course. So Warren, my general rule of thumb here is, as you move up in scale from daily to
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:55.120]   weekly to quarterly or semester, the tightness and specificity of your plan should reduce.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.480]   So when you're doing a daily time-block plan, that's a very constrained plan because you're
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.760]   dealing with an interval of time that you actually have a chance of structuring and
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.440]   constraining. It's like eight hours. What am I doing in each of the hours of my day?
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.240]   Even then, it's hard. You're probably going to redo that plan once or twice as the day unfolds.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.040]   Move up in scale to the weekly plan, you should be less strict.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   We talked about this earlier in the episode, but hey, I want to make progress on this objective
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.240]   this week. Thursday, I got a lot of time free on Thursday. Let me just protect this morning.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.120]   This is when I'm going to work on this report. It's more loose. Let me write down that I really
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.880]   want to get these two things done when I get a chance. Then when you go up to your quarterly
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:44.640]   plan, it's even looser. It's like, okay, I want to see if I can finalize this journal article.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:51.600]   Maybe it would be a real success if I could come out of this semester having refined a
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.960]   book proposal idea. It's getting really high level here. Then when it gets to the scale of
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.880]   multiple semesters or years, I probably don't have any planning at all.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   Let me just get through the fall, and then I'll see what I want to do in the winter.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.320]   So what might be happening here is you're trying to Gantt chart at the highest level,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.880]   multiple months and seasons, and this project is going to overlap this project.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.480]   There's a reason why they stopped using Gantt charts in software development. It's impossible
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.520]   to predict at that scale. You're much better to have a much more loose and ambiguous semester
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:29.360]   plan, work on this paper, try to get this proposal together that has lots of breathing room.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:35.040]   And each week you're like, okay, let me just remember this week that maybe go on a couple
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.920]   walks, think about my book proposal, and let me try to find some time to work on the paper.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.400]   And you know what? I'm having a hard time. I think I'm going to make Monday and Wednesday mornings.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.680]   I'm going to regularly start blocking that off for the paper because I've had a couple of weeks
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.600]   in a row here where I don't have enough time to get things done. So let me jump into the future
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:57.360]   and set this up for a month. You want that planning and insight at that granularity to happen,
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.520]   not these six months I'm working on this and starting one and a half months into this interval,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.680]   I begin working on the second initiative, which will finish after exactly four months.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.840]   You're being too precise. So loosen up your planning, be a little bit easier on yourself.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.880]   This is all about aiming your energy, not about exactly predicting how your energy will unfold.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.360]   This is a line in the article we're going to talk about in the third segment,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.720]   my latest New Yorker piece. I have a line about the idea that this type of planning,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:32.800]   your goal here is not prescience, but instead just intention. You don't want your energy to
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.600]   just be dissipating without direction into the ether, but you're also not trying to be
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:43.440]   Nostradamus about, okay, three months from now, I will be at exactly this point on this project.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.560]   That's a fool's errand. A lot of big, that's why software development doesn't try to do waterfall
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:55.280]   plans anymore. It's just too hard to predict. I want to do a quick case study. This was in
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.960]   response to episode 283, where we were talking about video games and living a deep life. So
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:07.920]   this case study short one comes from a nameless. No, no, Tom, he signed it. Okay. All right. Just
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:14.960]   from Tom. I've just listened to your discussion on video games and episode 283 based on Victor's
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.920]   question. If video games can be part of an intentional life, I practice intentional living
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:25.360]   as much as possible. And I also love games. One thing that has helped me is playing the right
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.760]   kind of games. Intricately crafted award-winning single-player stories can be an art form on par
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.080]   with high quality films. Playing the stories of the, of well-written complex characters is in
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.840]   visually original worlds is a very different experience to the slot machine style of other
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:52.720]   mainstream video games. Firewatch, Inside, Her Story, and Red Dead Redemption 2 are just a few
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:58.560]   examples of superb storytelling and games as an art form. I tend to block out an hour or two of
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.720]   my calendar to play like watching a high quality television drama. I hope that helps. As you both
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.640]   said, you're unfamiliar with the gaming landscape today. Love the show. It's helped a lot.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.320]   I think that's useful, Tom. I completely agree with you.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:18.560]   High quality single-player video games, whatever they call them, class A games where they spend,
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.360]   you know, $150 million developing them is like, or can be like art. Also they're self-limiting.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:32.480]   They're hard. And they're also, the goal is not addiction, right? The goal is just gameplay
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.800]   duration, right? This needs to be a beautiful experience for whatever is typically like
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:43.760]   40 to a hundred hours of gameplay. There's no benefit that gets you to like play it more.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.240]   If anything, if it's like super addictive, you're going to finish the game too fast. And that might
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.400]   even be a problem because you just paid $60 for it. So it's not their incentives to addict you.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.480]   So I think that's fine. Play it an hour or two a day if you like that. I don't think that's a big
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:02.880]   deal. Be wary more of the persistent online massively multiplayer games. I think that can
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.800]   really be a problem. They do want you to play it as much as possible. And those can be really
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.320]   addictive. They can begin to become a replacement for other parts of your life, especially if
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:18.080]   there's other players involved. You're kind of on teams. You're getting this poor granularity
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.120]   this poor fidelity simulacrum of collegiality and relationships, and you're making progress,
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.680]   and your levels are going up. That's where you look up seven hours later and realize, you know,
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.560]   you soiled your chair. Be careful about those games, especially if you're a grown man.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:40.640]   Let's just put it this way. If you find yourself wearing a headset over the age of 25, a headset
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:46.960]   with a boom microphone, and you don't work for a NASCAR stock racing team, be careful about your
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:54.160]   life choices. Or an NFL team. Or an NFL team. That's right. Yeah. If you're an OC. If you're
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.560]   an OC for an NFL team, that's also okay. You can wear a headset. But otherwise, just be wary,
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:07.120]   because that can suck away your energy to do anything else, because it just presses the
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.880]   buttons of what drives us to do meaningful things. It presses those buttons enough that we don't feel
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:19.520]   motivated to get up. But the thing we're doing, the video games, doesn't actually fulfill those
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.960]   needs. And that's the problem. It's like eating really bad junk food will, in the moment, address
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.600]   your hunger sensation. But over time, it's not really what that hunger sensation was trying to
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.280]   get us to do. It's trying to get us to eat food in the way that our bodies recognize from our
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.240]   evolution. And so you're subverting a natural instinct with something that actually doesn't
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.000]   give you, it's lower what you need, and you're going to end up worse. Same thing with social
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.200]   media and social snacking. That's the phenomenon that social psychologists identified, where you
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:53.120]   feel in the moment, like the text messages going back and forth in your text thread or Snapchat
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.440]   or comments on your social media posts. In the moment, you feel like you're scratching the itch
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:04.720]   to be social, but that's not enough sociality. The information stream is too low fidelity,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.520]   and you end up feeling more and more lonely. So you think in the moment, I'm doing this because
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.480]   I want to be connected, but this doesn't really connect you and end up worse off. So just be
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:18.320]   careful about the highly addictive games. Red Redemption 2, Zelda, Breath of the Wild on the
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:24.800]   Switch, all this stuff. That's fine. Those are beautiful games, and I have no problem with you
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:30.720]   playing that. All right. We have a final segment here. Before we do, I want to mention briefly
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:38.160]   another sponsor, longtime sponsor. That is our friends at Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:45.200]   gives you more than 6,500 book summaries and expert-led audio guides to read and listen to,
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:53.040]   each just 15 minutes long. You can access best in class actionable knowledge from 27 categories,
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.400]   such as productivity, psychology, and more. You can do this on the go and be entertained at the
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:04.960]   same time. The way Jesse and I use Blinkist is to help do triage on the list of books we're
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:10.000]   thinking about reading. There's a nonfiction book I'm thinking about reading, and I read a lot,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.080]   70 to 80 books a year. How do I know that this is worth it? I'll listen to the Blink,
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:21.920]   right from the app, 15-minute summary. Oh, I see what this is about, and that's not what I thought,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.440]   or, ooh, this seems even more interesting than before. Let me definitely get it.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.560]   So there's a lot of ways to use Blinkist, but that's one way we use it,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:35.680]   is to help triage which books we've heard about that we think are actually worth buying to read.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.960]   There's also a new promotion they have going on right now. It's called Blinkist Connect
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.080]   that allows you to give another person unlimited access to your account for free. So it's basically

[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:39.600]   is our friends at Policy Genius. Life insurance is one of these things that if there's anyone who
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:46.560]   depends on you, you know you need, or if you have some, you know you probably need a lot more,
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.440]   right? You got to ask how much money would those who depend on me need to be okay
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.760]   if the unfortunate was to happen to me? So we all know this, so why don't we have enough
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.800]   life insurance? Because we don't know how to get it. Do you go to an insurance company? Do you go
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.720]   to a store? Like are they going to make you do feats of endurance to see like whether you qualify
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:15.280]   for insurance? This is where Policy Genius enters the scene because they make this process easy.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.160]   Their technology allows you to compare life insurance quotes from America's top insurers
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:25.440]   in just a few clicks so you can find your lowest price. You know you're paying a good price and not
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:32.560]   getting fleeced and move on on your way. With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   that start at just $292 per year for up to $1 million of coverage. Some of these options offer
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:48.320]   same day approval and avoid unnecessary medical exams. Remember Policy Genius works for you and
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.960]   not the insurance companies. This means they don't have an incentive to recommend one insurer over
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:58.320]   another so you can trust their guidance. So save time and money and provide your family with a
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:05.920]   financial safety net using Policy Genius. Head to policygenius.com/deepquestions or click the link

[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:18.960]   policygenius.com/deepquestions. All right, let's go on to our final segment.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:25.040]   This final segment, I often like to take something that's out there in the world of the internet or
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:35.360]   the news and react to it. So what I'm going to do is I want to load a article here that is by me.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.400]   So I have this on the screen. For those who are watching episode 285 at thedeeplife.com or at
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:48.960]   Cal Newport Media on YouTube, I have loaded my latest article for the New Yorker. It is called
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:56.880]   How to Have a More Productive Year. The subhead, knowledge work is always changing and our
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.920]   approach to it needs to change too. So I just want to summarize a couple of points from this piece.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.400]   It begins with an interesting question. I look at my bookshelf and I see I have productivity
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:18.160]   guides on here because I collect these. The date all the way back to 1959, the earliest modern
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:25.200]   style business productivity guide I have is James T. McKay's book, The Management of Time. And then
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.000]   I have books from there covering every decade up until our current moment in my own books.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.880]   And so early in this article, I actually go through each decade and I look at all these
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.200]   books and I say, OK, here's the motivating question. We've been looking at this question
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.280]   of how to manage your time as a professional since 1959 or before. Why don't we have it figured out?
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.240]   Why isn't there just this is the right way to do it? We've been writing about this forever.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.920]   And so as I go through these books, an answer emerges, which is the challenges of work
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.520]   keep changing. And if we look at the advice in 1959, it looks different than the advice that
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.200]   Peter Drucker gives in 1967, which looks different than the advice that Edwin Bliss gives in the
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.880]   70s, which is different than the advice that Stephen Covey gives in the 80s and 90s,
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.560]   which is quite different than the advice that Alan, David Allen gives in the early 2000s.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:23.120]   Because the demands of work and our relationship with work keeps changing. You read Peter Drucker
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.200]   in 1967. It's a space age optimism. Yeah, you can optimize how you work. Of course,
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.520]   let's get data. Keep a time log of everything you do. Go back and study it. Look for what he calls
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.160]   time wasters. Eliminate those from your schedules. Optimize your time allocation and you'll be great.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:47.280]   Space age optimism. Jump ahead to the 1970s and the book, Edwin C. Bliss's Getting Things Done,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:54.480]   the ABCs of Time Management, all that optimism is gone. The economic malaise was stagflation of the
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:00.800]   1970s and the books is it's bloodless and technocratic. And it's an alphabetical list of
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   different aspects of office life with some advice for each. But then by the 80s, where we get
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.240]   hypercapitalism and navel gazing, self-actualization, we get Stephen Covey that's like, no, no, no,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.400]   here's what we're going to do. The point of all this work is to satisfy your deepest values.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.160]   And we're going to have this really complex system all built around self-actualization.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:29.120]   Here's my roles and they're important to me. And everything aims towards like fulfilling
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:36.400]   my values there. But then you jump to David Allen, Getting Things Done, 2001.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.800]   And suddenly you have a reversal. All of that self-actualization ambition is gone again,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.360]   because what's happening in the world when Allen's writing this book,
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:52.800]   network computers in the office, email, and the explosion in work volume and distraction that
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.640]   has just begun. So Allen's way more nihilistic. He says, forget self-actualization. We just want
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.680]   to automate the hell out of work so that we can just find some mental peace. There's no purpose
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.400]   to our work. We're a machinery gadget, just cranking out widgets. And all we want to do is
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.000]   just try to get some peace among us. He doesn't even care. Let's just have a mind like water
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.880]   moments of zen. He's responding to the issues of the time. So then the piece says, what are the
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:30.000]   issues of our current time? And I would say in the pandemic and pandemic aftermath, too much to do,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.200]   nihilism about our work, like what's all this busyness for, and communication overload are the
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.360]   defining features. And I say, so what's the right advice for right now? And then I give
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.400]   classic Cal Newport advice, right? So if you want to see classic Cal Newport advice,
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.640]   Trojan horsed into the New Yorker, you will find that in this article,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:55.760]   I talk about structured task systems, Trello boards with roles and statuses and columns.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.720]   I talk about multi-scale planning, daily, weekly, quarterly, or strategic, whatever you want to call
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.920]   it. And I talk about communication rules, office hours, for example, things you can put in place,
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.760]   reverse meetings, things you can put in place to take the interactions you have to do in your job
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.560]   and prevent them from unfolding in these asynchronous back and forth all day long.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:24.080]   So it's like the core gospel of Cal Newport. I sort of elaborate these ideas for a new audience.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.880]   And then the end, I do some conclusion. I don't want to give it all away. You should read the
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:35.040]   article. But anyways, I thought this was an interesting point. We're never going to be done
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.880]   with the question of how to be organized in work. And it's because the target shifts.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.400]   So we have to be okay with that. There is no canonical system we'll ever arrive at
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.760]   that we can say, now we know how to work. We are going to have to keep updating.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.800]   The key is doing this without making that updating of our system all we ever do.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.840]   So I'm going to read from my conclusion here to sort of summarize how I'm thinking about that.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.800]   How do we keep reappraising the way we work without getting lost in endless tweaking and
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:14.480]   upgrading of our organizational systems? Not maintaining any type of to-do list is a bad idea,
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.280]   but so is the quixotic chase of a perfect system that doesn't actually exist.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.800]   The challenge in cultivating a sustainable approach to modern knowledge work is to locate the space
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.880]   between productivity fetishism and the knee-jerk rejection of productivity thinking as toxic or
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:36.640]   unnecessary. To achieve and hold a position of leadership in this age of innovation, a man must
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:42.400]   spend a part of every day in self-development, James McKay writes in the preface to his 1959
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   advice guide. He was more right than he likely realized. We're never free from the need to keep
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.400]   reassessing how we work, but we cannot let this become the entire story. It's a bit of meta advice
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.520]   for everything we do here. It is important to keep thinking about in our current technological
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.560]   work moment, what's the right way to work. You don't want to be haphazard, but once you have
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.440]   a plan that works, execute and get on with the other stuff. Check in every once in a while,
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   keep up with what you need to change in the world of work, but don't make thinking about how you
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.520]   work be your primary activity. It's easier said than done, but I think that's the challenge we
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.320]   all face. That's the challenge hopefully I'm helping you with on this podcast. All right,
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.160]   Jesse, I think we should wrap it up there. We did about two and a half hour of podcasting right
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.720]   before this. I read an audio book all last week, so I don't know how much of my voice is left.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.760]   Let's call it quits now, but thank you everyone for listening. I'll be back next week with another
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.440]   episode of the show, and until then, as always, stay deep. If you liked today's episode about the
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:53.120]   productivity paradox, I think you'll also like episode 283 about how to organize your life.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.760]   Check it out. There clearly is a real hunger out there for transforming your
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.600]   life into something more intentional and more deep.
