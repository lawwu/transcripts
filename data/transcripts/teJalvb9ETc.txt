[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   What is time? Time is a computational phenomenon.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.520]   Time is the progressive change of the network.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.880]   One particle touches another one, touches another one,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360]   this thing changes this one, this changes this one.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   Sounds to me like you're describing your cellular automata.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.960]   Yes, it's very much like that. It's a computational process.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.840]   And it happens to be operating on these hypergraphs
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.000]   rather than just lines of black and white cells.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.160]   So the universe itself is a computer... - Yes.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.280]   ...running a computational exercise.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.800]   Yes, well, I don't know whether you'd call it an exercise, but...
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.720]   It is computing. - Yes, it is computing.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.120]   And that's what the progress of time is.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.920]   And time is the progress of that computation. - Yes.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.520]   And that is what people mean when they say, "Are we living in a simulation?"
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   No.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   (MUSIC)
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.300]   you
