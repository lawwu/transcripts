[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.780]   Today marks the first Journal Club episode
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.440]   between myself and Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.840]   For any of you that are not familiar with Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   he is a medical doctor and MD
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.760]   who is an expert in all aspects of health and lifespan.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.680]   He is the author of a bestselling book entitled "Outlive,"
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.300]   which is a phenomenal resource
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.440]   on all things healthspan and lifespan.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.960]   And he is the host of the very popular podcast, "The Drive,"
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.160]   where he interviews various experts
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.960]   in all domains of medicine and scientists as well.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.160]   Today, Peter and I hold
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.920]   our first online collaborative Journal Club.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.160]   For those of you that aren't familiar
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.600]   with what a Journal Club is,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200]   a Journal Club is a common practice in graduate school
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.520]   and/or medical school,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400]   whereby students get together to discuss one or two papers
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.960]   to critique those papers
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.120]   and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.740]   with the conclusions of the authors
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.820]   and to highlight any key takeaways.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.880]   Peter and I have been wanting
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.860]   to do a Journal Club together for a very long time,
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.760]   and we decided to do that Journal Club
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.640]   and to record it for you.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100]   So today, you will be sitting in
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.280]   on the first Huberman-Attia Journal Club.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   By the way, it could just have easily been called
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280]   the Attia-Huberman Journal Club.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.120]   And we will discuss two papers.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.400]   First, Peter is going to discuss a paper on metformin,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760]   which is a drug that many people are interested in
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.980]   for its potential role in longevity.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.680]   I want to highlight potential there.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.720]   He's going to compare that paper
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.680]   to previous findings on metformin.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.360]   And by the end of that discussion,
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.080]   he will advise as to whether or not
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.180]   he himself would take metformin
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080]   and whether or not other people might be well-advised
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.080]   or ill-advised to take metformin
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   based on the data in that paper and at this time.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.860]   Then I present a paper which is about the placebo effect.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.040]   I have to imagine that most of you
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.760]   have heard of the placebo effect,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.000]   but what's interesting about the paper
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.320]   that we discussed today is that it shows
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   that the placebo effect can actually follow a dose response.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.960]   So it's not just all or none.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.580]   It actually is the case that you can scale
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.360]   the degree of placebo effect
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.780]   depending on whether or not you're thinking
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420]   you're taking low doses, moderate doses,
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.240]   or high doses of a particular drug.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.200]   And the particular drug that's discussed
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.960]   in the paper that I cover is nicotine.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.320]   So for those of you that are interested
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmacology,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.660]   or frankly, for people who are simply interested
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080]   in how our beliefs can shape our physiology,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.960]   I think you'll find that discussion to be very interesting.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.400]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.800]   you will not only have learned
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.000]   about two novel sets of findings,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   one in the realm of longevity as it relates to metformin
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.360]   and another in the realm of neurobiology
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000]   and placebos or placebo effects,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.160]   but you will also learn how a journal club is conducted.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   I think you'll see in observing how we parse these papers
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.540]   and discuss them, even arguing in them at times,
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.940]   that what scientists and clinicians do
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.680]   is they take a look at the existing peer-reviewed research
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600]   and they look at that peer-reviewed research
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   with a fresh eye asking,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.080]   does this paper really show what it claims to show or not?
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.820]   And in some cases, the answer is yes.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.620]   And in other cases, the answer is no.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.640]   What I know is for certain
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   is that by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820]   you will learn a lot of science,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.440]   you'll learn a lot about health practices,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.000]   some of which you may want to apply or avoid,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.880]   and you'll learn a lot
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.580]   about how science and medicine is carried out.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.360]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.960]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.040]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.460]   Helix Sleep makes customized mattresses
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.880]   to give you the best possible night's sleep.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.920]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.600]   When we are sleeping well and enough,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.620]   mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.160]   all stand to be at their best.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.020]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.640]   is to make sure that your mattress
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   is tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.920]   Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.460]   that if you go to their website,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.280]   you take that quiz and answer questions
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.920]   such as, do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.800]   your side of your stomach?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.280]   Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.120]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   and that's fine.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   At the end of that two-minute quiz,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.280]   they will match you to a mattress
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.240]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.800]   I sleep on the Dusk, a D-U-S-K, mattress.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.780]   And when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.480]   about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.320]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.740]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.000]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.340]   And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.880]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.160]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.260]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.800]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.200]   how different foods and behaviors affect your health
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.940]   by giving you real-time feedback
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.060]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.400]   One of the most important factors
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.860]   impacting your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.540]   is the way that your body manages its blood glucose,
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.200]   or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.780]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.540]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540]   without big spikes or dips.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.320]   Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.160]   and different food combinations,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.760]   as well as food timing and things like exercise,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.360]   combine to impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.800]   I started using Levels a little over a year ago,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.160]   and it gave me a lot of insight
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.800]   into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.380]   and then leaving me feeling tired
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.960]   for several hours afterwards,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.160]   as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.200]   was impacting my overall energy.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.500]   And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.480]   how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.180]   such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.720]   are stable throughout the day.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.560]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.200]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.020]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.320]   Right now, Levels is offering
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.220]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.100]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman,
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.040]   to get two free months of membership.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.120]   And now for my Journal Club discussion
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.800]   with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.160]   Peter, so good to have you here.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.540]   - So great to be here, my friend.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.680]   - This is something that you and I
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   have been wanting to do for a while.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.540]   And it's basically something that we do all the time,
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.160]   which is to peruse the literature
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   and find papers that we are excited about
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.540]   for whatever reason.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.600]   And oftentimes that will lead to a text dialogue
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.620]   or a phone call or both.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.940]   But this time we've opted to try talking about these papers
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.180]   that we find particularly exciting in real time
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.220]   for the first time as this podcast format.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.240]   First of all, so that people can get some sense
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.820]   of why we're so excited about these papers.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.700]   We do feel that people should know about these findings.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.440]   And second of all, that it's an opportunity for people
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.980]   to learn how to dissect information
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.600]   and think about the papers they hear about in the news,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.460]   the papers they might download from PubMed
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.940]   if they're inclined.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.140]   Also just to start thinking like scientists and clinicians
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.440]   and get a better sense of what it looks like
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.620]   to pick through a paper, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.880]   So we're flying a little blind here, which is fun.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.960]   I'm definitely excited for all the above reasons.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.060]   - Yeah, no, this is...
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.900]   You and I have been talking about this for some time.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.020]   And actually we used to run a journal club
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.340]   inside the practice where once a month,
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.420]   one person would just pick a paper
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.380]   and we would go through it in kind of
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.100]   a formal journal club presentation.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.260]   We've gotten away from it for the last year
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.500]   just because we've been a little stretched then.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.220]   I think it's something we need to resume
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.940]   because it's a great way to learn.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.980]   And it's a skill.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.140]   People probably ask you all the time,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.780]   'cause I know I get asked all the time,
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.380]   hey, what are the dos and don'ts
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.560]   of interpreting scientific papers?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.220]   Is it enough to just read the abstract?
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.020]   And usually the answer is, well, no.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.700]   But the how-to is tougher.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.660]   And I think the two papers we've chosen today
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.820]   illustrate two opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.180]   You're gonna obviously talk about something
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.780]   that we're gonna probably get into
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.220]   the technical nature of the assays,
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.620]   the limitations, et cetera.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.240]   And the paper ultimately I've chosen to present,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.700]   although I apologize, I'm surprising you with this,
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.540]   up until a few minutes ago,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.280]   is actually a very straightforward,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.600]   simple epidemiologic paper
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.780]   that I think has important significance.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.400]   I had originally gone down the rabbit hole
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.740]   on a much more nuanced paper about ATP binding cassettes
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.520]   in cholesterol absorption.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   But ultimately I thought this one
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.060]   might be more interesting to a broader audience.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.280]   By the way, I gotta tell you a funny story.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.480]   So I had a dream last night about you.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.520]   And in this dream, you were obsessed
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   with making this certain drink that was like your elixir.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.080]   And it had all of these crazy ingredients in it.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.160]   - Supplements.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.440]   - Tons of supplements in it.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.400]   But the one thing I remembered when I woke up,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   'cause I forgot most of them,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.740]   I was really trying so hard to remember them.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.760]   One thing that you had in it was dew.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.160]   Like you had to collect a certain amount of dew
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   off the leaves every morning to put into this drink.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.400]   It was so, but it was like just--
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.360]   - It sounds like something that I would do.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.840]   - And so, but here's the best part.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.360]   You had like a thermos of this stuff
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.020]   that had to be with you everywhere.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.080]   And all of your clothing had to be tailored
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.440]   with a special pocket that you could put the thermos into
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   so that you were never without the special Andrew drink.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.800]   And again, you know how dreams, when you're having them,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.840]   seem so logical and real,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   and then you wake up and you're like,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.760]   that doesn't even make sense.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.240]   Like, why would he want the thermos in his shirt?
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.480]   Like that would warm it up.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.560]   Like, you know, all these,
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.720]   but boy, it was a realistic dream.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.960]   And there were lots of things in it, including dew.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.640]   Special dew off the leaves every morning.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.600]   - I love it.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.520]   Well, it's not that far from reality.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.640]   I'm a big fan of yerba mate.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   I'm drinking it right now, in fact,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.820]   in its many forms, usually the loose leaf.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.360]   I don't tend to drink it out of the gourd.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.800]   My dad's Argentine, so that's where I picked it up.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.600]   I started drinking it when I was like five years old
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.240]   or younger, which I don't recommend people do.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.140]   It's heavily caffeinated.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.800]   Don't drink the smoked versions either, folks.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.640]   I think that was potentially carcinogenic.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.960]   But this thing that you describe
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.200]   of carrying around the thermos close to the body,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.800]   if you are ever in Uruguay,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.720]   or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.120]   anywhere in the world, carrying a thermos with them
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.320]   and to their meals and hugging it close,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.000]   chances are they're Uruguay.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.400]   And they're drinking yerba mate.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.200]   They drink it usually after their meals.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.960]   It's supposed to be good for your digestion.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.360]   So it's not that far from reality.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   I don't carry the thermos, but I do drink mate every day.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.960]   And I'm going to start collecting dew off the leaves.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.480]   - Just a few drops every morning.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.740]   [laughing]
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.300]   - Oh my.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.720]   Some other time we can talk about dreams.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.920]   Recently, I've been doing some dream exploration.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.580]   I've had some absolutely transformative dreams
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.760]   for the first time in my life.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.400]   One dream in particular that allowed me to feel something
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.780]   I've never felt before and has catalyzed a large number
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.120]   of important decisions in a way that no other experience,
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.600]   waking or sleep, has ever impacted me.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.680]   And this was drug-free, et cetera.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.720]   - And do you think you could have had that dream,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.900]   we don't have to get into it if you don't want
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.620]   to talk about it now, but was there a lot of work
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.360]   you had to do to prepare for that dream to have taken place?
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.000]   - Oh yes, yeah.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   At least 18 months of intensive analysis type work
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.820]   with a very skilled psychiatrist.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.440]   But I wasn't trying to seed the dream.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.720]   It was just I was at a sticking point
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.200]   with a certain process in my life.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.760]   And then I was taking a walk while waking
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   and realized that my brain, my subconscious,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.680]   was going to keep working on this.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.480]   I just decided it's going to keep working on it.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.860]   And then two nights later, I traveled to a meeting
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.240]   in Aspen and I had the most profound dream ever
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.500]   where I was able to sense something and feel something
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.520]   I've always wanted to feel as so real within the dream.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.000]   Woke up, knew it was a dream and realized
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   this is what people close to me that I respect
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   have been talking about, but I was able to feel it
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.360]   and therefore I can actually access this in my waking life.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.700]   It was absolutely transformative for me.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.840]   Anyway, sometime I can share more details
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   with you or the audience, but for now,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.400]   maybe we should talk about these papers.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.240]   - Very well.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.760]   - Who should go first?
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.800]   - I'm happy to go first.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.640]   - Great, yeah.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.880]   - This is a pretty straightforward paper.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.600]   So we're going to talk about a paper titled
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   Reassessing the Evidence of a Survival Advantage
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.740]   in Type 2 Diabetics Treated with Metformin
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.460]   Compared with Controls Without Diabetes,
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.260]   a Retrospective Cohort Study.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.480]   This is by Matthew Thomas Keyes and colleagues.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.620]   This was published last fall.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.200]   Why is this paper important?
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.720]   So this paper is important because in 2014,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.940]   Bannister published a paper that I think in many ways
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.720]   kind of got the world very excited about metformin.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.880]   So this was almost 10 years ago.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.320]   And I'm sure many people have heard about this paper,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.440]   even if they're not familiar with it,
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.620]   but they've heard the concept of the paper.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.080]   And in many ways, it's the paper that has led
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.820]   to the excitement around the potential
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.240]   for giroprotection with metformin.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.280]   And I should probably just define for the audience
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.780]   what giroprotection means.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.620]   When we think of--
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.540]   - And probably also, sorry to interrupt,
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.680]   what metformin is, just for the uninformed.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   - That's a great point.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   So I'll start with the latter.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.220]   So metformin is a drug that has been used
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.600]   for many years, depends where it was first approved,
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.440]   I think was in Europe.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.200]   But call it directionally, 50 plus years of use
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   as a first line agent for patients with type 2 diabetes.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.560]   In the US, maybe 40 plus years.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.840]   So this is a drug that's been around forever,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.800]   trade name, Glucophage, or brand name.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.000]   But again, it's a generic drug today.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   The mechanism by which metformin works is debated hotly.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.900]   But what I think is not debated
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.540]   is the immediate thing that metformin does,
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.900]   which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.320]   So again, maybe just taking a step back.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.420]   So the mitochondria, as everybody thinks of those
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.940]   as the cellular engine for making ATP.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.960]   So the most efficient way that we make ATP
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.260]   is through oxidative phosphorylation,
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.140]   where we take either fatty acid pieces
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.340]   or a breakdown product of glucose
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.800]   once it's partially metabolized to pyruvate.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.140]   We put that into an electron transport chain.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   And we basically trade chemical energy for electrons
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.580]   that can then be used to make phosphates onto ADP.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.580]   So it's, you know, you think of everything you do.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.260]   Eating is taking the chemical energy in food,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.000]   taking the energy that's in those bonds,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.580]   making electrical energy in the mitochondria.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.420]   Those electrons pump a gradient that allow you to make ATP.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.700]   To give a sense of how primal and important this is,
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.120]   if you block that process completely, you die.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.880]   So everybody's probably heard of cyanide, right?
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.320]   Cyanide is something that is incredibly toxic,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.020]   even at the smallest doses.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.540]   Cyanide is a complete blocker of this process.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.880]   And if my memory serves me correctly,
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.320]   I think it blocks complex four of the mitochondria.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.080]   I don't know if you recall if it complex three
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.240]   or complex four.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.080]   I know a lot about toxins that impact the nervous system,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.220]   but I don't know a lot about poisons.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.060]   - The mitochondria, yeah.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.280]   - But if ever you want to have some fun,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.480]   we can talk about all the dangerous stuff
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.600]   that animals make and insects make and how they kill you.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.960]   - Yeah, like detrototoxin and all these things
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.800]   that block sodium channels, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.000]   - Alpha-lactotoxin, bungroda.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.680]   I really geek out on this stuff
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.120]   'cause it allows me to talk about neuroscience,
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.380]   animals, and scary stuff.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.220]   It's like combines it.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.420]   So we could do that sometime for fun,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.080]   maybe at the end if we have a few moments.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.360]   - So, you know, something like cyanide
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.800]   that is a very potent inhibitor of this
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.720]   electron transport chain will kill you instantly.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.760]   People understand that, of course, a drop of cyanide
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.000]   and you would be dead literally instantaneously.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.180]   So Metformin works at the first of those complexes.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.400]   I believe there are four, if my memory serves correctly,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   four electron transport chain complexes.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.700]   But of course it's not a complete inhibition of it.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.160]   It's just kind of a weak blocker of that.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.500]   And the net effect of that is what?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.960]   So the net effect of that is that it changes the ratio
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.360]   of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine diphosphate.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.480]   What's less clear is why does that
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.720]   have a benefit in diabetics?
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.640]   Because what it unambiguously does is reduces
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.060]   the amount of glucose that the liver puts out.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.960]   So hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.600]   that's happening in type two diabetes.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.280]   You may recall, I think we talked about this
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.000]   even on a previous podcast,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.400]   you and I sitting here with normal blood sugar
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.960]   have about five grams of glucose in our total circulation.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.080]   That's it, five grams.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.840]   Think about how quickly the brain will go through that
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.200]   within minutes.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.240]   So the only thing that keeps us alive
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.100]   is our liver's ability to titrate out glucose.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.120]   And if it puts out too much, for example,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.400]   if the glucose level was consistently two teaspoons,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.040]   you would have type two diabetes.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.880]   So the difference between being metabolically healthy
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.920]   and having profound type two diabetes is one teaspoon
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.100]   of glucose in your bloodstream.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.560]   So the ability of the liver to tamp down
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.600]   on high glucose output is important.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.720]   Metformin seems to do that.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.880]   - Can I just ask one question?
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.840]   Is it fair to provide this overly simplified summary
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.140]   of the biochemistry, which is that when we eat,
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.920]   the food is broken down, but the breaking of bonds
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.040]   creates energy that then our cells can use
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.200]   in the form of ATP.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.440]   And the mitochondria are central to that process.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.560]   And that metformin is partially short-circuiting
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   the energy production process.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.780]   And so even though we are eating,
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.640]   when we have metformin in our system, presumably,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.020]   there is going to be less net glucose.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.560]   The bonds are going to be broken down.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.920]   We're chewing, we're digesting,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.060]   but less of that is turned into blood sugar, glucose.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.120]   - Well, sort of.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   I mean, it's not depriving you of ultimately
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.800]   storing that energy.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.480]   What it's doing is changing the way
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   the body partitions fuel.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.760]   That's probably a better way to think about it
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.000]   to be a little bit more accurate.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.240]   So for example, like it's not depriving you
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.540]   of the calories that are in that glucose.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.040]   That would be fantastic, but that's not--
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.120]   - That was the elastro.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.560]   Remember the elastro from the '90s?
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   Elastro, folks, for those of you who don't remember,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.320]   by the way, if you ever ate this stuff, you'd remember,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.960]   because it was a fat that was not easily digested.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.620]   It had sort of analogous to plant fiber
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.460]   or something like that.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.520]   So it was being put into potato chips and whatnot.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   And the idea was that people would simply excrete it.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.120]   And I don't know what happened,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.400]   except that people got a lot of stomach aches.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.000]   - Well, the anal seepage. - Everyone got fatter
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.820]   in the world.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.660]   We know that.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.880]   - The anal seepage is what really did that product in.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.720]   - Anal seepage.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   - Only a physician, because after all,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.200]   Peter's a clinician, a physician, an MD, and I'm not,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   could find it an appropriate term to describe
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.540]   what this is. - Yeah.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.440]   When you have that much fat malabsorption,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.100]   you start to have accidents.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.000]   - Wow.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.840]   And so--
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.040]   - So that did away with that product.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   - Right.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.800]   It was either that or the diaper industry
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.280]   was going to really take off.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.120]   Okay.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.440]   That's why you don't hear about elastro.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.280]   - That's right.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.200]   So we've got this drug.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.480]   We've got this drug metformin.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.480]   It's considered a perfect first line agent
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.780]   for people with type two diabetes.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.600]   So again, what's happening when you have type two diabetes,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   the primary insult probably occurs in the muscles
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.000]   and it is insulin resistance.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.040]   Everybody hears that term.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.360]   What does it mean?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.000]   Insulin is a peptide.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.840]   It binds to a receptor on a cell.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.680]   So let's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.580]   'cause the muscle is responsible for most glucose disposal.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.560]   It gets glucose out of the circulation.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.900]   High glucose is toxic.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.320]   We have to put it away.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.720]   And we want to put most of it into our muscles.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.760]   That's where we store 75 to 80% of it.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.960]   When insulin binds to the insulin receptor,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.800]   a tyrosine kinase is triggered inside.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.020]   So just ignore all that.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.880]   But a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.920]   that leads to a phosphorylation.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.520]   So ATP donates a phosphate group.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.360]   And a transporter, just think of like a little tunnel,
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.160]   like a little straw goes up through the level of the cell.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   And now glucose can freely flow in.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.520]   So I'm sure you've talked a lot about this
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.840]   with your audience.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.240]   Things that move against gradients need pumps to move them.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.220]   Things that move with gradients don't.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.080]   Glucose is moving with its gradient into the cell.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.400]   It doesn't need active transport,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.820]   but it does need the transporter put there.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.760]   That requires the energy.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.900]   That's the job of insulin.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.160]   - By the way, I did not know that.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.020]   I mean, I certainly know active and passive transport
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.320]   as it relates to like neurotransmitter and ion flow.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.200]   But I'd never heard that when insulin binds to a cell
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.480]   that literally a little straw
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.140]   is placed into the membrane of the cell.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.400]   - Yeah, the glucose doesn't need a pump to move it in.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.560]   Because there's much more glucose
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   outside the cell than inside.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.760]   So it's just, but the energy required
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.560]   is to move the straw up to the cell.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.940]   - Cell biology is so cool.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.780]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.780]   So what happens is as, and Gerald Shulman at Yale
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.600]   did the best work on elucidating this,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.340]   as the intramuscular fat increases,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.040]   and by intramuscular, I mean intracellular fat,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.000]   triacyl and diacylglycerides accumulate in a muscle cell,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.360]   that signal gets interrupted.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.660]   And all of a sudden, I'm making these numbers up,
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.160]   if you used to need two units of insulin
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.480]   to trigger the little transporter now, you need three,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.020]   and then you need four, and then you need five.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.300]   You need more and more insulin to get the thing up.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.840]   That is the definition of insulin resistance.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.000]   The cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insulin.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.560]   And therefore, the early mark of insulin resistance,
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.500]   the canary in the coal mine is not an increase in glucose.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.360]   It's an increase in insulin.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.320]   So normal glycemia with hyperinsulinemia,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.740]   especially postprandial,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.200]   meaning after you eat hyperinsulinemia,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.600]   is the thing that tells you,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.180]   hey, you're five, 10 years away
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.160]   from this being a real problem.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.300]   So fast forward many steps down the line,
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.800]   someone with type 2 diabetes has long passed that system.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.000]   Now, not only are they insulin resistant,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.380]   where they just need a boatload of insulin,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.840]   which is made by the pancreas,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.240]   to get glucose out of the circulation,
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.920]   but now that system's not even working well.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.420]   And now they're not getting glucose into the cell.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.920]   So now their glucose level is elevated.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.060]   And even though it's continually being chewed up
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.180]   and used up, because again, the brain alone
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.300]   would account for most of that glucose disposal,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.660]   the liver is now becoming insulin resistant as well.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.400]   And now the liver isn't able to regulate
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.460]   how much glucose to put into circulation,
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.580]   and it's overdoing it.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.300]   So now you have too much glucose
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   being pumped into the circulation by the liver,
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.620]   and you have the muscles that can't dispose of it.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.980]   And it's really a vicious, brutal cascade,
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.180]   because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.260]   is now starting to happen in the pancreas.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.660]   And now the relatively few cells in the pancreas
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.700]   called beta cells that make insulin
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.000]   are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.620]   within the pancreas itself.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.060]   And so now the thing that you need to make more insulin
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   is less effective at making insulin.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.300]   So ultimately way, way, way down the line,
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.900]   a person with type 2 diabetes
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.740]   might actually even require insulin exogenously.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.020]   - Could you share with us a few of the causes
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.980]   of type 2 diabetes of insulin resistance?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.820]   I mean, one it sounds like is accumulating too much fat.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.140]   - Yeah, so energy imbalance would be an enormous one.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.660]   Inactivity or insufficient activity
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.500]   is probably the single most important.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   So when Gerald Schulman was running clinical trials at Yale,
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   they would be recruiting undergrads to study, obviously,
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.380]   'cause you're typically recruiting young people.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.580]   And they would be doing these very detailed
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.140]   mechanistic studies where they would require
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.300]   actual tissue biopsies.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.580]   So you're gonna biopsy somebody's quadriceps
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.860]   and actually look at what's happening in the muscle.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.540]   Well, I remember him telling me this
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.940]   when I interviewed him on my podcast.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.580]   He said, "The most important criteria
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.740]   of the people we interviewed is that,"
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.620]   'cause they were still lean.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.860]   These weren't people that were overweight,
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.460]   but they had to be inactive.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.180]   You couldn't have active people in these studies.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.100]   So exercising is one of the most important things
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.360]   you're going to do to ward off insulin resistance.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.200]   But there are other things
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.820]   that can cause insulin resistance.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.860]   Sleep deprivation has a profound impact
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.820]   on insulin resistance.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.440]   I think we probably talked about this previously,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.180]   but if you, you know, some very elegant mechanistic studies
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.860]   where you sleep deprive people, you know,
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.500]   you let them only sleep for four hours for a week,
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.660]   you'll reduce their glucose disposal by about half.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.500]   - Wow.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.720]   - Which is, I mean, that's a staggering amount of,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.260]   you're basically inducing profound insulin resistance
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.000]   in just a week of sleep deprivation.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.320]   Hypercortisolemia is another factor,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.680]   and then obviously energy imbalance.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.760]   So where, when you're accumulating excess energy,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.840]   when you're getting fatter,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.040]   if you start spilling that fat
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   outside of the subcutaneous fat cells
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.140]   into the muscle, into the liver, into the pancreas,
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.160]   all of those things are exacerbating it.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.280]   - Got it.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.960]   Okay, so enter metformin, first line drug.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.380]   So most of the drugs,
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.520]   so every drug you give a person with type 2 diabetes
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.200]   is trying to address part of this chain.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.000]   So some of the drugs tell you to make more insulin.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.340]   That's one of the strategies.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.940]   So here are drugs like sulfonylureas.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.000]   They tell the body, make more insulin.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.880]   Other drugs like insulin
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.120]   just give you more of the insulin thing.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.420]   Metformin tackles the problem elsewhere.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.980]   It tamps down glucose by addressing the glucose,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.300]   the hepatic glucose output channel.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.460]   GLP-1 agonists are another drug.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.260]   They increase insulin sensitivity,
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.980]   initially causing you to also make more insulin.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.380]   GLP-1 agonists- - So that's osempic.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.220]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.540]   - Yeah. - And is it true
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.300]   that berberine is more or less the poor man's metformin?
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.140]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.500]   - Yeah. - It's from a tree bark.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.460]   It just happens to have the same properties of-
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.300]   - Yeah, and by the way, metformin-
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.780]   - Reducing mTOR and reducing blood glucose.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.180]   - Yeah, and metformin, by the way,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.140]   occurs from a lilac plant in France.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.220]   Like that's where it was discovered.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.900]   So it's also, metformin is also based
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.660]   on a substance found in nature.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.180]   - So you need a prescription for metformin.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.940]   You don't need a prescription for berberine.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.780]   - Correct. - But yeah,
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.180]   we can talk about berberine a little bit later.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.580]   I had a couple great experiences with berberine
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.100]   and a couple bad experiences.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.980]   - Interesting. - Berberine, yeah.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.340]   - So maybe taking one step back from this.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:53.340]   In 2011, I became very interested in metformin personally,
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.460]   just reading about it, obsessing over it,
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.180]   and just somehow decided like, I should be taking this.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.020]   So I actually began taking metformin.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.620]   I still remember exactly when I started.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.600]   I started it in May of 2011, and I realized that
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.260]   because I was on a trip with a bunch of buddies.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.860]   We went to the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.340]   which is, you know, the Buffett shareholder meeting.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.740]   And, you know, it was kind of like a fun thing to do.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.480]   And I remember being so sick the whole time
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.300]   because I didn't titrate up the dose of metformin.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.340]   I just went straight to two grams a day,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.240]   which is kind of like the full dose.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.740]   And we went to this-
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.600]   - Is that characteristic of your approach to things?
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.520]   - Yes, I think that's safe to say.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.260]   - Next time, I'll give you a thermos of this dew
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.260]   that I collect in the morning.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.740]   - Oh, really? (laughing)
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.340]   So I remember being so sick that the whole time
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.940]   we were in Nebraska or Omaha, I guess, I couldn't,
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.260]   we went to Dairy Queen 'cause you do all the Buffett things
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.220]   when you're there, right?
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.100]   Like I couldn't have an ice cream at Dairy Queen.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.940]   - You couldn't? - I mean, I couldn't.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.020]   I was so nauseous.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.620]   - Oh, 'cause I would say if you've got metformin
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.020]   in your system, you're gonna buffer glucose.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.180]   You could have four ice cream cones and probably-
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.140]   - Except I couldn't keep anything down.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.860]   I mean, I was so nauseous.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.700]   So clearly metformin has this side effect initially,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   which is a little bit of appetite suppression.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.100]   But regardless, that's the story on metformin.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.740]   There were a lot of reasons I was interested in it.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.280]   I wasn't thinking true zero protection.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   That term wasn't in my vernacular at the time.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.380]   But what I was thinking is, hey,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.860]   this is gonna help you buffer glucose better.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.700]   It's gotta be better.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.360]   And this was sort of my first foray into, you know,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.460]   self-experimentation.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.040]   - Do you wanna define zero protection?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.000]   It's a good term to define.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.460]   - Geriatric zero?
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.660]   - Yeah, so yeah, zero from geriatric old protection.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.460]   So protection from aging.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.460]   And when we talk about a drug like metformin or rapamycin
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.700]   or even NAD, NR, these things,
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.720]   the idea is we're talking about them as zero protective
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.340]   to signal that they are drugs
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.540]   that are not targeting a specific disease of aging.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:55.060]   For example, a PCSK9 inhibitor is sort of zero protective,
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.740]   but it's targeting one specific pathway,
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.940]   which is cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.180]   Whereas the idea is a zero protective agent
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.960]   would target hallmarks of aging.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.220]   There are nine hallmarks of aging.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.760]   Please don't ask me to recite them.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.300]   I've never been able to get all nine straight,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.920]   but people know what we're talking about, right?
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.900]   So decreased autophagy, increased senescence,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.400]   decreased nutrient sensing or defective nutrient sensing,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.740]   proteomic instability, genomic instability, methylation,
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.180]   all of these things, epigenetic changes.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.700]   Those are all the nine hallmarks of aging.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.860]   - You got seven.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.780]   - So a zero protective agent would target
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.860]   those deep down biological hallmarks of aging.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.560]   And in 2014, a paper came out by Bannister
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.240]   that basically got the world focused on this problem.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.620]   By the world, I mean the world of anti-aging.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.020]   So what Bannister and colleagues did
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.660]   was they took a registry from the UK
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.660]   and they got a set of patients who were on metformin
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.100]   with type two diabetes, but only metformin.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.440]   So these were people who had just progressed to diabetes.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   They were not put on any other drug, just metformin.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.040]   And then they found from the same registry,
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.660]   a group of matched controls.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.200]   So this is a standard way
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.100]   that epidemiologic studies are done.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.500]   Because again, you don't have the luxury
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.920]   of doing the randomization.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.740]   So you're trying to account for all the biases
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.720]   that could exist by saying, we're gonna take people
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.080]   who look just like that person with diabetes.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   So can we match them for age, sex, socioeconomic status,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:37.420]   blood pressure, BMI, everything we can.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.900]   And then let's look at what happened to them over time.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.920]   Now again, this is all happening in the future.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.980]   So you're looking into the past.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.380]   It's retrospective in that sense.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.460]   And so let me just kind of pull up the sort of table here
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.540]   so I can kind of walk through.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.900]   And this is not in the paper we talked about,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.740]   but I think this is an important background.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.740]   So they did something that at the time
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.460]   I didn't really notice.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.660]   I didn't notice what they did.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.340]   I probably did and I forgot.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.780]   But I didn't notice this until about five years ago
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.020]   when I went back and looked at the paper.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.980]   And they did something called informative censoring.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.420]   So the way the study worked is if you were put on metformin,
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.440]   we're gonna follow you.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.180]   If you're not on metformin, we're gonna follow you.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.400]   And we're gonna track the number of deaths
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.820]   from any cause that occur.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.260]   This is called all-cause mortality or ACM.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.940]   And it's really the gold standard in a trial of this nature
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.840]   or a study of this nature or even a clinical trial.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.700]   You wanna know how much are people dying from anything
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.500]   'cause we're trying to prevent or delay death of all causes.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   Informative censoring says if a person
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.140]   who's on metformin deviates from that inclusion criteria,
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.100]   we will not count them in the final assessment.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.280]   So how are the ways that that can happen?
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.720]   Well, one, the person can be lost to follow up.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.180]   Two, they can just stop taking their metformin.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.300]   Three, and more commonly, they can progress
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.480]   to needing a more significant drug.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.660]   So all of those patients were excluded from the study.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.840]   So think about that for a moment.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.420]   This is, in my opinion,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.240]   a significant limitation of this study.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.580]   Because what you're basically doing is saying
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.900]   we're only gonna consider the patients
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.320]   who were on metformin, stayed on metformin,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.880]   and never progressed through it.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.980]   And we're gonna compare those to people
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.740]   who were not having type 2 diabetes.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.300]   So an analogy here would be imagine we're gonna do a study
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.240]   of two groups that we think are almost identical.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.740]   One of them are smokers,
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.260]   and the other are identical in every way,
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.140]   but they're not smokers.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.980]   And we're gonna follow them
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.740]   to see which ones get lung cancer.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.260]   But every time somebody dies in the smoking group,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.980]   we stop counting them.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.100]   When you get to the end,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.060]   you're going to have a less significant view
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.660]   of the health status of that group.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.060]   So with that caveat,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.780]   the Bannister study found a very interesting result,
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.660]   which was the crude death rate
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.740]   was, and by the way, the way these are done,
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.020]   this is also one of the challenges of epidemiology
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.580]   is the math gets much more complicated.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.380]   You have to normalize death rate
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.920]   for the amount of time you study the people.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.000]   So everything is normalized to 1,000 person years.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.540]   So the crude death rate in the group of people
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.980]   with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin,
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.760]   including the censoring, was 14.4.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   So 14.4 deaths occurred per 1,000 patient years.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.640]   If you look at the control group, it was 15.2.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.060]   This was a startling result.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.800]   And I remember reading this in, again, 2014
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.080]   and being like, holy crap, this is really amazing.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.320]   - Is there, could you explain why?
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.880]   'Cause I hear those numbers
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.200]   and they don't seem that striking.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.620]   It's a difference of about a year and a half.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.020]   Now, of course, a difference of about a year and a half
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.060]   and lifespan is remarkable.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.180]   - It doesn't even translate to that.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.320]   So taking a step back, type 2 diabetes on average
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.720]   will shorten your life by six years.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.240]   So that's the actuarial difference
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.260]   between having type 2 diabetes and not all comers.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.900]   But you're right, this is not a huge difference.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.000]   It's only a difference of a little less
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.540]   than one year of life per 1,000 patient years studied.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.620]   - Okay, and by the way, up here, just point out,
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.980]   my math was wrong when I said about a year and a half.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.720]   - But the point here is you would expect
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.080]   the people in the metformin group
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.800]   to have a far worse outcome,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.720]   i.e. to have a far worse crude death rate.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.400]   And the fact that it was statistically significant
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.680]   in the other direction,
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.320]   and it turned out on what's called
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.920]   the Cox proportional hazard,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.320]   which is where you actually model
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   the difference in lifespan.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.040]   The people who took metformin and had diabetes
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.640]   had a 15%, one five, 15% relative reduction
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.560]   in all-cause death over 2.8 years,
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.600]   which was the median duration of follow-up
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.440]   compared to the non-group. - Well, that seems to be
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.520]   the number that makes me go, wow.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.360]   - Yeah.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.640]   - Because, could you repeat those numbers again?
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.360]   - Yeah, so 15% reduction in all-cause mortality
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.640]   over 2.8 years.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.000]   - That's a big deal.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   - It is, and again, there's no clear explanation for it
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.720]   unless you believe that metformin is doing something
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.040]   beyond helping you lower blood glucose,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.640]   because the difference in blood glucose
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.200]   between these two people was still in favor
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.480]   of the non-diabetics.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.600]   So again, the proponents of metformin
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.200]   being a giroprotective agent,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.560]   and I put myself in this category at one point,
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.360]   I would put myself today in the category of undecided,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.900]   but at the time, I very much believed
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.640]   this was a very good suggestion
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.740]   that metformin was doing other things.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.400]   You mentioned a couple already.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.840]   Metformin is a weak inhibitor of mTOR.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.080]   Metformin reduces inflammation.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.420]   Metformin potentially tamps down on senescent cells
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.320]   and their secretory products.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.840]   There are lots of things metformin could be doing
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.940]   that are off target,
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.320]   and it might be that those things
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.440]   are conferring the advantage.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.040]   - As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.480]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.800]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.640]   that's designed to meet
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.860]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.480]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.780]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.040]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.720]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.680]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.440]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.600]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.400]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.940]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.160]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.960]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.740]   "If you could take just one supplement, what would it be?"
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.420]   I answer, "AG1."
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.120]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.600]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.360]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.000]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.460]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.260]   - So fast forward until a year ago,
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.640]   and I think most people took the Bannister study
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   as kind of the best evidence we have for the benefits
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.160]   of metformin, and I'm sure you've had lots of people
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.840]   come up to you and ask you, "Should I be on metformin?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.680]   "Should I be on metformin?"
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.520]   I mean, I probably get asked that question
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.220]   almost as much as I'm asked any question, outside of dew.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.360]   I mean, people definitely wanna know
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.620]   if you should be consuming dew,
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.160]   but after that, it's metformin.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.040]   - Fresh off the leaves.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.880]   - Has to be.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.540]   - While viewing morning sunlight.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.200]   - So okay, so let's kind of fast forward to now the paper
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.800]   that I wanted to spend a few more minutes on.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.880]   - Yeah, and thanks for that background.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   I'm still dazzled by the insertion of the straw
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.560]   by way of insulin.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.320]   I don't think I've ever heard that described.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.920]   I need to go get a better textbook.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.720]   - It's a pretty short straw, in fairness.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.760]   You know, it's just a little transport.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.960]   - Just to give people a sense of why I'm so dazzled by it,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   I am always fascinated by how quickly, how efficiently,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   and how specifically biology can create
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.880]   these little protein complexes
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.840]   that do something really important.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.680]   I mean, you're talking about an on-demand creation
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.480]   of a portal, right?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.980]   I mean, these are cells engineering their own machinery
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.920]   in real time in response to chemical signals.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.120]   - But remind me.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   - It's great.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.280]   - Yeah, but I'm sort of rusty on my neuroscience,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.240]   but an action potential works in reverse the same way.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   Like you need the ATP gradient to restore the gradient.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.380]   But once the action potential fires,
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.180]   it's passive outside, right?
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.740]   - Yeah, so what Pierre's referring to is
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.940]   the way that neurons become electrically active
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.700]   is by the flow of ions from the outside of the cell
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.540]   to the inside of the cell.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.580]   And we have both active conductances,
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.260]   meaning they're triggered by electrical changes
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.740]   in the gradients, by changes in electrical potential.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.820]   And then there are passive gradients
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.220]   where things can just flow back and forth
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.280]   until there's a balance equal inside and outside the cell.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.320]   I think what's different is that there's some movement
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.520]   of a lot of stuff inside of neurons
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.800]   when neurotransmitters like dopamine binds to its receptor
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.060]   and then a bunch of, it's like a bucket brigade
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.740]   that gets kicked off internally.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.340]   But it's not often that you hear about receptors
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.260]   getting inserted into cells very quickly.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.640]   Normally you have to go through a process
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.600]   of transcribing genes and making sure
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.980]   that the specific proteins are made.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.900]   And then those are long, slow things that take place
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.620]   over the course of many hours or days.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.760]   What you're talking about is a real on-demand insertion
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.180]   of a channel. - Yeah, it works in minutes.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.140]   - And it makes sense as to why that would be required,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.660]   but it's just, oh, so very cool.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.620]   - It's cool, yeah.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.500]   So Keys and colleagues came along and said,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.220]   "We would like to redo the entire banister analysis."
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.660]   And I think their motivation for it was
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.140]   the interest in this topic is through the roof.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.860]   There is a clinical trial called the TAME trial
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.420]   that is, I think, pretty much funded now
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.820]   and may be getting underway soon.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.620]   The TAME trial, which is an important trial,
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.340]   is going to try to ask this question prospectively
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.060]   and through random assignment.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.980]   - So this is the Targeting Aging with Metformin trial?
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.820]   - That's correct.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.820]   Near Barzilai is probably the senior PI on that.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.120]   And I think in many ways, the banister study,
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.880]   along with some other studies,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.060]   but of lesser significance,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.040]   probably provided some of the motivation for the TAME trial.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.820]   So they said, "Okay, look, we're gonna do this.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.580]   We're gonna use a different cohort of people."
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.580]   So the first study that we just talked about,
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.780]   the banister study used, I believe it was,
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.060]   roughly they sampled 95,000 subjects from a UK biobank.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.760]   Here, they used a larger sample.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.700]   They did about half a million people sampled
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.500]   from a Danish health registry.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.340]   And they did something pretty elegant.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.380]   They created two groups to study.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.100]   So the first was just a standard replication
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.880]   of what banister did, which was just a group of people
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.860]   with and without diabetic that they tried to match
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.280]   as perfectly as possible.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.300]   But then they did a second analysis in parallel
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.260]   with discordant twins.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.900]   So same-sex twins that only differed
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.500]   in that one had diabetes and one didn't.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.740]   I thought this was very elegant
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.460]   because here you have a degree of genetic similarity
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.180]   and you have similar environmental factors during childhood
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.140]   that might give you, allow you to see
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.820]   if there's any sort of difference in signal.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.180]   So now turning this back into a little bit
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.420]   of a journal club, virtually any clinical paper
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.860]   you're gonna read, table one is the characteristics
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   of the people in the study.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.160]   You always wanna take a look at that.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.480]   So when I look at table one here, you can see it's,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.400]   and by the way, just for people watching this,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.440]   we're gonna make all these papers and figures available.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.900]   So if you're, don't, we'll have nice show notes
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.820]   that'll make all this clear.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.180]   So table one in the keys paper
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.220]   shows the baseline characteristics.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.960]   And again, it's almost always gonna be the first table
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.800]   in a paper.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.540]   Usually the first figure in the paper is a study design.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.600]   It's usually a flow chart that says,
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.500]   these were the inclusion criteria.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.140]   These are all the people that got excluded.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.900]   This is how we randomized, et cetera.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.380]   And you can see here that there are four columns.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.860]   So the first two are the singletons.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.520]   These are people who are not related.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.380]   And then the second two are the twins who are matched.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.580]   And you can see, remember how I said they sampled
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.320]   about 500,000 people?
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.500]   You can see the numbers.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.240]   So they got, you know, 7,842 singletons on metformin,
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.780]   the same number then they pulled out,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.220]   matched without diabetes.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.860]   On the twins, they got 976 on metformin with diabetes.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.500]   And then by definition, 976 co-twins without them.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.740]   And you look at all these characteristics.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.540]   What was their age upon entry?
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.860]   How many were men?
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.500]   What was the year of indexing when we got them?
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.200]   What medications were they on?
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.860]   What was their highest level of education,
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.680]   marital status, et cetera?
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.460]   The one thing I want to call out here
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.540]   that really cannot be matched in a study like this,
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.740]   so this is a very important limitation, is the medication.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.780]   So look at that column, Andrew.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.500]   Notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.860]   until you get to the medication list.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.980]   - Yeah, it's all over the place.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.420]   - Yeah, it's just, it's not even close.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.700]   They're nowhere near matched, right?
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.420]   In other words, just to give you a couple of examples,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.160]   right, on the, and let's just talk about the singletons,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.860]   'cause it's basically the same story on the twins.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.460]   If you look at what fraction of the people
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.860]   with type 2 diabetes are on lipid-lowering medication,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   it's 45.6% versus 15.4% in the matched without diabetes.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.180]   It's a 3X difference.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.800]   What about antiplatelet therapy?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.220]   That's 30% versus 14%.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.380]   Antihypertensive, 65% versus 63% versus 31%.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.220]   - Because people who have one health issue
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.620]   and are taking metformin are likely
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.660]   to have other health issues.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.620]   - Exactly.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.980]   So this is, again, a fundamental flaw of epidemiology.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.820]   You can never remove all the confounders.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.300]   - This is why I became an experimental scientist,
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.060]   so that we could control variables.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.260]   - That's right, because without random assignment,
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.100]   you cannot control every variable.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.860]   Now you'll see in a moment when we get into the analysis,
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.200]   they go through three levels of corrections,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.740]   but they can never correct this medication one.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.220]   So just keep that in the back of your mind.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.740]   Okay, so the two big things that were done
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.260]   in this experiment, or in this survey, or study,
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.500]   to differentiate it from Bannister was, one,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.100]   the twin trick, which I think is pretty cool.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.960]   The second thing that they did was they did
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.560]   a sensitivity analysis with and without
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.340]   informative censoring.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.860]   So one of the other things they wanted to know was,
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.420]   hey, does it really matter if we don't count
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.420]   the metformin patients who progress?
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.620]   So let's see kind of what transcribed.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.340]   So the next figure, figure two,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.180]   pardon me, the next table, table two,
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.460]   walks you through the crude mortality rate
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.160]   in each of the groups.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.740]   So the most important row, I think, in this table
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.800]   is the one that says crude mortality
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.940]   per thousand person years.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.780]   Now you recall that in the previous study,
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.060]   in the Bannister study, those were on the ballpark
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.100]   about 15 per.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.740]   Okay, so let's look at each of these.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:34.580]   So in the single, the singletons, without,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.660]   so the non-twins who were not diabetic,
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.740]   it was 16.86.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.700]   - And could you put a little more contour
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.460]   on what this thousand person years?
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.300]   - What it is?
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   - Are you talking about pooling the lifespans
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.100]   of a bunch of different people until you get
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.540]   to the number 1,000?
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.540]   - Yeah, because this-- - Because you're normalizing,
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.380]   so it's not who's gonna live a thousand years,
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.940]   'cause no one's expecting that.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.720]   You're essentially taking, so you've got some people
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.660]   that are gonna live 76 years, 52 years, 91 years,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.300]   and you're pooling all of those until you hit a thousand.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.540]   And then that becomes kind of a,
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.060]   it's like a normalized division.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.220]   You're basically like, so let's say the control group,
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.700]   you're asking if there were a thousand person years
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.740]   available to live, how likely is it that this person
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.700]   would live another 15 years?
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.220]   - Yeah, so a couple of ways to think about it.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.320]   So taking a step back, we always have to have
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.420]   some way of normalizing.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.060]   So when we talk about the mortality from a disease
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.620]   like cancer in the population, we report it as
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.940]   what's the mortality rate per,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.860]   and it's typically per 100,000 persons.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.500]   - Okay, that's a much more intuitive way to express it.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.460]   - It is, but the reason we can do it that way
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.420]   is because we're literally looking at how many people died
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.660]   this calendar year, and we divide it by the number
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.820]   of people in that age group.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.100]   So it's typically what you're doing when you look
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.160]   at aged groups in buckets of like decades.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.600]   So that's why we can say the highest mortality
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.580]   is like people 90 and up.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.100]   Even though the absolute number of deaths is small,
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.560]   it's because there's not that many people there, right?
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.020]   The majority of deaths in absolute terms probably occur
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.140]   in the seventh decade, but as you go up,
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.860]   because the denominator is shrinking,
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.100]   you have to normalize to it.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.960]   So we just normalize to the number of people.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.760]   Here are all the people that started the year.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.180]   Here are all the people that ended the year.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.140]   What's the death rate?
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.200]   Why are these done in a slightly more complicated way?
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.620]   Because we don't follow these people for their whole lives.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.820]   We're only following them for a period of observation,
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.060]   in this case, roughly three years.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.500]   So to say something like we have a crude death rate
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.980]   of five deaths per thousand person years,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.960]   one way to think about that is if you had a thousand people
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.580]   and you followed them for one year,
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.560]   you'd expect five to die.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.220]   If you had 500 people and you followed them for two years,
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.420]   you expect five to die.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.700]   If you have a thousand people and you follow them
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.740]   for one year, you expect five to die.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.940]   Those would all be considered equivalent mortalities.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.300]   - Great, thank you for clarifying that.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.220]   - No, no, this stuff is, I mean,
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.180]   like I find epidemiology, when you get in the weeds,
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.120]   is way more complicated than following the basics
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.460]   of experimental stuff, where you just,
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.660]   you get to push all this stuff into the garbage bin
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.900]   and just say, hey, we're gonna take this number of people,
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.100]   we're gonna exclude this group, we're gonna randomize,
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:33.980]   we're gonna see what happens.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.200]   - Yeah, that's what, like the paper we'll talk about next.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.700]   - Yep, yep.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.940]   So when you adjust for age,
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.600]   and they don't show it in this table, it's only in the text,
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.800]   when you adjust for age, a very important check to do
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.280]   is what is the crude death rate of the people on metformin
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.460]   who are not twins versus who are twins.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.000]   Now in this table, they look different,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.320]   because it's 24.93 for the metformin group
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.900]   and 21.68 for the twin group that's on metformin.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.320]   When you adjust for age, they're almost identical.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   It goes from 24.93 to 24.7.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.220]   One other point I'll make here for people
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.740]   who are gonna be looking at this table is,
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.100]   you'll notice there are parentheses
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.540]   after every one of these numbers.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.460]   What does that offer in there?
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.820]   Those parentheses are offering the 95% confidence interval.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.180]   So for example, to take the number 24.93
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.060]   is the crude death rate of how many people are dying
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.420]   who take metformin.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.300]   What it's telling you is we're 95% confident
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.700]   that the actual number is between 23.23 and 26.64.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:49.600]   If a 95% confidence interval does not cross the number zero,
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.920]   it's statistically significant.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.960]   Okay, so the first thing that just jumps out at you,
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   I think when you look at this,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.000]   is there's clearly a difference here
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.640]   between the people who have diabetes and those who don't.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.000]   It complicates the study a little bit,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.240]   'cause it's basically two studies in one,
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.200]   but you're comparing 95, pardon me,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   24.93 to 16.86, which by the way remains after age adjustment
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.280]   when you go to the twin group, it's 24.73 to 12.94.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.780]   - So maybe just to zoom out for that,
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.760]   what you're describing, if I understand correctly,
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   is this crude deaths per 1000 person years,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.340]   let's just talk about the singletons, the non-twins,
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.660]   is 16.86, so 16.86 people die,
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.500]   and some people are probably thinking,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.520]   "How can 0.86 of a person die?"
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.100]   Well, it's not always whole numbers,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.380]   but there's a bad joke to be made here, but--
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.460]   - Yeah, just call it 17 versus 25.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.460]   - Right, 17 deaths per 1000 versus 25 deaths.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:58.340]   And the 25 is in the folks that took metformin.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.140]   Now, that to the naive listener and to me means,
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.460]   oh, metformin basically kills you, right?
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.340]   Not faster, or you're more likely to die,
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.840]   but we have to remember that these people have another,
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.020]   they have a major health issue
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.640]   that the other group does not have.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.480]   - That's right.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.140]   - Because people weren't assigned drug or not assigned drug.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.780]   It wasn't placebo drug.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.720]   It's let's look at people taking this drug
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.880]   for a bad health issue and compare to everyone else.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.220]   - That's right.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.540]   So now you have to go into,
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.380]   and I'll just sort of skip the next figure,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.900]   but the next figure is a Kaplan-Meier curve.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.460]   I think it's actually worth looking at it
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.020]   'cause they show up in all sorts of studies.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.260]   So if you look at figure one, it's a Kaplan-Meier curve,
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.500]   which is a mortality curve.
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:50.420]   So you'll see these in any study that is looking at death.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.380]   And this can be prospective randomized,
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.660]   this can be retrospective,
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.740]   but these are always gonna show up.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.340]   And I think it's really worth understanding
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.220]   what a Kaplan-Meier curve shows you.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.540]   So on the X-axis is always time and on the Y-axis
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.060]   is always the cumulative survival.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.980]   So it's a curve that always goes from zero to one,
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.920]   one or 100%, and it's always decreasing monotonically,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.820]   meaning it can only go down or stay flat.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.660]   It can never go back up.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.340]   So that's what a cumulative mortality curve looks like.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.560]   - Now we're looking at, you're starting it alive
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.700]   and you're looking at how many people die
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.020]   for every year that passes.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.340]   - That's right.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.660]   And in each curve, there's one on the left,
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.380]   which is the matched singletons,
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.260]   and there's the one on the right,
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.140]   which are the discordant twins.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.360]   You have two lines.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.780]   You have those that were on metformin with type 2 diabetes
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.180]   and you have their matched controls.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.580]   And in this figure, the matched controls
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.540]   are the darker lines and the people with type 2 diabetes
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.060]   on metformin, that's the lighter line.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.460]   You'll also notice, and I like the way they've done it here,
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.500]   they've got shading around each one.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.820]   And we should mention for those that are just listening
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.980]   that in both of these graphs,
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.460]   the downward trending line from the controls,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.220]   so again, non-diabetic, not taking metformin,
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   is above the line corresponding to the diabetics
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.500]   who are taking metformin.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:22.620]   Put crudely, the people who are taking metformin
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.860]   that have diabetes are dying at a faster rate
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.320]   for every single year examined.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.740]   The two lines do not overlap except at the beginning
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.860]   when everyone's alive.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.420]   It's like a foot race where basically the people
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.900]   with metformin and diabetes are falling behind
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.740]   and dying as they fall.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.460]   - That's right, and I'm glad you brought up a good point.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.440]   It's not uncommon in treatments
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.140]   to see Kaplan-Meier curbs cross.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.980]   They don't have to.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.140]   It's not a requirement that they never cross.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.020]   It's only a requirement
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.140]   that they're monotonically decreasing or staying flat.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.540]   So I've seen cancer treatment drugs
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.540]   where they have two drugs going head-to-head
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:53:59.500]   in a cancer treatment,
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.960]   and one starts out looking really, really bad,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.580]   but then all of a sudden it kind of flattens
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.900]   while the other one goes bad,
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.240]   and then it actually crosses and goes underneath.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.400]   But that's not the case here.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.240]   So to your point, the people with diabetes taking metformin
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.100]   in both the matched singletons and the discordants
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:21.060]   are dropping much faster, and they always stay below.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.840]   And I was just gonna say that the shading
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.320]   is just showing you a 95% confidence interval.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.540]   So you're just putting basically error bars along this.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.420]   So if this were experimental data,
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.980]   if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.180]   and you were watching their survival,
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.880]   and you'd have error bars on this
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.060]   which you're actually measuring.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.500]   So this is, because you have much more data here,
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.800]   you're just showing this in this fashion.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.600]   - For those that haven't been familiar as to statistics,
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.800]   no problem, error bars correspond to,
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.340]   like if you were just gonna measure the heights
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.460]   of a room full of 10th graders,
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.600]   there's gonna be a range, right?
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.460]   You have the very tall kid and the very shorter kid,
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.140]   and you have the short kid and the medium kid.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.080]   And so there's a range.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.460]   There's gonna be an average, a mean,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.400]   and then there'll be standard deviations and standard errors.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.180]   And so these confidence intervals
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.240]   just give a sense of how much range.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.580]   Some people die early, some people die late.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.740]   Within a given year, they're gonna be different ages.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.020]   So these error bars can account
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.560]   for a lot of different forms of variability.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.700]   Here, you're talking about the variability
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.860]   is how many people in each group die.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.440]   We're not tracking one diabetic taken metformin
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   versus a control.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.900]   I should have asked this earlier, but--
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.660]   - Well, and it's also a mathematical model
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.220]   at this point too that's smoothing it out.
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.400]   'Cause notice it's running for the full eight years,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.160]   even though they're only following people for,
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.900]   you know, typically, I think the median
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.980]   was like three or four years at a time.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.580]   So they're using this quite complicated type of mathematics
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.140]   called a Cox proportional hazard,
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.420]   which is what generates hazard ratios.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.180]   And basically, any model has to have some error in it.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.420]   And so they're basically saying this is the error.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   So you could argue when you look at that figure,
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.820]   we don't know exactly where the line is in there,
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.900]   but we know it's in that shaded area.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.800]   Sorry, one other point.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.900]   If those shaded areas overlapped,
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.400]   you couldn't really make the conclusion.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.140]   You wouldn't know for sure
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.660]   that one is different from the other.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.180]   - Yeah, that's actually a good opportunity
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.340]   to raise a common myth,
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.380]   which is a lot of people, when they look at a paper,
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:31.380]   let's say it's a bar graph, you know,
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.460]   and they see these error bars,
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.660]   and they will say, people often think,
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.980]   oh, if the error bars overlap,
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.020]   it's not a significant difference.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.940]   But if the error bars don't overlap,
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.260]   meaning there's enough separation,
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.900]   then that's a real and meaningful difference.
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.580]   And that's not always the case.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.120]   It depends a lot on the form of the experiment.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.760]   I often see some of the more robust Twitter battles
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.880]   over how people are reading graphs.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.480]   And I think it's important to remember
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.360]   that you run the statistics,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:02.160]   hopefully the correct statistics for the sample,
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.140]   but determining significance,
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.960]   whether or not the result could be due
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.760]   to something other than chance.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.040]   Of course, your confidence in that increases
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.960]   as it becomes typically p-values,
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   p less than 0.00001% chance that it's due to chance, right?
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.680]   So very low probably, p less than 0.05
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.500]   tends to be the kind of gold standard cutoff.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.600]   But when you're talking about data like these,
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.480]   which are repeated measures over time,
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:32.120]   people are dropping out literally over time,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.440]   you're saying they've modeled it to make predictions
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.420]   as to what would happen.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.200]   We're not necessarily looking at raw data points here.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.520]   - Yeah, the raw data was in the previous table.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.340]   That's now taken and run through this Cox model,
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.620]   and it's smoothed out.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.720]   And to your point about the bar graphs,
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.500]   yeah, I think the other thing you always wanna understand
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.880]   is just because something
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.840]   doesn't achieve statistical significance,
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.360]   the only way you can say it's not significant
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.060]   is you have to know what it was powered to detect.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.740]   And statistical power is a very important concept
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.880]   that probably doesn't get discussed enough.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.160]   But before you do an experiment,
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.300]   you have to have an expectation
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.600]   of what you believe the difference is between the groups.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.420]   And you have to determine the number of samples
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.720]   you will need to assess whether or not
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.300]   that difference is there or not.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   So you use something, it's called a power table,
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.840]   and you would go to the power table.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.600]   So if you're doing treatment A versus treatment B,
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.260]   and you say, well, look, I think treatment A
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.880]   is going to have a 50% response,
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.620]   and I think treatment B will have a 65% response.
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.160]   You literally go to a power table that says 50% response,
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.080]   15% difference, that gives you a place on the grid,
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.120]   and I wanna be 90% sure that I'm right, so 90% power.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.080]   I'm being a little bit,
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.680]   so there's gonna be a statistician listening to this
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.880]   who's gonna wanna kill me,
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.440]   but this is directionally the way we would describe it.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.680]   And that tells you this is how many animals or people
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.220]   you would need in this study.
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.640]   You're gonna need 147 in each group.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.320]   And by the way, if you now do the experiment with 147
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.440]   and you fail to find significance,
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.900]   you can comfortably say there is no statistical difference
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.080]   at least up to that 15%.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.120]   There may be a difference at 10%,
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.460]   but you weren't powered to look at 10%.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.120]   - Yeah, and very important point that you're making.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.340]   Another point that's just a more general one
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.680]   about statistics, in general,
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.280]   the way to reduce variability in a data set
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.040]   is to increase sample size.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.000]   And that kinda makes sense, right?
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.040]   If I just walk into a 10th grade class and go,
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.480]   hey, I'm gonna measure height,
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.400]   and I look up by the first three kids that I see,
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.880]   and I happen to look over there,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.120]   and it's the three that all play
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.240]   on the volleyball team together.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.960]   My sample size is small,
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.080]   and I'm likely to get a skewed representation,
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.040]   in this case, taller than average.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.320]   So increasing sample size tends to decrease variation.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.000]   So that's why when you hear about a study
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.920]   from the UK Biobank or from half a million Danish citizens,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.000]   like for instance, in this study,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.880]   those are enormous sample sizes.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.060]   So even though this is not an experimental study,
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.460]   it's an epidemiological observational study,
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.920]   there's tremendous power by way of the enormous number
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.760]   of subjects in this study.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.060]   - And that's the way that epidemiology
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.760]   will make up for its deficit.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.160]   So you could never do a randomized assignment study
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.540]   on half a million people.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:36.740]   So epidemiology makes up for its biggest limitation,
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.460]   which is it can never compensate for inherent biases
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.300]   by saying we can do infinite duration if we want,
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.320]   like we could survey people over the course of their lives,
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.520]   and we can have the biggest sample size possible,
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.560]   'cause this is relatively cheap.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.420]   The cost of actually doing an experiment
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.400]   where you have tens of thousands of people is prohibitive.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.920]   I mean, if you look at the Women's Health Initiative,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.640]   which was a five-year study on, I don't know,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.140]   what was it, 50,000 women,
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.360]   I mean, that was a billion-dollar study.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.320]   So this is the balancing act between epidemiology
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.160]   and randomized prospective experiments.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.740]   And so they both offer something,
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.720]   but you just have to know the blind spots of each one.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.840]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.520]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.880]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.380]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.920]   to help you better understand your body
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.820]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.140]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.460]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.680]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.260]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.300]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.180]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.320]   about hormones, and so on,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.340]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.640]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.400]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.320]   that is, to understand what those lipids,
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.300]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.480]   and behavioral, supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.280]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.560]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.840]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.480]   of both ApoB and of insulin, which are key indicators
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.280]   of cardiovascular health and energy regulation.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.720]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.520]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.300]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.300]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.640]   - So let's just kind of wrap this up.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.560]   I mean, I think let's just go to table four,
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.280]   which I think is the most important table in here,
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.320]   which now lays out the final results
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.840]   in terms of the hazard ratio.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.360]   So this is the way we wanna really be thinking about this.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.000]   So again, hazard ratios,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.600]   these are important things to understand.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.440]   A hazard ratio is a number,
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.500]   and you always subtract one from the hazard ratio,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.200]   and that tells you, if it's a positive number,
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.040]   if it's a number, sorry,
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.960]   if it's a number greater than one, you subtract one,
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.400]   and that tells you the relative harm.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.240]   So if the hazard ratio is 1.5,
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.700]   you subtract 1.5 is a 50% increase in risk.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.160]   If the number is negative,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.000]   you may recall on the Bannister paper,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.080]   the hazard ratio was 0.85.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.200]   So that means it's a 15% reduction in relative risk,
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.340]   and here you can see all the hazard ratios are positive.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.340]   So what it's telling you here is,
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.260]   and I'm gonna walk through this
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.080]   'cause there's a lot of information packed here.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.880]   You've got singletons, you've got twins.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.520]   They're showing you three different ways that they do it.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   They do an unadjusted model.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.040]   If you just look at the singletons
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.720]   with and without metformin and you make no adjustments,
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.620]   the hazard ratio is 1.48,
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.960]   meaning the people on metformin had a 48% greater chance
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.200]   of dying in any given year
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   than their non-diabetic counterpart.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.280]   - The only reason I'm smiling,
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.600]   it's not 'cause I enjoy people dying quite to the contrary,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.640]   is that this is novel for me,
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.720]   and that I've read some epidemiological studies before,
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.160]   but it's not normally where I spend the majority of my time.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.400]   But up until now, I was thinking,
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.280]   okay, people taking metformin are dying more
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.120]   than those that aren't,
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   and I'm just relieved to know
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.700]   that I wasn't looking at all this backwards, okay?
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.800]   So they're dying more,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.740]   but of course, we don't have a group
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.760]   that's taking metformin who doesn't have diabetes,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   and we don't have a group who has diabetes
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.480]   and is taking metformin plus something else.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.040]   So again, we're only dealing with these
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.240]   constrained populations.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.260]   - Yeah, now there's another arm to this study
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.680]   that I'm not getting into 'cause it adds more complexity,
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.580]   which is they also have another group
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.880]   that's got diabetes, takes metformin,
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.120]   and takes sulfonylureas, which is a bigger drug,
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120]   and those people die even more.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.440]   - Whoa, so how?
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.280]   - Which again, speaks to the point, right?
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.920]   The more you need these medications,
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.700]   they're never able to erase the effect of diabetes.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.120]   - But in this case, it seems that they might be accelerating,
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.920]   possibly accelerating death due to diabetes, possibly.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.880]   - We could never know that from this
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.100]   because we don't see,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.760]   we would need to see diabetics who don't take metformin,
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.840]   who take nothing,
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.200]   and I would bet that they would do even worse.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.960]   So my intuition is that the metformin is helping,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.780]   but not helping nearly as much as we thought before.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.240]   So my point is they make another set of adjustments.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.160]   They say, okay, well look, in the first one,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.720]   in the unadjusted model, we only matched for age and gender.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.280]   Okay, that's pretty crude.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.200]   What if we adjust for the medications they're on,
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.820]   cardiovascular, psychiatric, pulmonary, dementia, meds,
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.900]   and marital status?
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.400]   I don't know why they threw marital status in there,
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.240]   but they did.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.200]   - I don't know, maybe being married or unmarried can--
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   - I'm sure it can, but it just seems like a random thing
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.220]   to throw in with all their meds.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.340]   I would have personally done that adjustment higher up,
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.580]   but nevertheless, if you do that,
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:48.580]   all of a sudden the hazard ratio drops from 1.48 to 1.32,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:52.700]   which means, yep, you still have a 32% greater chance
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.920]   of dying in any given year.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.880]   All right, what if we also adjust for the highest level
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.380]   of education along with any of the other covariates?
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.880]   Well, that doesn't really change it at all.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.160]   It ends up at 1.33, or a 33% chance increase in death.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.480]   - I always knew that more school wasn't gonna save me.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.720]   - It's not doing jack.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.800]   So now let's do it for the twins.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.760]   If you do the twin study, which you could argue
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.920]   is a slightly purer study, because you at least have
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.940]   one genetic and environmental thing that you've attached,
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.520]   the unadjusted model is brutal, 2.15.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.620]   That's 115%.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.460]   Think about this.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:33.020]   These are twins who, in theory, are the same in every way,
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.980]   except one has diabetes and one doesn't,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.960]   and the one with diabetes on metformin still has 115%
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.780]   greater chance of dying than the non-diabetic co-twin.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.140]   When you make that first adjustment of all the meds
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:48.060]   and marital status, you bring it down to a 70% increase
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.180]   in risk, and when you throw education in,
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.100]   it goes up to an 80% chance of risk.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.400]   Now, they did this really cool thing,
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.060]   which was they did the analysis
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.140]   on with and without censoring.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:04.900]   So everything I just said here was based on no censoring.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.020]   - Tell me about censoring.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.780]   - Censoring is when you stop counting the metformin people
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:09.620]   who have died.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:15.580]   Okay, so in the singleton group, when you unadjust it,
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.620]   and the reason I'm doing the unadjusted is that's where
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.280]   they did the sensitivity analysis.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.260]   I don't think it really matters that much.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.360]   You just have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.580]   You'll recall that that was a 48% chance
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.700]   of increased mortality, all-cause mortality,
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:34.220]   if you stop counting, pardon me, if you don't censor,
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.300]   meaning if you include everybody,
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.020]   including when people on metformin with diabetes die.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:43.020]   If you censor them, it comes down to 1.39.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.560]   In other words, this is a very important finding,
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.640]   it did not undo the benefits that we saw
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.540]   in the Bannister study.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.140]   Bannister saw a 15% reduction in mortality
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.140]   when they censored.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:02.860]   When keys censored, it got better, but not that much better.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.820]   It went from 48 to 39%.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.820]   In the twins, it went from 115% down to only 97%.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:17.140]   So in some ways, this presents a little bit of an enigma,
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.280]   because it's not entirely clear to me,
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.360]   having read these papers many times,
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.680]   exactly why Bannister found such an outline,
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.020]   like such a different response.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.220]   There's another technical detail of this paper,
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.160]   which is they, you can see on the right side of table four,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.540]   they did something called a nested case control.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.380]   But you'll see, and I was gonna go into a long explanation
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.340]   of what nested case controls are.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:45.500]   It's another pretty elegant way to do case control studies,
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.100]   where you sample by year and you sort of normalize,
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.180]   you don't count all the cases at the end,
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.980]   you count them one by one.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.560]   I don't think it's worth getting into, Andrew,
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.960]   'cause it doesn't change the answer.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.920]   You can see it changes it just slightly,
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.540]   but it doesn't change the point.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.380]   The point here is, the keys paper makes it undeniably clear
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.980]   that in that population, there was no advantage
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.900]   offered by metformin that undid the disadvantage
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.380]   of having type two diabetes.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.940]   This does not mean that metformin wasn't helping them,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.860]   because we don't know what these people would have been like
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.700]   without metformin.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.980]   It could be that this bought them a 50% reduction
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.920]   in relative mortality to where they'd been.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.900]   But what it says is, in a way,
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.680]   this is what you would have expected.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.100]   This is what you would have expected 10 years ago
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.740]   before the Bannister paper came out.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.860]   - Or maybe even before metformin was used,
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.900]   because in some ways it's saying,
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.600]   what is the likelihood that sick people
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.560]   who are on a lot of medication are gonna die
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.020]   compared to not sick people
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.920]   who aren't on a lot of medication?
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.760]   - Yep.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.940]   - One of, you know, it's not quite that simple
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.460]   in the sense that, as you said,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.380]   there are ways to try and isolate
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.740]   the metformin contribution somewhat,
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.380]   because they're on a bunch of other meds.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:04.140]   And presumably that was done and analyzed in other figures
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.340]   where they can sort of try and,
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.300]   they can never attach the results
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.660]   specifically to metformin, right?
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.480]   But there must be some way of weighting
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.200]   the percentage that are on psychiatric meds
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.480]   or not on psychiatric meds as some way to tease out
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.000]   whether or not there's actually
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.840]   some contribution in metformin to this result.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.540]   - Well, that's what they're doing in the partial adjustment,
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.560]   is they're actually doing their best to say-
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.760]   - Oh, right, married or not married,
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.600]   they're going variable by variable.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.640]   - They're going drug by drug all the way through,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.100]   high blood pressure, non-high blood pressure,
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.640]   smoking, nonsmoking, et cetera.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.080]   - Right, and the way they would do that, presumably,
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.800]   is by saying, okay, married, not married,
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.020]   that's a simple one.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.660]   - Are you on lipid lowering meds, yes or no?
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:50.340]   Okay, you are not, you are not.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.500]   - And then comparing those groups.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.500]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.120]   - So no differences jumping out
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.680]   that can be purely explained by these other variables.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.020]   - Yes, although, again, this is a great opportunity
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.140]   to talk about why, no matter how slick you are,
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.360]   no matter how slick your model is,
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.060]   you can't control for everything.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.000]   There is a reason that, to my knowledge,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.040]   virtually every study that compares meat eaters
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.480]   to non-meat eaters finds an advantage
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.120]   amongst the non-meat eaters.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   And we can talk about all the-
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   - Lifespan advantage.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.320]   - Yes, and we can, or disease incidence studies.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.400]   And yeah, it might be tempting to say,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.860]   well, therefore, eating meat is bad,
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.900]   until you realize that it takes a lot of work
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.960]   to not eat meat.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.600]   That's a very, very significant decision
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.760]   that a person, for most people,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.200]   that's a very significant decision a person makes.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.560]   And for a person to make that decision,
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.000]   they probably have a very high conviction
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.760]   about the benefit of that to their health.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.560]   And it is probably the case that they're making
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.320]   other changes with respect to their health as well
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.560]   that are a little more difficult to measure.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.280]   Now, there's a million other problems with that.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.440]   I picked a silly example,
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.160]   because the whole meat discussion then gets into,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.240]   well, when we say eating meat, what do we mean?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.080]   - Yeah, we're not talking about,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.600]   it's like deli meat versus grass-fed.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.440]   - Exactly.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.040]   - Or a deer that you hunted with your ball.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.000]   - That's right, so how do we get into all those things?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.120]   But my point is, it's very difficult to quantify
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.080]   some of the intangible differences.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.560]   And I think that even a study that goes to great lengths,
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.600]   as this one does, epidemiologically,
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.700]   to make these corrections can never make the corrections.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.360]   And so, for me, the big takeaway of this study is,
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.240]   one, this makes much more sense to me
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.160]   than the Bannister paper,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.060]   which never really made sense to me.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.460]   And again, I was first critical of the Bannister paper
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.320]   in 2018, about four years after comment.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   That's about the time I stopped taking Metformin, by the way.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.560]   I stopped taking it for a different reason,
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.320]   which we can talk about in a sec.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.060]   But that was the first time I went back and said,
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.680]   wait a minute, this information,
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.280]   this informative censoring thing is,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.520]   that's a little fishy.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.440]   And I think we weren't looking at a true group
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.600]   of real type 2 diabetics.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.240]   Now, that said, maybe it doesn't matter.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.520]   In other words, maybe, and even the Keys paper
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.880]   doesn't tell us that Metformin wouldn't be beneficial,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.580]   because it could be that those people,
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.360]   if they were on nothing,
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.720]   as their matched cohorts were on nothing,
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.960]   would have been dying at a hazard ratio of three,
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.400]   and this brought it down to 1.5,
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.280]   in which case you would say,
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.260]   there is some zero protection there.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.120]   It is putting the brakes on this process.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.360]   All of this is to say, absent a randomized control trial,
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.080]   we will never know the answer.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.280]   - Has there been a randomized control trial in Metformin?
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.640]   - Not when it comes to a hard outcome.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.840]   Now, there has been in the ITP.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.760]   So the Interventions Testing Program,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.120]   which is kind of the gold standard for animal studies,
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.960]   which is run out of three labs.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.300]   So it's an NIH funded program that's run out of three labs.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.300]   They basically test molecules for zero protection.
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.040]   The ITP was the first study
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.360]   that really put rapamycin on the map in 2009.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.840]   That was the study that's fortuitously demonstrated
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.960]   that even when rapamycin was given very, very late in life,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.280]   it was given to 60 month old mice.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.800]   It still afforded them a 15% lifespan extension.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.020]   - Has a similar study been done in humans?
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.160]   I mean, it's hard to,
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.040]   now we can't really control with rapamycin.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.760]   - No, but when the ITP studied Metformin,
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.400]   it did not succeed.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.960]   So there have not been that many drugs
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.980]   that have worked in the ITP.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.020]   The ITP is very rigorous, right?
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.540]   It doesn't use an inbred strain of mice.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:27.300]   It is done concurrently in three labs
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.360]   with very large sample sizing.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.980]   And so when something works in the ITP, it's pretty exciting.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.100]   Rapamycin has been studied several times.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.940]   It's always worked.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.620]   Another one we should talk about at a subsequent time
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.100]   is 17 alpha estradiol.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.760]   This continues to work in male mice
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.940]   and it produces comparable effects to rapamycin.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.780]   - Estrogen.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.600]   - Doesn't work in female rice.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.840]   But this is alpha, not beta.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.320]   This is 17 alpha estradiol, not beta estradiol,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.200]   which is the estradiol that we all,
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.880]   that is bioavailable in all of us.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.520]   - And just as a brief aside,
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.420]   I think you and I basically agree
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.340]   that unless it's a problem,
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.400]   males, we're talking post-puberty,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.560]   should try and have their estrogen as high as possible
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.200]   without having negative symptomology
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.340]   because of the importance of estrogen for libido,
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.080]   for brain function, tissue health, bone health.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.980]   This idea of crushing estrogen
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:25.080]   and raising testosterone is just silly, right?
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.760]   Let's just leave raising testosterone out of it.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.880]   But many of the approaches to raising testosterone
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.400]   that are pharmacologic in nature also raise estrogen.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.260]   A lot of people try and push down on estrogen.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.120]   And that is just, again,
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.600]   unless people are getting hyperestrogenic effects,
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.600]   like gynecomastia or other issues,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.160]   is the exact wrong direction to go.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.920]   You want estrogen high.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.120]   - Estrogen is a very important hormone for men and women.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.960]   - Yeah, that's good.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.160]   Canagaflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, also very successful
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.220]   in the ITP.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.240]   But again, interestingly, metformin not.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.920]   So metformin has failed in the ITP.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.560]   - So you no longer take metformin?
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.840]   - I stopped five years ago.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.760]   - I mean, you're not a diabetic,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.720]   so presumably you were taking it to buffer blood glucose
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.840]   in order to potentially live longer.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.740]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.080]   And the reason I stopped,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.720]   and this will be the last thing before we move on.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.280]   - Well, 'cause you couldn't go to the Dairy Queen
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.400]   at the buffet event.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.880]   - No, finally the nausea went away after a few weeks
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.840]   or a month maybe.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.680]   But once I got really into lactate testing,
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.400]   I noticed how high my lactate was at rest.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.980]   So a resting fasted lactate should be,
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.060]   in a healthy person, should be below one,
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.600]   like somewhere between 0.3, 0.6 millimole.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.280]   And only when you start to exercise should lactate go up.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.400]   And in 2018 was when I started blood testing
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.440]   for my zone two.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.720]   So previously, when I was doing zone two testing,
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.040]   I was just going off my power meter and heart rate.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.840]   But this is after I'd met Inigo San Milan
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.640]   and I started wanting to use the lactate threshold
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.840]   of two millimole as my determinant
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.360]   of where to put my wattage on the bike.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   And I'm like doing finger pricks before I start
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.920]   and I'm like 1.6 millimole.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.860]   And I'm like, "What the hell is going on?"
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.700]   I can't be 1.6--
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.900]   - This is if you ran a flight of stairs
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.540]   up the back of the Empire State Building.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.200]   - Well, no, that would put me a lot higher, right?
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.980]   And when I-- - I was being generous to your fitness.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.600]   - No, but that's when I started doing a little digging
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.720]   and realized, oh, you know what?
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.120]   This totally makes sense.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.660]   If you have a weak mitochondrial toxin,
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.960]   what are you gonna do?
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.440]   You're gonna shunt more glucose into pyruvate
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.040]   and more pyruvate into lactate.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.080]   I'm anaerobic at a baseline. - Yeah, you need
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.400]   an alternative fuel source.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.240]   - That's right.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.440]   And then my zone two numbers just seemed off.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.060]   My lactate seemed-- - Could you feel it?
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:45.900]   Sorry to interrupt. - No.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:46.800]   - Could you feel it in your body?
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.680]   'Cause maybe now I'll just briefly describe.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   I took berberine.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.920]   During the period of maybe,
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.640]   somewhere in the 2012 to 2015 stretch,
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.480]   I don't recall exactly.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.320]   - And what were you taking it for?
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.140]   - Well, I'll tell you.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.760]   So I was and I still am a big fan
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.940]   of Tim Ferriss's slow carbohydrate diet,
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.400]   because I like to eat meat and vegetables and starches.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.280]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.380]   And I found that it worked very quickly,
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.640]   got me very lean.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.760]   I could exercise, I could think, I could sleep.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.540]   You know, a lot of my rationale
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.840]   for following one eating regimen or another,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.880]   what I eat is to enjoy myself, but also have mental energy.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.060]   I mean, 'cause if I can't sleep at night,
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.480]   I'm not going to replenish.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.000]   If I don't replenish, I'm going to feel like garbage.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.800]   I don't care how lean I am or what, you know.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.900]   So I found the slow carb diet to be,
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.040]   which was in the four hour body,
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.120]   to be a very good plan for me.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.040]   It was pretty easy.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.800]   You drop some things like bread, et cetera.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.440]   You don't drink calories,
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.000]   except after a resistance training session, et cetera.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.680]   But one day a week, you have this so-called cheat day.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.760]   And on the cheat day, anything goes.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.040]   And so I would eat, you know, eight croissants,
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.480]   and then I'd alternate to sweet stuff,
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.320]   and then I'd go to a piece.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.140]   And by the end of the day,
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.120]   you don't want to look at an item of food at all.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.340]   So the only modification I made to the slow carb diet
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.280]   four hour body thing was the day after the cheat day,
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.120]   I wouldn't eat, I would just fast.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.380]   And I had no problem doing that
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.040]   because it was just basically,
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.680]   well, since you said, what was it, anal?
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.520]   - Anal seepage.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.840]   - Anal seepage, I did not have that.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.940]   But since you said that, I won't up the ante here,
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:19.620]   but I'll at least match your anal seepage comment by saying,
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.840]   I had, let's just call it profound gastric distress
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.120]   after eating like that the next day.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.400]   So the last thing you want to do is eat any food,
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400]   I would just hydrate,
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.560]   and oftentimes to try and get some exercise.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.920]   And what I read was that berberine,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.880]   poor man's metformin, could buffer blood glucose,
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.780]   and in some ways make me feel less sick
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.680]   when ingesting all these calories,
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.180]   and in many cases, spiking my blood sugar and insulin
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.120]   because you're having ice cream and et cetera.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.520]   And indeed it worked.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.680]   So if I took berberine,
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.780]   and I don't recall the milligram count,
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.600]   and then I ate 12 donuts, I felt fine.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.560]   It was as if I had eaten one donut.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.380]   I felt sort of okay in my body
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.280]   and I felt much, much better.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.520]   Now, presumably 'cause it's buffering
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.360]   the spikes in blood sugar,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.640]   I wasn't crashing in the afternoon nap and that whole thing.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.080]   - And do you remember how much you were taking?
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.480]   - I think it was a couple hundred milligrams.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.360]   Does that sound about right?
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.600]   It was a bright yellow capsule.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.800]   I forget the source.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.160]   But in any case, one thing I noticed was
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.240]   that if I took berberine and I did not ingest
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.040]   a profound number of carbohydrates very soon afterwards,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.420]   I got brutal headaches.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.840]   I think I was hypoglycemic.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.360]   I didn't measure it, but I just felt I had headaches.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.200]   I didn't feel good.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.000]   And then I would eat a pizza or two and feel fine.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.960]   And so I realized that berberine was putting me
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.280]   on this lower blood sugar state.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.840]   That was the logic anyway.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.720]   And it allowed me to eat these cheat foods.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.960]   But when I cycled off of the four out,
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.280]   'cause I don't follow the slow carb diet anymore,
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.100]   although I might again at some point.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.680]   When I stopped doing those cheat days,
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.920]   I didn't have any reason to take the berberine
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.900]   and I feared that I wasn't ingesting enough carbohydrates
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.320]   in order to really justify trying to buffer my blood glucose.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320]   Also, my blood glucose tends to be fairly low.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.160]   - Did you ever try Acarbos?
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.460]   - No, what is that?
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.300]   - So Acarbos is-
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.640]   - Another glucose disposal.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.100]   - Yeah, it's actually a drug that,
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.620]   but it works more in the gut
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.380]   and it just prevents glucose absorption.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.600]   Acarbos is another one of those drugs
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.820]   that actually found a survival benefit in the ITP.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:24.640]   And it was a very interesting finding
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.740]   because the thesis for testing it,
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.420]   the ITP is a very clever system.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.160]   Anybody can nominate a candidate to be tested.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.380]   Then the panel over there reviews it and they decide,
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.220]   yep, this is interesting.
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.040]   We'll go ahead and study it.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   When I think David Allison nominated Acarbos to be studied,
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.060]   the rationale was it would be a caloric restriction mimetic
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.800]   because you would literally just fail to absorb,
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.660]   I don't know, make up some number, right?
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.800]   15 to 20% of your carbohydrates would not be absorbed
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.960]   and therefore you would,
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.120]   the mice would effectively be calorically restricted.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.040]   - They would just pass them out.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:57.960]   - That's right.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.640]   And what happened was really interesting.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.400]   One, the mice lived longer on Acarbos,
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.880]   but two, they didn't weigh any less.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.320]   So they lived longer, but not through calorie restriction.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.160]   - That's interesting.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:11.980]   - Yes.
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:14.160]   And the speculation is they lived longer
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.200]   because they had lower glucose and lower insulin.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.720]   - And I don't want to send this down some rabbit holes here,
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.840]   but there are all sorts of interesting ideas about,
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:26.200]   for instance, that some forms of dementia
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.080]   might be so-called type three diabetes,
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.240]   the diabetes of the brain.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.200]   And so things like berberine metformin,
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.740]   lowering blood glucose, ketogenic diets, et cetera,
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.880]   might be beneficial there.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.600]   I mean, there's a lot to explore here
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   and I know you've explored a lot of that on your podcast.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.760]   I've done far less of that, but well,
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.420]   at least it seems that we know
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.480]   the following things for sure.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.520]   One, you don't want insulin too high, nor too low.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.480]   You don't want blood glucose too high, nor too low.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.560]   If the buffering systems for that are disrupted,
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.400]   clearly exercise, meaning regular exercise,
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.080]   is the best way to keep that system in check.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.520]   But in the absence of that tool,
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.580]   or I would say in addition to that tool,
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.480]   is there any glucose disposal agent,
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.840]   'cause that's what we're talking about here,
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.800]   metformin, berberine, A-CarboCit, et cetera,
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.040]   that you take on a regular basis
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.520]   because you have that much confidence in it?
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.620]   - The only one that I take is an SGLT2 inhibitor.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:25.020]   So this is a class of drug that is used
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.800]   by people with type two diabetes, which I don't have,
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.720]   but because of my faith in the mechanistic studies
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.660]   of this drug, coupled with its results in the ITP,
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.940]   coupled with the human trial results
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.980]   that show profound benefit in non-diabetics
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.720]   taking it even for heart failure,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.700]   I think there's something very special about that drug.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.060]   Actually, that was another paper
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.380]   I was thinking about presenting this time.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:47.700]   Maybe we'll do that the next time.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:51.720]   - But do you believe in caloric restriction
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.960]   as a way to extend life, or are you more of the,
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.540]   do the right behaviors, and that's covered
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:02.400]   in your book, "Outlive" and elsewhere on your podcast.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.660]   And buffer blood glucose, do you still,
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:09.000]   obviously you believe in buffering blood glucose
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.880]   in addition to just doing all the right behaviors.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.880]   - Yeah, I think you can uncouple a little bit
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.660]   the buffering of blood glucose from the caloric deficit.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.160]   So I think you can be in a reasonable energy balance
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.040]   and buffer glucose with good sleep hygiene,
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.000]   lots of exercise, and just thoughtful eating
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.160]   without having to go into a calorie deficit.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:32.840]   So it's not entirely clear if profound caloric restriction
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   would offer a survival advantage to humans
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.560]   even if it were tolerable to most, which it's not.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.980]   So for most people, it's just kind of off the table.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.180]   Like if I said, Andrew, you need to eat 30% fewer calories
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.560]   for the rest of your life.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.240]   - I'll live 30% fewer years, thank you.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.080]   - Yeah, there's just not many people
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.260]   who are willing to sign up for that.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.720]   So it's kind of a moot point.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.640]   But the question is, do you need to be fasting all the time?
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.800]   Do you need to be doing all of these other things?
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.400]   And the answer appears to be outside of using them as tools
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.060]   to manage energy balance, it's not clear, right?
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.600]   And energy balance probably plays a greater role
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.600]   in glucose homeostasis from a nutrition standpoint
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.480]   than the individual constituents of the meal.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.560]   Now that's not entirely true.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.920]   Like I can imagine a scenario where a person
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920]   could be in a negative energy balance
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.080]   eating Twix bars all day and drinking big gulps.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.540]   But I also don't think that's a very sustainable thing to do
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.580]   because if by definition, I'm gonna put you
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:37.040]   in negative energy balance consuming that much crap,
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.460]   I'm gonna destroy you.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.580]   Like you're gonna feel so miserable,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.800]   you're gonna be starving, right?
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.080]   You're not gonna be satiated eating pure garbage
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.540]   and being in caloric deficit.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.240]   You're gonna end up having to go into caloric excess.
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.600]   So that's why it's interesting thought experiment.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.320]   I don't think it's a very practical experiment.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.960]   For a person to be generally satiated
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.060]   and in energy balance, they're probably eating
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.760]   about the right stuff.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.600]   But I don't think that the specific macros matter
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.560]   as much as I used to think.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.640]   - I'm a believer in getting most of my nutrients
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.200]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   simply because it allows me to eat foods I like
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.160]   and more of them.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.200]   And I just love to eat.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.400]   I so physically enjoy the sensation of chewing
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.320]   that I'll just eat cucumber slices for fun, right?
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.680]   I mean, that's not my only form of fun fortunately.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:37.700]   This is an amazing paper for the simple reason
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.240]   that it provides a wonderful tutorial
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.720]   of the benefits and drawbacks of this type of work.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.200]   And I think it's also wonderful because we hear a lot
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.560]   about metformin, rapamycin,
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.940]   and these anti-aging approaches,
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:57.120]   but I was not aware that there was any study
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.860]   of such a large population of people.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.360]   So it's pretty interesting.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.560]   - Yeah, so I think it remains to be seen.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.260]   And my patients often ask me,
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.460]   "Hey, should I be on metformin?"
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.220]   And I give them a much, much, much, much shorter version
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.720]   of what we just talked about.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.340]   And I say, "Look, if the TAME study,"
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.920]   which should answer this question more definitively, right?
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.600]   This is taking a group of non-diabetics
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.680]   and randomizing them to placebo versus metformin
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:24.060]   and studying for specific disease outcomes,
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.860]   if the TAME study ends up demonstrating
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.640]   that there is a zero protective benefit of metformin,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.880]   I'll reconsider everything, right?
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.920]   So I think that's, we just have to,
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.280]   I think, all walk around with an appropriate degree
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.320]   of humility around what we know and what we don't know.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.160]   But I would say right now, the epidemiology,
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.040]   the animal data, my own personal experience
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.360]   with its impact on my lactate production
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.520]   and exercise performance,
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.480]   there's a whole other rabbit hole
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.400]   we could go down another time,
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.540]   which is the impact on hypertrophy and strength,
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:56.140]   which appears to be attenuated as well by metformin.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:01.320]   I still prescribe it to patients all the time
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.720]   if they're insulin resistant, for sure.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.280]   It's still a valuable drug,
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.860]   but I don't think of it as a great tool
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:09.180]   for the person who's insulin sensitive and exercising a lot.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:12.080]   - I can't help but ask this question.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.680]   Do you think there's any longevity benefit
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.280]   to short periods of caloric restriction?
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.340]   So for instance, I decide to,
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.600]   by the way, I haven't done this,
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.280]   but let's say I were to decide to fast
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.400]   and do a one meal a day type thing
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.240]   where I'm going to be in a slight caloric deficit,
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.000]   500 to 1,000 calories for a couple of days
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.640]   and then go back to eating the way that I ate before,
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.000]   that short caloric restriction/fast.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.120]   Is there any benefit to it in terms of cellular health?
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.620]   Can you sort of reset the system?
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:51.200]   Is there any idea that the changes,
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.240]   the clearing of senescent cells that we hear about,
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.920]   autophagy, that in the short term,
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.640]   you can glean a lot of benefits
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.140]   and then go back to your regular pattern of eating
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.320]   and then periodically, once every couple of weeks
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.160]   or once a month, just fast for a day or two.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.360]   Is there any benefit to that
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.440]   that's purely in the domain of longevity?
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.800]   Because there's all discipline function there,
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.120]   there's a flexibility function,
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.880]   there's probably an insulin sensitivity function,
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.040]   but is there any evidence that it can help us live longer?
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.040]   - I think the short answer is no, for two reasons.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.640]   One, I don't think that that duration would be sufficient
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.440]   if one is going to take that approach,
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.920]   but two, even if you went with something longer,
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.860]   like what I used to do, right?
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.160]   I used to do seven days of water only per quarter,
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.800]   three days per month.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.280]   So I was, basically always like it would be three day fast,
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.860]   three day fast, seven day fast.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.740]   Just imagine doing that all year, rotating, rotating,
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.860]   rotating, for many years I did that.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:51.280]   Now I certainly believed, and to this day I would say
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.000]   I have no idea if that provided a benefit,
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.440]   but my thesis was the downside of this
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.840]   is relatively circumscribed,
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.240]   which is profound misery for a few days
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.920]   and what I didn't appreciate at the time,
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.100]   which I obviously now look back at and realize
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.920]   is muscle mass loss.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:13.400]   It's very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.280]   after all of that loss,
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:17.200]   but my thought was exactly as you said,
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.660]   like there's got to be a resetting of the system here.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.000]   This must be sufficiently long enough
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.120]   to trigger all of those systems,
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   but you're getting at a bigger problem with neuroscience,
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.720]   which I'm really hoping the epigenetic field
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.040]   comes to the rescue on.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.140]   It has not come close to it to date,
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.660]   which is we don't have biomarkers
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.700]   around true metrics of aging.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.120]   Everything we have to date stinks.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:49.120]   So we're really good at using molecules or interventions
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.780]   for which we have biomarkers, right?
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.460]   Like when you lift weights,
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:57.120]   you can look at how much weight you're lifting,
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.460]   you can look at your DEXA scan
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:00.140]   and see how much muscle mass you're generating,
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.760]   like those are biomarkers.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.620]   Those are giving you outputs that say my input is good
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:08.060]   or my input needs to be modified.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.500]   When you take a sleep supplement,
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.900]   you can look at your eight sleep and go,
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.620]   oh, my sleep is getting better.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.120]   Like there's a biomarker.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.100]   When you take metformin, when you take rapamycin,
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.220]   when you fast, we don't have a biomarker
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.280]   that gives us any insight into whether or not
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.500]   we're moving in the right direction.
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.300]   And if we are, are we taking enough?
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.580]   Just don't know.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.460]   So I often get asked,
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.140]   like what's the single most important topic
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:39.300]   you would want to see more research dollars put to
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.060]   in terms of this space?
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.760]   And it's unquestionably this, as unsexy as it is,
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.900]   like who cares about biomarkers?
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.340]   But like without them,
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.100]   I don't think we're going to get great answers
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.080]   'cause you can't do most of the experiments
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.320]   you and I would dream up.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.960]   - Got it.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.900]   Well, I'm grateful that you're sitting across the table
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:03.820]   for me telling me all this and that everyone can hear this.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:07.940]   But again, we will put a link to the papers, plural,
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.120]   that Peter just described.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.800]   And for those of you that are listening and not watching,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.940]   hopefully you were able to track
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.380]   the general themes and takeaways.
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.180]   And it is fun to go to these papers.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.100]   You see these big stacks of numbers
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.740]   and it can be a little bit overwhelming.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:26.000]   But my additional suggestion on parsing papers
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.860]   is you notice that Peter said that he spent,
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:31.380]   you know, he's read it several times.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.620]   Unlike a newspaper article or a Instagram post,
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:38.980]   with a paper you're not necessarily going to get it
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.820]   the first time.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.820]   You certainly won't get everything.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.480]   So I think spending some time with papers for me
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.140]   means reading it and then reading it again
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.240]   a little bit later.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.780]   Or, you know, one figure at a time.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.620]   - Yeah, I was just about to say,
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:50.980]   'cause I kind of have a way that I do it,
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.380]   but I'm curious as to how you do it.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.240]   Like if you're encountering a paper for the first time,
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.180]   do you have an order in which you like to go through?
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.380]   Do you read it sequentially
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.120]   or do you look at the figures first?
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.180]   I mean, how do you go through it?
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.780]   - Yeah, unless it's an area that I know very, very well
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.980]   where I can, you know, skip to some things
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:09.980]   before reading it the whole way through.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.060]   My process is always the same.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:15.280]   And actually this is fun because I used to teach a class
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.620]   when I was a professor at UC San Diego
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.400]   called Neural Circuits in Health and Disease.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.480]   And it was an evening course that grew very quickly
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.440]   from 50 students to 400 plus students.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.060]   And we would do exactly this.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.500]   We would parse papers.
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:32.500]   And I had everyone ask what I called the four questions.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.560]   And it wasn't exactly four questions,
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.740]   but I have a little three by five card next to me
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:40.900]   or a piece of a main half by 11 paper typically.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.240]   And when I sit down with the paper,
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.540]   I want to figure out what is the question they're asking?
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.000]   What's the general question?
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.240]   What's the specific question?
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.960]   And I write down the question.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.940]   Then what was the approach?
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.260]   You know, how did they test that question?
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.860]   And sometimes that can get a bit detailed.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.540]   You can get into immunohistochemistry
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.820]   and they did a PCR for this.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.100]   It's not so important for most people
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.960]   that they understand every method,
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.800]   but it is worthwhile that if you encounter a method
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.800]   like PCR or, you know, chromatography or fMRI
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.800]   that you at least look up on the internet
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.340]   what its purpose is, okay?
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.660]   That will help a lot.
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.140]   And then it was what they found.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.820]   And there you can usually figure out
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.180]   what they believe they found anyway
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:24.940]   by reading the figure headers, right?
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.420]   What are, you know, figure one, here's the header.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.460]   Typically, if it's an experimental paper,
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.340]   it will tell you what they want you to think they found.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.880]   And then I tend to want to know the conclusion of the study.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.500]   And then this is really the key one.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.740]   And this is the one that would really distinguish
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.940]   the high-performing students from the others.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.980]   You have to go back at the end
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.820]   and ask whether or not the conclusions,
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:48.900]   the major conclusions drawn in the paper
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.280]   are really substantiated by what they found
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.120]   and what they did.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.440]   And that involves some thinking.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.500]   It involves really, you know,
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.140]   spending some time thinking about what they identified.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.600]   Now, this isn't something that anyone can do
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.440]   straight off the bat.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.820]   It's a skill that you develop over time
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.040]   and different papers require different formats.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.700]   But those four questions really form the cornerstone
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.820]   of teaching undergraduates
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.000]   and I think graduate students as well
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.200]   of how to read a paper.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.580]   And again, it's something that can be cultivated.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.440]   And it's still how I approach papers.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.380]   So what I do typically is I'll read title, abstract.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.620]   I usually then will skip to the figures
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.480]   and see how much of it I can digest
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.980]   without reading the text
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.020]   and then go back and read the text.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.060]   But in fairness, journals, great journals,
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.340]   like science, like nature,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.900]   oftentimes will pack so much information,
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.620]   the cell press journals too, into each figure.
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:42.180]   And it's coded with no definition of the acronyms
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.380]   that almost always I'm into the introduction and results
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.260]   within a couple of minutes,
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.920]   wondering what the hell this acronym is
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.940]   or that acronym is.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:51.860]   And it's just, yeah, it's just wild
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:55.860]   how much nomenclature there really is.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:56.900]   I can't remember, was it you
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.140]   or was it our friend Paul Conte when he was here
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.640]   who said that, oh no, I'm sorry, it was neither.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.220]   It was chair of ophthalmology at Stanford,
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.800]   Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, who was a guest on a podcast recently,
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.980]   who off camera, I think it was,
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:14.140]   told us that if you look at the total number of words
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.180]   and terms that a physician leaving medical school
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:20.660]   owns in their mind and their vocabulary,
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.020]   it's the equivalent of like two additional full languages
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.740]   of fluency beyond their native language.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.820]   So you're trilingual at least,
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:30.820]   and I don't know, do you speak a language other than English?
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.020]   - Poorly. - Okay, so you're
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.700]   at least trilingual and probably more.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.480]   So no one is expected to be able to parse these papers
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.580]   the first time through without substantial training.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.780]   - Yeah, no, I think that's a great format.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.900]   And you're absolutely right.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.960]   I have a different way that I do it
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.620]   when I'm familiar with the subject matter
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.220]   versus when I'm not. - Yeah, how do you do it?
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.080]   - Well, again, if I'm reading papers
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.420]   that are something that I know really well,
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.500]   I can basically glean everything
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.120]   I need to know from the figures.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.300]   And then sometimes I'll just do a quick skim on methods.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:05.460]   But I don't need to read the discussion,
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:06.460]   I don't need to read the intro,
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:07.940]   I don't need to read anything else.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:10.660]   If it's something that I know less about,
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:13.580]   then I usually do exactly what you say.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:16.260]   I try to start with the figures.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.700]   I usually end up generating more questions,
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.180]   like what do you mean, what is this, how did they do that?
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.020]   And then I gotta go back and read methods typically.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:28.220]   And one of the other things that's probably worth mentioning
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.020]   is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.740]   that are not attached to the paper.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:36.100]   So you're amazed at how much stuff gets put
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.140]   in the supplemental section.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.620]   And the reason for that, of course,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.260]   is that the journals are very specific
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.520]   on the format and length of a paper.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.780]   So a lot of the times when you're submitting something,
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:49.380]   like if you wanna put any additional information in there,
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.540]   it can't go in the main article,
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.820]   it has to go in the supplemental figure.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.200]   So even for this paper,
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.500]   there were a couple of the numbers I spouted off
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.400]   I had to pull out of the supplemental paper.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.020]   For example, when they did the sensitivity analysis
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.260]   on the censoring versus non-censoring,
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.140]   that was in the supplemental figure.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:10.100]   That was actually not even in the paper we presented.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.420]   - Well, should we pivot to this other paper?
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.240]   - Yeah.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.420]   - It's a very different sort of paper.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.220]   It's an experimental paper where there's a manipulation.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:22.060]   I must say, I love, love, love this paper.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.200]   And I don't often say that about papers.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.040]   I'm so excited about this paper for so many reasons,
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.460]   but I wanna give a couple of caveats up front.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:33.960]   First of all, the paper is not published yet.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.680]   The only reason I was able to get this paper
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.800]   is because it's on bioRxiv.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.320]   There's a new trend over the last,
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.940]   I would say five, six years of people posting the papers
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.340]   that they've submitted to journals for peer review online
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:49.040]   so that people can look at them prior to those papers
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.220]   being peer reviewed.
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.940]   So there is a strong possibility
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:53.540]   that the final version of this paper,
[01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:55.420]   which again, we will provide a link to,
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.560]   is going to look different,
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.280]   maybe even quite a bit different
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.440]   than the one that we're going to discuss.
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.140]   Nonetheless, there are a couple of things
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.900]   that make me confident in the data
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.820]   that we're about to talk about.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.160]   First of all, the group that published this paper
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.780]   is really playing in their wheelhouse.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:11.880]   This is what they do.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.080]   And they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.940]   I'm going to mispronounce her first name,
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.420]   but I think it's Chiaosi Gu,
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.500]   who's at the Econ School of Medicine in Mount Sinai,
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:28.300]   runs a laboratory there studying addiction in humans.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:33.300]   And the first author of the paper is Ofer Pearl.
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.800]   This paper is wild.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.120]   And I'll just give you a couple of the takeaways first
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.560]   as a bit of a hook to hopefully entice people
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.260]   into listening further,
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.500]   'cause this is an important paper.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.900]   This paper basically addresses how our beliefs
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.580]   about the drugs we take
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:54.580]   impacts how they affect us at a real level,
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:58.060]   not just at a subjective level, but at a biological level.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.900]   So just to back up a little bit,
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.540]   a former guest on this podcast, Dr. Ali Crum,
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.500]   whose name is actually Alia Crum,
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:08.540]   but she goes by Ali Crum, talked about belief effects.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:11.920]   Belief effects are different than placebo effects.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.940]   Placebo effects are really just category effects.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:18.500]   It's, okay, I'm going to give you this pill, Peter,
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.600]   and I'm going to tell you that this pill
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.320]   is molecule X5952,
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.100]   and that it's going to make your memory better.
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.260]   And then I give you a memory test, right?
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.400]   And your group performs better
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.820]   than the people in the control group
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.780]   who I give a pill to and I say, this is just a placebo.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.780]   Or there are other variants on this
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.980]   where people will get a drug and you tell them it's placebo.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.040]   They'll get a placebo, you tell them it's drug.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.300]   It's a binary thing.
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.460]   It's an on or an off thing.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.500]   You're either in the drug group or the placebo group,
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.740]   and you're either told that you're getting drug or placebo.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.340]   And we know that placebo effects exist.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:53.960]   In fact, one of the crueler ones,
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.060]   I was never the subject of this,
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.620]   but there was kind of lore in high school
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:58.260]   that kids would do this mean thing.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.620]   It's a form of bullying.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.440]   I really don't like it,
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.900]   where they'd get some kid at a party
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:06.020]   to drink alcohol-free beer,
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.620]   and then that kid would start acting drunk,
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.820]   and then they'd go, gotcha,
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.620]   it doesn't even have alcohol in it.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.620]   Now, that's a mean joke,
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:16.640]   and just reminds me of some of the horrors of high school.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.860]   Maybe that's why I didn't go very often,
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.220]   which I also don't suggest.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.000]   But no, it's a mean joke,
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.820]   but it speaks to the placebo effect, right?
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:25.440]   And there's also a social context effect.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.160]   So placebo effects are real.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.100]   We know this.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:30.460]   Belief effects are different.
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:34.660]   Belief effects are not A or B, placebo or non-placebo.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.120]   Belief effects have a lot of knowledge
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.140]   to enrich one's belief about a certain something
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:44.500]   that can shift their psychology and physiology
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:45.360]   one way or the other.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.860]   And I think the best examples of these, really,
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:50.340]   of these belief effects really do come from Allie Crump's lab
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.060]   in the psychology department at Stanford,
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.040]   although some of this work she did
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.080]   prior to getting into Stanford.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.340]   For instance, if people are put into a group
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:59.780]   where they watch a brief video,
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.980]   just a few minutes of video
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.580]   about how stress really limits our performance,
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.140]   let's say at archery or at mathematics or at music
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.640]   or at public speaking,
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.700]   and then you test them in any of those domains
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.820]   or other domains in a stressful circumstance,
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:16.100]   they perform less well, okay?
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.460]   And we know they perform less well
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:22.260]   because we're by virtue of a heightened stress response.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:23.100]   You can measure heart rate.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.820]   You can measure stroke volume of the heart.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.620]   You can measure peripheral blood flow,
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.900]   which goes down when people are stressed,
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.100]   narrowing a vision, et cetera.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.000]   You take a different group of people
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.260]   and randomly assign them to another group
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.600]   where now they're being told
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.260]   that stress enhances performance.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.420]   It mobilizes resources.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.080]   It narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:43.940]   et cetera, et cetera,
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.380]   and their performance increases above a control group
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:48.620]   that receives just useless information
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.560]   or at least useless as it relates to the task.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.520]   So in both cases, by the way,
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.560]   the groups are being told the truth.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.500]   Stress can be depleting or it can enhance performance,
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.920]   but this is different than placebo
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.780]   because now it's scaling according to the amount
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.760]   and the type of information that they're getting.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.140]   - And can you give me a sense of magnitude
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:09.500]   of benefit or detriment that one could experience
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.180]   in a situation like the one you just described?
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.940]   - Yeah, so it's striking.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.220]   They're opposite in direction.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:18.020]   So the stress gets us worse, makes you, let's say,
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.540]   I think that if we were to just put a rough percentage
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.380]   on this, it would be somewhere between 10 and 30% worse
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.980]   at performance than the control group.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.220]   And stress is enhancing
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:29.040]   is approximately equivalent improvement.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.580]   So they're in opposite directions.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:35.340]   Even more striking is the studies that Ali's lab did
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:37.460]   and others looking at, for instance,
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:38.720]   you give people a milkshake,
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.420]   you tell them it's a high calorie milkshake,
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.420]   has a lot of nutrients,
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.620]   and then you measure ghrelin secretion in the blood.
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:47.820]   And ghrelin is a marker of hunger that increases
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.060]   the longer it's been since you've eaten.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.220]   And what you notice is that suppresses ghrelin
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.460]   to a great degree and for a long period of time.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.340]   You give another group a shake,
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.580]   you tell them it's a low calorie shake,
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:58.840]   that it's got some nutrients in it,
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.220]   but that doesn't have much fat, not much sugar, et cetera.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.660]   They drink the shake, less ghrelin suppression.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:05.500]   - And it's the same shake.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.380]   - And it's the same shake.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:10.580]   And satiety lines up with that also in that study.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.420]   And then the third one, which is also pretty striking,
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:13.840]   is they took hotel workers,
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.080]   they gave them a short tutorial or not,
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.920]   informing them that moving around during the day
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.740]   and vacuuming and doing all that kind of thing is great.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:21.140]   It helps you lower your BMI,
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:22.340]   which is great for your health.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.580]   You incentivize them.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.360]   And then you let them out into the wild
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.180]   of their everyday job.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.580]   You measure their activity levels.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:29.760]   The two groups don't differ.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.980]   They're doing roughly the same task,
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.500]   leaning down, cleaning out trash cans, et cetera.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.340]   Guess what?
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:35.180]   The group that was informed
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:37.260]   about the health benefits of exercise,
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:41.980]   lose 12% more weight compared to the other group.
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:44.460]   - And no difference in actual movement?
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.780]   - Apparently not.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.200]   Now, how could that be?
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.980]   I mean, literally this was sparked by, in Allie's words,
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:55.580]   this was sparked by her graduate advisor saying,
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:58.220]   "What if all the effects of exercise are placebo?"
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.620]   Right, which is not what anyone really believes,
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.540]   but it's just such a...
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:05.100]   I love that anecdote that Allie told us
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.540]   because it just really speaks to how really smart
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.500]   people think.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.340]   They sit back and they go,
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:11.000]   "Yeah, exercise obviously has benefits,
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.220]   but what if a lot of the benefits
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.460]   are that you tell yourself it's good for you
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:15.060]   and the brain can actually activate
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:17.280]   these mechanisms in the body?
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.420]   And why wouldn't that be the case?
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:20.660]   'Cause the nervous system extends through both."
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:22.680]   - So interesting. - So interesting.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.880]   Okay, so fast forward to this study,
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.660]   which is really about belief effects, not placebo effects.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:32.700]   And to make a long story short,
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:37.420]   we know that nicotine, vaped, smoked, dipped, or snuffed,
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:40.220]   or these little zen pouches, or taken in capsule form,
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.020]   does improve cognitive performance.
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.380]   I'm not suggesting people run out
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.460]   and start doing any of those things.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.800]   I did a whole episode on nicotine.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.620]   The delivery device often will kill you
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:48.980]   some other way or is bad for you.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.940]   But it causes vasoconstriction,
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.420]   which is also not good for certain people.
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:55.220]   But nicotine is cognitive enhancing, why?
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.380]   Well, you have a couple of sites in the brain,
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:01.140]   namely in the basal forebrain, nucleus basalis,
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:05.340]   in the back of the brain structures like locus coeruleus,
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:07.060]   but also this, what's called, it's got a funny name,
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.980]   the pedunculopontine nucleus,
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:12.100]   which is this nucleus in the pons,
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.880]   in the back of the brain, in the brainstem,
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:16.340]   that sends those little axon wires into the thalamus.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:18.800]   The thalamus is a gateway for sensory information.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.260]   And in the thalamus, the visual information,
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:25.180]   the auditory information, it has nicotinic receptors.
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:28.100]   And when the pedunculopontine nucleus releases nicotine,
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:29.580]   or when you ingest nicotine,
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:32.600]   what it does is it increases the signal to noise
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.060]   of information coming in through your senses.
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:38.060]   So the fidelity of the signal that gets up to your cortex,
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.420]   which is your conscious perception of those senses,
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:41.260]   is increased.
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:44.000]   - And how much endogenous nicotine do we produce?
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.720]   - Ooh, well, it's going to be acetylcholine
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.260]   binding to nicotinic receptors.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.460]   - I see, we're not making nicotine.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:50.420]   - We're not making nicotine. - We're just binding.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.700]   So this is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.700]   - Right, of which there are at least seven
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.620]   and probably like 14 subtypes.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:01.700]   But so, right, they're called nicotinic receptors
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.200]   in an annoying way, in the same way
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.060]   that cannabinoid receptors are called cannabinoid receptors,
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:06.880]   but then everyone thinks,
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.020]   "Oh, you know, those receptors are there
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:10.300]   "because we're supposed to smoke pot,"
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.200]   or, "Those receptors are there
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.500]   "'cause we're supposed to ingest nicotine."
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.200]   No, the drugs that we use to study them--
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.340]   - The drug is named after the receptor, yeah.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:16.960]   - That's right, exactly.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.500]   Receptor is named after the drug.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.660]   And so the important thing to know is that
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:21.780]   whether or not it's basal forebrain
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.700]   or pedunculopontine nucleus or locus coeruleus,
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.500]   that at least in the brain,
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.480]   'cause we're not talking about muscle
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.060]   where acetylcholine does something else
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:31.060]   via nicotinic receptors,
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.120]   in general, it just tends to be a signal-to-noise enhancer.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:37.460]   And so for the non-engineering types out there, no problem.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.820]   Signal-to-noise, just imagine,
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.660]   I'm talking right now
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.560]   and there's a lot of static in the background.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.060]   There are two ways for you to be able
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:43.940]   to hear me more clearly.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:46.980]   We can reduce the static or I can increase the fidelity,
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.260]   the volume and the clarity of what I'm saying, okay?
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.720]   For instance, and that's really what acetylcholine does.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.200]   That's why when people smoke a cigarette,
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.940]   they get that boost of nicotine and they just feel clear.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.840]   It really works.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.940]   The other thing that happens is the thalamus
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.420]   sends information to a couple of places.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:07.740]   First of all, it sends information
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.300]   to the reward centers of the brain,
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:11.740]   the mesolimbic reward pathway that releases dopamine.
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:14.380]   And typically when nicotine is increased in our system,
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.060]   dopamine goes up.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.380]   That's one of the reasons why nicotine is reinforcing.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.840]   We just like it.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.680]   We seek it out.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:22.780]   I've done beautiful experiments with honeybees even,
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.100]   where you put nicotine on certain plants
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.080]   or it comes from certain plants and they'll forage there.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.920]   More, you get them kind of like buzzed.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.240]   That was a pun, bad pun.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.300]   In any event, there's also an output from this thing,
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:37.700]   the thalamus, to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.240]   which is an area of the forebrain that really allows us
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.340]   to limit our focus and our attention for sake of learning.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.920]   It allows us to pay attention.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.760]   This is the circuit.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.540]   - You talked about this in your fantastic podcast
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.840]   on stimulants.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.120]   - Yeah, on ADHD, typically ADHD drugs,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.280]   so things like Adderall, Vyvanse,
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.760]   methamphetamine for that matter, Ritalin.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.600]   - Yeah, why it's counterintuitive that a stimulant
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.200]   would be a treatment for someone with difficulty focusing.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.920]   - Yeah, in young kids who have difficulty focusing,
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.580]   if you give them something they love, they're like a laser.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:16.840]   And the reason is that ventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.400]   can engage is when the kid is interested and engaged,
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.780]   but kids with ADD, ADHD tend to have a hard time
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:25.980]   engaging their mind for other types of tasks
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.500]   and other types of tasks are important
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.420]   for getting through life.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:30.580]   And it turns out that giving those stimulant drugs
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:34.420]   in many cases can enhance the function of that circuit
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:37.400]   and it can strengthen so that ideally the kids
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.820]   don't need the drugs in the long run,
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.860]   although that's not often the way that it plays out.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.560]   And there are other ways to get at this.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.460]   There's now a big battle out there.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:46.680]   Is ADHD real?
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.520]   Is it not real?
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.340]   Of course it's real.
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:49.840]   Does every kid need ADHD meds?
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.680]   No.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.320]   Are there other things like nutrition,
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.960]   more playtime outside, et cetera,
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.160]   that can help improve their symptoms without drugs?
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.000]   Yes.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.540]   Is the combination of all those things together
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.120]   known to be most beneficial?
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.960]   Yes.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.120]   Are the dosages given too high
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.560]   and generally should be titrated down?
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.400]   Maybe.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.160]   Some kids need a lot, some kids need a little.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.160]   I probably just gained and lost a few enemies there.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.160]   So the point is that these circuits are hardwired circuits.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.740]   - Sorry, one other question, Andrew.
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:23.020]   If my memory serves correctly,
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:26.860]   doesn't nicotine potentially have a calming effect as well?
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:30.060]   And that seems a bit counterintuitive to the focusing one.
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.360]   Is it a dose effect or a timing effect?
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.200]   How does that work?
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.320]   - Yeah, it's a dosing effect.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.120]   So the interesting thing about nicotine
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.560]   is that it can enhance focus in the brain,
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.800]   but in the periphery,
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:42.340]   it actually provides some muscle relaxation.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:45.040]   So it's kind of the perfect drug if you think about it.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.120]   Again, I was reflecting on this,
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.560]   how when we were growing up,
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.580]   people would smoke on plane,
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.580]   they had a smoking section on the plane.
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.000]   You know, people smoked all the time
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.420]   and now hardly anyone smokes for all the obvious reasons.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:59.860]   But yeah, it provides that really ideal balance
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:02.760]   between being alert, but being mellow
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.940]   and relaxed in the body.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.840]   So, hence it's reinforcing properties.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.420]   Okay, this study is remarkable
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.060]   because what they did is they had people
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:16.480]   come into the laboratory, they gave them a vape pen.
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.420]   These are smokers.
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:21.620]   So these are experienced smokers.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.540]   Typically there's a washout before they come in
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:24.820]   so they're not smoking for a bit
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.380]   so they can clear their system of nicotine
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.220]   and they measure-
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:28.300]   - How long is that needed?
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:29.580]   - Typically it's a couple of days.
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.420]   - Oh, okay.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:32.260]   - Yeah, which must be miserable for those people.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.100]   - I was just about to say,
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.220]   'cause they can't have nicorette gum or anything.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.420]   - No, nothing, they must be dying.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:36.840]   And I wonder how many cheat.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:39.300]   - But they can measure carbon monoxide, right?
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.140]   - They measure carbon monoxide
[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:42.140]   and they're measuring nicotine in the blood as well.
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:43.700]   So they do a good job there.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.420]   So then what they do is they have them vape
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:49.600]   and they're vaping either a low, medium,
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.140]   or high dose of nicotine.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:52.920]   The dosages don't really matter
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.100]   because tolerance varies, et cetera.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.420]   And then they are putting them
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:00.420]   into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine.
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:03.380]   So where they can look at, it's really blood flow,
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:05.100]   it's really hemodynamic response.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.540]   For those of you who want to know,
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.380]   it's the ratio of the oxygenated to deoxygenated blood
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:13.180]   because when blood will flow to neurons that are active
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.620]   to give it oxygen and then it's deoxygenated
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:18.100]   and then there's a change in what's called the bold signal.
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:21.740]   So FMRI, when you see these like hotspots in the brain
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.220]   is really just looking at blood flow.
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.140]   And then there's some interesting physics around
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:27.100]   and I'll probably get this wrong,
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:28.120]   but I'll take an attempt at it
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.140]   so that I get beat up a little bit
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.800]   by the physicists and engineers.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:32.020]   Do you remember the right hand rule?
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:32.840]   - Yep. - Right, okay.
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.900]   So do I have this right, correct?
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.380]   The right hand rule, if you put your thumb out
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:38.400]   with your index finger, your middle finger,
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.660]   your thumb facing up,
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:41.340]   I think that the thumb represents the charge,
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:42.860]   the direction of the charge, right?
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.660]   And then isn't the electromagnetic field is the downward
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.480]   facing figure and then it's, do I have that right?
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:51.020]   I have to look this up. - I actually don't.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.580]   - Okay, well, someone will look it up.
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:54.300]   But what you do is when you put a person's head
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.960]   in this big magnet and then you pulse the magnet,
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:00.980]   what happens is the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood,
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:03.500]   it interacts with the magnetic field differently
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.680]   and that difference in signal can be detected.
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.900]   And you can see that in the form of activated brain areas.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.980]   - Yeah, I mean, MRI all works by proton detection.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:15.260]   So presumably there's a difference in the proton signal
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.760]   when you have high oxygen versus low oxygen concentration.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.180]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.020]   And what they'll do is they'll pulse with the magnet
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.620]   because my understanding is that,
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:26.800]   and this is definitely getting beyond my expertise,
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:29.460]   but that the spin orientation of the protons,
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:32.660]   then it's going to relax back at a different rate as well.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.820]   So by the relaxation at a different rate,
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.660]   you can also get not just resting state activation,
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:39.620]   like, oh, look at a banana,
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.120]   what areas of the brain light up?
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:44.420]   But you can look at connectivity between areas
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:47.260]   and how one area is driving the activity of another area.
[01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:48.840]   So very powerful technique.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:52.060]   So what they do is they put people in a scanner
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.220]   and then you'll like this 'cause you'll--
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:57.100]   - What are the limitations of FMRI in terms of,
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.240]   I mean, how fine is the resolution?
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.620]   I mean, where are the blind spots of the technique?
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:05.020]   - So resolution, you can get down to sub centimeter.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:07.260]   They talk about it always in these paper as a voxels,
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:10.340]   which are these little cubic pixels things.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.160]   You know, sub centimeter,
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.960]   but you're not going to get down to millimeter.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.400]   There are a number of little confounds
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.100]   that maybe we won't go into now
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.000]   that have been basically worked out over the last 10 years
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.200]   by doing the following.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.880]   You can't just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:28.880]   I'll just tell you the experiment.
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.160]   It was discovered, for instance,
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.260]   that when someone would move their right hand,
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:33.880]   'cause when you're in the MRI,
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:36.140]   I just went for one of these recently for clinical,
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:38.080]   not a problem, but just for a diagnostics hand,
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.420]   you're leaning back and you can move your right hand a bit.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.960]   And they would see an area in motor cortex lighting up.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:45.640]   But what they noticed was that the area
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.420]   corresponding to the left hand was also lighting up.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:50.220]   So what you really have to do
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.260]   is you have to look at resting state.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:53.780]   How much are they lighting up?
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:56.300]   Just at rest and then subtract that out.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.460]   So now you'll always see resting state
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.240]   versus activation state.
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:03.340]   - Yeah, wasn't there a really funny study
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:05.380]   done as a spoof maybe a decade ago
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:08.680]   that put a dead salmon into an MRI machine
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.140]   and did an, like they did an FMRI of a dead salmon
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:14.840]   that demonstrated like some interesting signal.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:17.000]   - No, I didn't know that one.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.680]   - We got to find this one for the show notes.
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.120]   - We should do one of these wild papers ones.
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.960]   There are papers of people putting, don't do this folks,
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.660]   putting elephants on LSD that were published in science
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:29.320]   and things like that, like crazy experiments.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:32.120]   We should definitely do a crazy experiments journal club.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.100]   In any event, you can get a sense
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.980]   of which brain areas are active and when
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:40.260]   with fairly high spatial resolution, fairly high,
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:42.180]   and pretty good temporal resolution
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:44.800]   on the order of hundreds of milliseconds.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:47.500]   But it's not ultra fast
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.540]   because a lot of neural transmission is happening
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:51.500]   on the tens of milliseconds,
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:54.940]   especially when you're in talking about auditory processing.
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:57.460]   Okay, so they put people into the scanner
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:00.140]   and then they give them essentially a task
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:02.720]   that's designed to engage the thalamus,
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.040]   known to engage the thalamus reward centers
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:08.240]   and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.620]   And it's a very simple game.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:12.240]   You'll like this 'cause you have a background in finance.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.160]   You let people watch a market.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:16.520]   You know, okay, here's the stock market,
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.720]   or you could say, or the price of peas,
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:19.560]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.480]   It goes up, it goes down,
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.640]   and they're looking at a squiggle line, then it stops.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.780]   And then they have the option,
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:25.000]   but they have to pick one option.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.720]   They're either going to invest a certain number
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:29.640]   of the hundred units that you've given them,
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.240]   or they can short it.
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:32.480]   They can say, oh, it's going to go down
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:34.200]   and try and make money on the prediction
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.280]   it's going to go down.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:38.760]   You could explain shorting better than I could, for sure.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.660]   So depending on whether or not
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.760]   they get the prediction right or wrong,
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.360]   they get more points or they lose points,
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.040]   and they're going to be rewarded in real money
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.920]   at the end of the experiment.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.820]   So this is going to engage this type of circuitry.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:53.080]   Now, remember, these groups were given a vape pen
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.520]   prior to this, where they've vaped,
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.360]   what they were told is either a low, medium,
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.720]   or high dose of nicotine.
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.520]   And they do this task.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:05.400]   The goal is not to get them to perform better on the task.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.560]   The goal is to engage the specific brain areas
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:09.640]   that are relevant to this kind of error
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.960]   and reward type circuits.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.500]   And we know that this task does that.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.040]   So that includes the thalamus,
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.840]   that includes the mesolimbic reward pathway and dopamine.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.920]   It includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:24.080]   First of all, they measure nicotine in the blood.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.160]   They are measuring how much people vaped.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.340]   They were very careful about this.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.840]   One of the nice things about the vape pen
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:31.900]   for the sake of experiment and not recommending people vape,
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:33.340]   but they can measure how much nicotine
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:34.620]   is left in the vape pen before,
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:36.660]   after they can measure how long they inhaled,
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.920]   how long they held it in.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:38.760]   There's a lot that you can do
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.520]   that's harder to do with a cigarette.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.060]   Okay.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:45.680]   They measured people's belief as to whether or not
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.600]   they got low, medium, or high amounts of nicotine.
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.760]   And it's- - They were told.
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.960]   - They were told this is a low amount,
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:54.040]   a medium amount, or a high amount.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.680]   And then of course they looked at brain area activation
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.680]   during this task.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.560]   And what they found was very straightforward.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.220]   - Sorry, they were all given the same amount.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.840]   - Yes, this is the sneak.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.680]   I was going to offer it as a punchline, but that's okay.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.300]   No, I think that the cool thing about this experiment
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.240]   is that the subjects are unaware
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.840]   that they all got the exact same amount
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:16.760]   of relatively low nicotine containing vape pen.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.020]   So they basically,
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:19.400]   and they're measuring it from their bloodstream.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.080]   So they all have fairly low levels of nicotine,
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.280]   but one group was told you got a lot.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:25.920]   One group was told you got a medium amount,
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.360]   and the other was told you got a little bit.
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.600]   Now, a number of things happen,
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.120]   but the most interesting things are the following.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.280]   First of all, people's subjective feeling
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:40.320]   of being on the drug matches what they were told.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.140]   So if they were told,
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.880]   "Hey, this is a high amount of nicotine."
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.720]   Like, "Yeah, it feels like a high amount of nicotine."
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.720]   And these are experienced smokers.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.760]   If it was a medium amount,
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.600]   they're like, "Yeah, that feels like a medium amount."
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:53.060]   If it was a low amount, they think it was a low amount.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:54.860]   Now that's perhaps not so surprising.
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:56.480]   That's you're just- - That's the placebo
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:58.120]   in that sense. - That's the placebo.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.720]   But if you look at the activation of the thalamus
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:04.680]   in the exact regions
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:07.620]   where you would predict acetylcholine transmission
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.440]   to impact the function of the thalamus.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.380]   So these include areas
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:12.060]   like what's called the centromedan nucleus,
[01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:13.200]   the ventroposterior nucleus,
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.560]   the names that really don't matter,
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.780]   but these are areas involved in attention.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:22.120]   It scales with what they thought they got in the vape pen.
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.020]   Meaning if you were told
[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.720]   that you got a low amount of nicotine,
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.840]   you got a little bit of activation in these areas.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.440]   If you were told that you got a medium amount of nicotine
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.920]   and that's what you vaped,
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.340]   then you had medium amounts
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:35.840]   or moderate amounts of activation.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.180]   And if you were told you got high amounts of nicotine,
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:40.060]   you got a high degree of activation.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:42.560]   And the performance on the task,
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.360]   believe it or not, scales with it somewhat.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.120]   So keep in mind,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:51.080]   everyone got the exact same amount of nicotine in reality.
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.520]   So here, the belief effect
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:56.160]   isn't just changing what one subjectively experiences.
[01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:59.480]   Oh, this is the effect of high nicotine or low nicotine.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:00.840]   It actually is changing the way
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:04.160]   that the brain responds to the belief.
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.160]   And that to me is absolutely wild.
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:08.360]   Now, there are a couple of other things
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.400]   that could have confounded this.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.200]   First of all, it could have been
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:14.200]   that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine,
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:17.360]   you're just faster or you're reading the lines better
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.960]   or your response time to hit the button is quicker.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:20.800]   I tell you, you have a drug
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.240]   that's going to improve reaction time.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.640]   You might believe that about nicotine.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:25.440]   And so you're quicker on the trigger
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.980]   and you're getting, they have a desi--
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:27.820]   - More activation as well.
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.320]   - More activation.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.180]   There could be, they rule that out.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.760]   They also rule out the possibility--
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:33.860]   - How did they rule that out?
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.200]   - By looking at rates of pressing.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.120]   - And there was no difference. - Nothing.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:38.880]   And in sensory areas of the brain
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.700]   that would represent that kind of difference,
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:43.080]   they don't see that.
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.280]   The other thing that is very clear
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.480]   is that the connection between the thalamus
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.480]   and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.160]   that pathway scales in the most beautiful way
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.760]   such that people that were told they had smoked a low
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.700]   or vaped a low amount of nicotine
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.240]   got a subtle activation of that pathway.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.200]   People that were told that they got a moderate amount
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.280]   of nicotine got a more robust activation of that pathway.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.240]   And the people that were told that they got a high amount
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.840]   of nicotine in the vape pen saw a very robust activation
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:15.520]   of the thalamus to this ventral prefrontal cortical pathway.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.680]   Now, of course, this is all happening
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.680]   under the hood of the skull simply on the basis
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.000]   of what they were told and what they believe.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.320]   - And technically, the fMRI is showing the activation
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.920]   of those two areas, and that's how you can infer
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.360]   the strength of that connection.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:32.180]   - That's right.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.120]   There's a separate method called diffuser tensor imaging,
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.280]   which was developed, I believe,
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.280]   out of the group in Minnesota.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:42.020]   Minnesota has a very robust group in terms of neuroimaging
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:44.720]   that can measure activation in fiber pathways.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.840]   This is not that, but you can look at the timing
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.200]   of activation, and it's a known
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.760]   what we call monosynaptic pathway.
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.260]   So we haven't talked so much about figures here,
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:55.980]   but I guess if we were gonna look at any one figure,
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:58.980]   and I can just describe it for the audience
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:01.440]   that doesn't have the figure in front of them.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:08.320]   Let's see, probably the most important figure is figure two.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.180]   Remember, I said I like to read the titles of figures,
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:14.400]   which is that the belief about nicotine strength
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.300]   induced a dose-dependent response in the thalamus.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:21.560]   Basically, if you and figure 2B can tell you
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.300]   if they believe that they got more nicotine,
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:27.780]   that's essentially the response that they saw.
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.080]   So if you look, or sorry, panel E,
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   if you look at the belief rating
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:37.080]   as a function of the estimate in the thalamus
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.660]   of how much activation there was,
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:41.820]   it's a mess when you look at all the dots at once,
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:44.260]   but if you just separate it out by high, medium, and low,
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:45.120]   you run the statistics,
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.340]   what you find is that there's a gradual increase,
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:52.100]   but a legitimate one from low to medium to high.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:54.020]   In other words, if I tell you
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.500]   this is a high dose of nicotine,
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.320]   your brain will react as if it's a high dose of nicotine.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.360]   Now, what they didn't do was give people zero nicotine.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.200]   - Yeah, I was about to say
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.240]   there's a control that's missing here, right?
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:07.040]   - Yeah, so what they didn't do is give people zero nicotine
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:10.360]   and then tell them this is a high amount of nicotine,
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.680]   sort of the equivalent of the cruel high school experiment.
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:15.760]   No alcohol, but then the kid acts drunk.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:19.940]   Now, in the high school example,
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:20.820]   it's unclear whether or not
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.740]   the kid actually felt drunk or not.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:27.120]   It's unclear whether or not they had been drunk previously,
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:28.820]   if they even knew what it would be like
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:31.540]   to feel drunk, et cetera, and there's the social context.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.820]   What I find just outrageous
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:36.340]   and outrageously interesting about this study
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:40.960]   is simply that what we are told about the dose of a drug
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.700]   changes the way that our physiology
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:44.480]   responds to the dose of the drug.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.100]   And in my understanding, this is the first study
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.460]   to ever look at dose dependence of belief effects, right?
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:54.540]   To really, and why would that be important?
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.420]   Well, for almost every study of drugs,
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:58.180]   you look at a dose dependent curve.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:01.400]   You look at zero, low dose, medium dose, high dose,
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.400]   and here they clearly are seeing a dose dependent response
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.440]   simply to the understanding
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.340]   of what they expect the drug ought to do.
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:18.380]   In other words, you can bypass pharmacology somewhat, right?
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:20.380]   - Now, look at figure 2B.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:21.720]   Am I reading this correctly?
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:25.040]   So it's got four bars on there.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.100]   You've got the group who were told they got a low dose,
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:30.480]   the group who was told they got a medium dose,
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:32.040]   the group that was told they had a high dose,
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.880]   and then these healthy controls,
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:37.060]   who presumably were non-smokers
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.660]   who were just put in the machine.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.200]   - That's right.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.460]   - Yeah, this is measuring parameter estimate.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:46.900]   Is that referring to their ability
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.200]   to play the trading game?
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.620]   - The parameter estimate is the activation,
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.720]   reward related activities
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.480]   from an independent thalamus mask, right?
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.620]   So what they're doing is they're just saying,
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:00.500]   if we just look at the thalamus,
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:01.980]   what is the level of activation?
[02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:03.380]   - I see, so this suggests
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:06.120]   that the only statistical difference
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.740]   was between the low and the high.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:10.900]   - That's right.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:12.660]   - And nobody else was statistically different.
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.500]   - That's right.
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.320]   - But that's not the whole story?
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.420]   - No, that's not the whole story.
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:18.900]   So when you look at the output from the thalamus
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:21.860]   to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:24.040]   that's where you start to identify the--
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.300]   - Is that figure four?
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.660]   - That is, yes.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:30.220]   So this is where you see, so figure four B,
[02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:31.720]   if you look at parameter estimate,
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:33.100]   so this is the degree of activation
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:34.580]   between the thalamus
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:36.760]   and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.940]   and it's called the instructed belief,
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:41.600]   you can see that there's a low, medium,
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.040]   and high scatter of dots for each,
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:46.180]   and that each one of those is significant.
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:50.360]   - So isn't it interesting that at the thalamus,
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:54.240]   which is, and you'll immediately appreciate my stupidity
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.940]   when it comes to neuroscience,
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:58.920]   which is more proximate to the nicotinamide,
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:01.860]   or the nicotinamide, what do you call it,
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.360]   the nicotine acetylcholine receptor,
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:08.040]   you have a lower difference of signal strength,
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:09.940]   and somehow that got amplified
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:12.060]   as it made its way forward in the brain?
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:12.900]   - Yeah.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:13.720]   - Does that surprise you?
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.660]   - It is surprising, and it surprised them as well,
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:19.040]   that the interpretation they give,
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:20.140]   again, as we were talking about before,
[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:22.140]   important to match their conclusions
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.340]   against what they actually found,
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.680]   which is what we're doing here,
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.820]   the interpretation that they give
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:30.720]   is that it doesn't take much nicotinic receptor occupancy
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.180]   in the thalamus to activate this pathway,
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.540]   but they too were surprised
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:36.640]   that they could not detect a raw difference
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.820]   in the activation of the thalamus,
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:41.420]   but in terms of its output to the prefrontal cortex,
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:42.260]   that's when the difference showed up.
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:46.260]   - Because that figure, 4B, is more convincing
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:49.180]   than figure two, because even figure 2E,
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:52.580]   if you read the fine print, the R,
[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:56.700]   the correlation coefficient is .27, it's not that strong.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:57.540]   - It's weak.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.260]   - So at the thalamus, it's kind of like,
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.540]   yeah, there might be a signal,
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:03.040]   by the way, this goes back to our earlier discussion,
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.060]   there could be a huge signal here and we're underpowered,
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.500]   how many subjects were in this?
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.540]   So you wouldn't have a lot of subjects in this experiment.
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.900]   - Yeah, no, and this just speaks to the general challenge
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.060]   of doing this kind of work.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:16.560]   It's hard to get a lot of people in and through the scanner.
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.400]   - Yeah, and it's expensive.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.900]   - And it's expensive.
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:19.940]   We have to, I should know this,
[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:22.060]   but we can go back to the methods.
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:23.540]   - But you can sort of just look
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:24.780]   at the number of dots on here.
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.560]   I mean, it's in the low tens, right?
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:29.220]   It's like 40, 30, something like that.
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.060]   So it's possible you do this--
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.340]   - It's not your Danish study.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:33.300]   - Yeah, yeah, you do this with 1,000 people,
[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.980]   this could all be statistically significant.
[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.540]   - Right, it was, so they talk about this,
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:40.500]   based on this, we estimated that an N of 20,
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:42.340]   N is sample size, in each belief condition,
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.460]   the final sample would provide 90% power
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:46.560]   to detect an effect of this magnitude
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:50.860]   at an alpha of 0.5 in a two-tailed test.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.580]   - Okay, so that's them referring
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:53.700]   to what we just talked about,
[02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:56.900]   which is we believe at 90% confidence
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:58.540]   to get an alpha of 0.05,
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:00.820]   which means we'll want to be 95% confidence,
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:02.900]   we need 60 people, 20 per group.
[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:03.860]   - Right, yeah.
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:05.520]   - But if the difference is smaller
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.280]   than what they expected,
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.120]   they'll miss out on some of the significance,
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:10.400]   which it looks like they're missing
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:11.860]   between the medium and high group.
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:13.700]   - Yep, and I too was surprised
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:16.260]   that they did not see a difference
[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:18.140]   between the medium and the high group,
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:19.940]   but they did in the output of the thalamus.
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:22.420]   I was also surprised that they didn't see a difference,
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:24.900]   this is kind of interesting in its own right,
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.460]   if figure three talks about their belief
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:28.620]   about nicotine strength did not modulate
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:31.080]   the reward response, the dopamine response.
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:31.920]   - How was that measured?
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.060]   Also, just in fMRI flow.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:36.400]   - Yeah, exactly, so if you look at figure 3B,
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:39.320]   other people can't see it, but basically,
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:41.120]   what you'll see is that there's no difference
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.160]   between these different groups
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.260]   in terms of the amount of activation
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:47.580]   in these reward pathways if people got a low, medium,
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:48.740]   or high amount of nicotine.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:53.160]   Now, that actually could be leveraged, I believe,
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.360]   if somebody were trying to quit nicotine, for instance,
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.360]   and they were going to do that
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.200]   by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.400]   that they were taking,
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.800]   but you told them that it was the same amount,
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.260]   from one day to the next,
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:08.000]   you could whittle it down to, presumably,
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.780]   to a low amount before taking it to zero,
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:13.060]   and if they believed it to be a greater amount,
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:16.780]   then it might actually not disrupt their reward pathways,
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.320]   meaning they would feel, presumably,
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.240]   they'd feel rewarded by whatever nicotine
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:22.300]   they were bringing in.
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:23.680]   - What would be your prediction
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.740]   if this experiment were repeated,
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:29.200]   but it was done exactly the same way with nonsmokers?
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:34.060]   - Ooh, well, one thing that's sort of interesting,
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:37.860]   you asked about potential sources of artifact,
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:38.980]   problems with fMRI.
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:41.060]   One of the challenges that they know in this study
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:43.700]   was you have to stay very still in the machine,
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:46.320]   but the subjects were constantly coughing
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.780]   because they're smokers.
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:51.380]   So, okay, so presumably the data would be higher fidelity.
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:52.420]   Started chuckling at that one,
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.840]   but I was like, I had to read that one twice.
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:55.680]   I was like, oh, that makes sense.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.580]   They're smokers, they're coughing, they can't stay still,
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:59.780]   so movement artifact.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:01.380]   But in all seriousness,
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:05.040]   I think that for people that are naive to nicotine,
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.860]   even a small amount of nicotine
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.860]   is likely to get this pathway
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:11.740]   activated to such a great degree.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.180]   Sort of like the first time effect of pretty much any drug.
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:18.380]   - But I wonder if they would be more or less susceptible
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:20.680]   to the belief system.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.020]   - Yeah, that's a really good question.
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.940]   Right, because they have no prior to compare it to.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:25.660]   - They have no pleasant,
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.160]   they have no experience to compare it to
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:31.720]   with respect to the obviously beneficial effects of nicotine
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.480]   that the smokers are well used to.
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:36.000]   - So this is the poor kid that got duped
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.060]   into thinking the non-alcoholic beer was at alcohol,
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.280]   though they're actually the winner, we know,
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.600]   because I did an episode on alcohol.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.480]   Alcohol's bad for you.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:43.640]   So in the end, that kid wins,
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.120]   and the other ones lose poetic justice.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.560]   But that kid, having never been actually drunk before,
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.280]   presumably would experience it more susceptible.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.000]   - I would feel like he'd be more susceptible potentially.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.540]   - That's my guess as well.
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:01.540]   So, you know, my glee for this experiment is not,
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:02.480]   or this paper rather,
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:04.220]   is not because I think it's the be all end all,
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:06.000]   or it's a perfect experiment.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.040]   I just think it's so very cool
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:11.520]   that they're starting to explore dose dependence of belief,
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.140]   because that has all sorts of implications.
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:17.100]   I mean, use your imagination, folks,
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:21.120]   whether or not we're talking about a drug,
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.880]   we're talking about a behavioral intervention,
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:25.200]   we're talking about a vaccine,
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.440]   and I'm not referring to any one specific vaccine.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.100]   I'm just talking to vaccines generally.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:32.960]   I'm talking about psychoactive drugs.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.500]   I'm talking about illicit drugs.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:37.440]   I'm talking about antidepressants.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:39.960]   I'm talking about all the sorts of drugs
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:42.180]   we were talking about before, metformin, et cetera.
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.520]   Just throw our arms around all of it.
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:50.360]   What we believe about the effects of a drug, presumably,
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:53.280]   in addition to what we believe about how much we're taking
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.240]   and what those effects ought to be,
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.940]   clearly are impacting at least the way
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:00.840]   that our brain reacts to those drugs.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.240]   - Yeah, it's very interesting.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.960]   I mean, when you consider how many drugs
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.960]   that have peripheral effects or peripheral outputs
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.560]   begin with central issues.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.720]   So again, I think the GLP-1 agonists
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.040]   are such a great example of this.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.200]   - Osempic. - Yeah.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.760]   You know, I don't think anybody fully understands
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.560]   exactly how they're working,
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.440]   but it's hard to argue that they're impacting,
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.640]   that the GLP-1 analog is having a central impact.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:32.040]   It's doing something in the brain
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:34.160]   that is leading to a reduction of appetite.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.200]   - We believe that. - Yeah.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:38.000]   - Yeah, and I think the mouse data point to different areas
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.240]   of the hypothalamus that are related to satiety,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.920]   that it's at least possible.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.040]   - Yeah, I mean, there's no quicker way
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.760]   to make a mouse overeat or under eat
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.720]   than by lesioning its hypothalamus,
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.380]   depending on where you do so.
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:55.320]   So presumably these drugs work there.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.280]   But again, it speaks to like, what do you need to believe
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.040]   in order for that to be the case?
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:02.040]   - Have they done placebo trials there
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:04.720]   where people get something and they're told-
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:05.560]   - Oh, they do.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.200]   I mean, of course, those drugs have all been tested
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.000]   via placebo and the placebo groups, you know,
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.120]   don't do anywhere near as well.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.000]   That's how we know that there's activity of the drug.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.720]   But again, there's, you know,
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:19.200]   that's a little bit different than being told
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:20.960]   you are absolutely getting it, right?
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.520]   'Cause in the RCTs, you're just told
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.760]   you might be getting it, you might not be getting it.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.720]   So it's not quite the same as this experiment.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.420]   This experiment is one level up where you're being told,
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:34.360]   no, you're absolutely getting it.
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.960]   You're just getting different doses of it.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:38.440]   - Yeah, to take this to maybe the ADHD realm,
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.800]   let's say a kid has been on ADHD meds for a while
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.400]   and the parents, for whatever reason,
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.040]   the physician decided they want to cut back on the dosage.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.560]   But if they were to tell the kid it's the same dosage
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.520]   they've always been taking
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.160]   and it's had a certain positive effect for them,
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:55.640]   according to the results, at least in this paper,
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:58.360]   which are not definitive, but are interesting,
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:00.760]   the lower dose may be as effective
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.360]   simply on the basis of belief.
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:05.780]   And this is the part that makes it so cool to me is that,
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:08.440]   and it's not a kid tricking themselves
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.160]   or the parents tricking the kid
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:13.760]   so much as the brain activation
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.900]   is corresponding to the belief, right?
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:17.400]   So that's where this- - No, that's very cool.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.120]   - This is why, because it's done in the brain,
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.180]   I think we can, you know,
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.720]   it gets to these kind of abstract, nearly mystical,
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.900]   but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects,
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:28.060]   which is that, you know,
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:30.420]   your brain is a prediction making machine.
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:32.740]   It's a data interpretation machine,
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:36.200]   but it's clear that one of the more important pieces of data
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:39.760]   are your beliefs about how these things impact you.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.400]   So it's not that this bypasses physiology.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.640]   People aren't deluding themselves.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:47.000]   The thalamus is behaving as if it's a high dose
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.880]   when it's the same dose as the low dose group.
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:50.760]   Wild.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:52.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I think of the implications, for example,
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:54.200]   with blood pressure, right?
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.840]   Like we don't really understand essential hypertension,
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:58.680]   which is the majority of people walking around
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:14:59.560]   with high blood pressure.
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:01.620]   It's unclear etiology.
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:04.600]   So lots of people being treated.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:06.900]   How do we know that the belief system about it
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:09.240]   can't be changed?
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:14.240]   And yeah, this is, I don't know, this is eye-opening.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.960]   - Yeah, it's cool stuff.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:19.220]   And allochrome is onto some other really cool stuff.
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:21.580]   Like for instance, just to highlight
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.880]   where these belief effects are starting to show up.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.860]   If you tell a group that the side effects of a drug
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:31.480]   that they're taking are evidence that the drug really works
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.680]   for the purpose that they're taking it,
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:35.560]   even though those side effects are kind of annoying,
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.120]   people report the experience as less awful
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.940]   and they report more relief from the primary symptoms
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.240]   that they're trying to target.
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.640]   So our belief about what side effects are,
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:46.480]   - That's so interesting.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.260]   - can really impact how quickly and how compatible
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:53.720]   we feel about, how quickly a drug works, excuse me,
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.740]   and how compatible we feel that drug is
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:56.640]   with our entire life.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.520]   So maybe if we call them something else,
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:15:59.480]   like not side effects,
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:01.780]   but like additional benefits or something,
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:02.620]   it's kind of crazy.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:05.000]   And you don't want to lie to people obviously,
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.800]   but you also don't want to send yourself
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:08.220]   in the opposite direction,
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:11.760]   which is reading the list of side effects of a drug
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.200]   and then developing all of those side effects
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:18.460]   when, and then maybe later coming to the understanding
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:21.400]   that some of those were raised through belief effects.
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:22.420]   - We definitely see that.
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:23.920]   That's the nocebo effect, right?
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.920]   That's the one we see a lot with all sorts of drugs.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.760]   And it's tough because how do you know which is which?
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.680]   And I think there are some people
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:36.080]   who are really impacted by that
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.520]   and it makes it very difficult for them
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:40.420]   to take any sort of pharmacologic agent
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:44.060]   because they basically, they can't help,
[02:16:44.060 --> 02:16:46.300]   but incur every possible side effect.
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:49.560]   - Is it true that medical students
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:51.120]   often will start developing the symptoms
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.260]   of the different diseases that they're learning about?
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.100]   Is that true?
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:55.060]   - Well, you know, I'll tell you,
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:56.400]   I do think that in medical school,
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.000]   you start to think of the zebras more than the horses
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.520]   all the time.
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.540]   You know, like, you know what I'm referring to, right?
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:07.820]   You know, you see footprints, you see hoof prints,
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:08.880]   you should think of horses,
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:09.940]   but of course medical students,
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:11.620]   you only think of the zebras.
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:13.280]   There are some really funny things in medical school.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.200]   Like there are certain conditions
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:16.840]   that you spend so much time thinking about
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.340]   that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence.
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:21.180]   You know, like in medical school,
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.840]   there's this condition called sarcoidosis.
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:26.280]   Like I feel like we never stop talking about sarcoidosis.
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:29.440]   I've seen like three cases in my life, right?
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:31.960]   Like it's just not that common.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:34.020]   - Does it provide a great teaching tool or something?
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:34.860]   - I don't know.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:38.280]   Like I just, some of these things I don't know.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:40.860]   How much time did we spend talking about situs inversus?
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:44.800]   This is when people embryologically have a reversed rotation
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.820]   and everything in their body is flipped.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.180]   Literally everything is flipped.
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:51.400]   So their heart is on the right side,
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:53.080]   their liver is on the left side,
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:54.300]   their appendix is on the left side.
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:56.740]   Like, and so I'm not making this up.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:58.200]   - How common is this?
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.540]   - I've never seen it, okay?
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.160]   - I was thinking about boxing and the liver shot.
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:03.580]   Like you could easily be going
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:04.620]   for the wrong side of the body.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.920]   - No, I swear to God, like as a medical student,
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.480]   if you were told someone had left-sided lower quadrant pain
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:12.400]   to which the answer is almost assuredly,
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:14.180]   like they have diverticulitis,
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.120]   you'd think they could have appendicitis
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.520]   in the context of situs inversus.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.880]   Like the fact that that would even register
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:24.000]   in the top 10 things that it could possibly be.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.880]   But yes, you just have a totally warped sense
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:26.800]   of what's out there.
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.080]   - Oh man.
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:32.080]   Well, this has been pure pleasure for me.
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:32.920]   I don't know about you.
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.180]   I don't know about our listeners,
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:38.680]   but for me, this is among the things that I just delight in
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:42.240]   and even more so because you're the one across the table
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:44.360]   for me teaching me about these incredible findings
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:46.880]   and the gaps in those findings,
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.360]   which are equally incredible
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:50.280]   because they're equally important to know about.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.360]   - Yeah, so let's do this again in Austin.
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:54.840]   - Absolutely, next time on your home court.
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:56.680]   - Very well, and bring a little bit of that dew
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:57.520]   if you've got it.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:58.340]   - Oh yeah.
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:18:59.180]   - Yeah.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:00.260]   - Yeah, I'll bring a low, medium, and high amount.
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:02.160]   - Low, medium, and high amount, I want to know.
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.820]   [both laughing]
[02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:05.000]   - Thanks, Peter, you're the best.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.280]   - Thanks, sir.
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.180]   - Thank you for joining me

[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:42.900]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.480]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:46.880]   we discussed supplements.
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:49.020]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:51.360]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:52.800]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:54.640]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:55.920]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.560]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.300]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed
[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.920]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:03.440]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:06.440]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman,
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:08.560]   and you can also receive 20% off.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.780]   Again, that's Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.com/huberman.
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:14.000]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.760]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:17.120]   our neural network newsletter
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.520]   is a completely zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:22.080]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:25.320]   as well as protocols, that is short PDFs
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:27.800]   describing, for instance, tools to improve sleep,
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:29.940]   tools to improve neuroplasticity.
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:32.760]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:34.040]   various aspects of mental health,
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:35.720]   again, all completely zero cost.
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.480]   And to sign up, you simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.240]   go over to the menu in the corner,
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:42.400]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:44.800]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:46.720]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:49.120]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:52.120]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn,
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:54.680]   and Facebook, and at all of those places,
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:56.680]   I talk about science and science-related tools,
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:57.720]   some of which overlaps
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:59.360]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:00.680]   but much of which is distinct
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.760]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:05.880]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:07.240]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.500]   for today's Journal Club discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:14.360]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:16.940]   [upbeat music]
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:19.520]   (upbeat music)
