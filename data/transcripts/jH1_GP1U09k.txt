[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Joshua from Fort Collins, Colorado writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, where did you
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.620]   get your foundations for such a global vision of ministry and missions?"
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.720]   My father's prayers, when I was a little boy, were laden with the glory of God.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   And I give thanks to my dad to this day, or thanks to God for him to this day.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.680]   His life was a witness to the nature of the universe as the fallen creation of God in
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.720]   desperate need of rescue by the gospel.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.320]   In other words, I grew up in a home with big things going on.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.840]   You know, the home was not about the latest TV show.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.260]   It wasn't about the latest political shenanigans.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.960]   It was about the latest rescue from hell for heaven for a glorious God who made the universe,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.380]   who exists for his glory.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.120]   And so I absorbed these things little.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.160]   And then comes, in my 20s, Jonathan Edwards' book, The End for Which God Created the World.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.440]   Oh man.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.320]   And that book just simply blew me away with the God-centeredness of God's purpose in this
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.580]   universe.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.960]   So from creation on, bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.560]   who's called by my name, whom I created for my glory.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.440]   And then I began to see it everywhere from eternity to the second coming.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.800]   Ephesians 1, 6, predestined to the praise of his glory.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.120]   The incarnation, John 12, "Father, for this purpose I have come to this hour.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.420]   Glorify your name."
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.280]   Or the propitiation on the cross in Romans 3.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.520]   This is to demonstrate God's righteousness or the giving of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.320]   He will glorify me, Jesus said.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.480]   Or the living of the Christian life.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.280]   Let your light shine that then may see your good deeds and glorify your Father.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.720]   Or dying in this world, Philippians 1, 21.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.440]   I want my Christ to be magnified in my body when I die.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.040]   Or the second coming of Christ, when he comes on that day, to be glorified in his saints
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   and to be marveled at in all who have believed.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.440]   So all over the Bible, I just began to see it everywhere after reading Edwards that God
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   is God-centered.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   God does everything for the glory of God from eternity to eternity.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.640]   In the new heavens and the new earth, God himself is going to be the sun and the lamb
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.360]   will be the lamp.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.640]   So Edwards expanded, just blew up my view of God to its proportions where it belongs
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.840]   and brought, ironically, brought the world to its appropriate tiny size.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   "Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket and are counted as dust in the scales."
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.640]   So the key to a global vision of Christianity is not to think much about Christianity, but
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.400]   to think much about God.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.360]   And then came, then came the connection between God's passion for his glory and the nations
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.320]   and my Christian hedonism.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.080]   Back in 1983, I was preaching the series of messages that became Desiring God, and the
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.920]   church asked me to preach the message on missions for the first time.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.040]   I'd been there three years.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.520]   I'd never preached on missions.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.400]   Shame on me.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.680]   I took the challenge.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.080]   I called the message, "Missions, the Battle Cry of Christian Hedonism," and everything
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.760]   came together at that moment between God's pursuit of his own glory, my pursuit of my
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.480]   joy, God's pursuit of the nations and how that would be the capstone to have all the
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.920]   nations worshiping him and all the nations satisfied in him.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.040]   And for the next 10 years then, Tony, from '83 to '93, I just threw myself into working
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.240]   out the global dimensions of this, and finally in 1993, published a book, Let the Nations
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120]   Be Glad.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.800]   And what I saw in that process was that there was a primal aim in choosing Israel that they
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.440]   would, in you, all the families of the earth will be blessed.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   And then there were promises all over the Psalms and all over the prophets, "All the
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.600]   All the families of the nations shall worship the Lord."
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.760]   And then there was the accomplishment of that on the cross where Jesus ransoms people for
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.120]   God from every tribe and tongue and people and nation, Revelation 5.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.160]   And then we get our marching orders after the cross, "Go with all authority, make disciples
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.000]   of all the nations."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.500]   And then we get a rock-solid promise from Jesus that this gospel will be preached throughout
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.520]   all the nations, and then the end will come.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.760]   I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   So it seems to me that unless or until your life is grafted into this global purpose of
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   God to be glorified through the worship of all the peoples, you're missing one great,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   joyful reason for your existence.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.380]   This is not just for an elite group of frontline missionaries.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.580]   This is for every Christian to be linked into in one way or the other, be drawing strength
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.320]   from and pouring prayers and money and time and effort and love into.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.900]   So very practically, Tony, I would say to those folks who care about this or need to
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.620]   care about this, get a copy of Patrick Johnstone's "The Church is Bigger Than You Think," and
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.060]   let your vision just be blown wide open.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.940]   That book just blew me away a few years ago when I read it, and I think it's still in
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.940]   print.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.460]   "The Church is Bigger Than You Think," and get a copy of Jason Mandrake's "Operation
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.940]   World," and begin to pray through all the nations of the world.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.700]   I prayed for Nepal this morning as I worked my way through this and saw the stunning work
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.940]   of God that he did.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.700]   I think there were about 20 Christians in Nepal back in the early '60s.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.140]   Today, there are over 800,000 Christians in Nepal under this Maoist kind of government.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:07:00.580]   God is doing stunning things in the world, and so add that to all the theological foundations.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.900]   Those are amazing stats.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.180]   And you can find more information about Pastor John's two books mentioned here, "Desiring
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.820]   God" and "Let the Nations Be Glad," and you can find more information on those at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.060]   You can also listen to that original sermon recorded on November 13, 1983, under the title
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.940]   "Missions, the Battle Cry of Christian Hedonism," and close out this podcast.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.140]   Here's a short clip from that message.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:30.660]   Missionaries are not heroes who can boast in great sacrifices for God.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.420]   They are the true Christian hedonists.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:45.400]   They are the ones who know that the battle cry of Christian hedonism is "Missions!"
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   They are the ones who have discovered the simple truth that there is 100 times more
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   joy, 100 times more satisfaction in leaving home for Christ and the gospel than a life
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:13.400]   devoted to security, comfort, and worldly advancements.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.640]   I do not appeal to you this morning to screw up your courage and make any sacrifice for
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.640]   Jesus Christ.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.040]   I had enough of that preaching when I was young that said constantly, "Do God's will,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.560]   not your will," and never told me that my will might be thrilled to obey God, which
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.120]   it is today.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.160]   I appeal to you to renounce everything in order to have the pearl of pearls.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.800]   I appeal to you to count everything as rubbish for the surpassing value of standing in the
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.820]   service of the King of Kings.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:56.080]   I appeal to you to give up all your tattered store-bought clothes in order to clothe yourself
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.200]   with the royal robes of the ambassador of the King.
