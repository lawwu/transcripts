[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.680]   In this special episode, I have with me Ben Miller, co-founder and CEO of Fundrise.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   And we're going to talk about venture capital and what's up with the innovation fund.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.640]   Welcome to the show, Ben.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.500]   So last time we spoke, you were all bulled up on real estate, which was a little bit
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.040]   different from where it was a year ago, two years ago.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.600]   So what about venture capital?
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   What's the latest happening in AI, innovation fund, and what are you all up to?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.320]   So private tech investing is so different than real estate investing.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.380]   Real estate is largely macro-driven, but technology can-- it's transformative, at least great
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.380]   technology companies.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.440]   And so you can invest into a company that could change the world, and we could be in
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.760]   a depression.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.000]   And so it's much more about getting into those great companies than it is like the sort of--
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.920]   I mean, obviously macro matters because tech multiples in 2021 were crazy.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.620]   So I'm not saying that it's only the companies that matter, but it's a very different dynamic.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.920]   And so we were lucky, we had two things happen to us in 2023.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.720]   Basically the tech fund launched and we came into the market near the bottom of venture.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.480]   Venture basically, I think, bottomed in '23.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.320]   The second thing we did was we ended up getting into among the best private tech companies
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   in the world.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.600]   Can you name some of them?
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960]   Yeah, I can name them and we can talk about it.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   When I launched this tech fund, I had some naysayers.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.680]   Sure.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   And the venture industry in particular said, "Well, you can't get into the great companies."
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.040]   That we did, which is really, really gratifying.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.920]   And so let me break them up into categories and we can talk about the specific companies.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   So basically the big thing happening in the world right now is AI.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.680]   And so we pursued AI investing in sort of three ways.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.600]   We invested into the AI companies directly, and those are like the big, large language
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   models.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.200]   We invested about 15% of the portfolios in the top AI companies.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.000]   We then invested in the data infrastructure companies.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.440]   And data infrastructure, if you're not a tech person, one way to think about that is that
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   in a gold rush, you can invest in the gold mine, or you can invest in selling picks and
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.160]   shovels to the gold miners.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.000]   So data infrastructure is the picks and shovels strategy.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.720]   So everybody who is working on AI, one way or the other, needs data infrastructure, because
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.240]   data is the lifeblood of AI.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.760]   And about half the portfolio is in data infrastructure.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   So the majority of it is in the picks and shovels kind of strategy, which is more consistent
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.880]   with my view about investing.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.600]   And then the third category are the vertical SaaS, or the applications.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800]   And we invested in a bunch of really good applications that are dominant players in
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.640]   each of their categories, but I think are amplified.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.760]   And then we had a little bit of other things, but that's like probably 90, 95% of the portfolio.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.920]   So what percentage would you say the portfolio is exposed to AI?
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.600]   I mean, I really have to look at it specifically, but I'm going to say over 90%.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.640]   I mean, it must be close to 100%.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.360]   I mean, basically, we can work backwards from the vertical SaaS companies for a second.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   But like if you take a vertical SaaS company like Canva, so we invested in Canva.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.200]   Canva is democratizing design.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.840]   And this is actually what technology does, it takes something that was really expensive
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.000]   or only available to a few people, and then makes it available to everybody.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.160]   And like, that's what, you know, E-Trade did with trading, right?
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.520]   There's so many examples.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.720]   So Canva is the dominant, absolutely dominant player in that space.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   I don't even, I don't even think it's close.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.240]   Just to put some numbers on it for you, like Adobe has a quarter trillion dollar valuation,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.560]   I think it's 250 billion last time I checked.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.160]   And Canva, if you go on Google Trends, Canva has just absolutely surpassed them on Google
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Trends.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   And they're only, I think Canva's valuation last time I checked was like 25 billion or
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.560]   10 times less.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.040]   And if you think about AI, if you go in or you and I go in, we're going to build do some
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.480]   designs for this podcast, like AI's ability to edit this podcast, produce transcript,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.360]   produce notes, produce designs for it, help us distribute it.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.880]   I mean, that's all part of what AI is going to do and doing.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.560]   And Canva is like going to be, I think, the dominant design solution for the sort of next
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   generation.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.200]   Yeah, I was kind of skeptical of AI a year ago, and I was like, oh, you know, it's like
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.800]   plagiarism and copying stuff and doing all that.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.360]   But now that I've used some of the tools to do some editing for grammar, clarity, idea
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.560]   generation, it's really increased my productivity.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.240]   So I guess the question that I have for our children, because my kids are four and six,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.120]   six and a half, is will AI be so revolutionary that it's going to take away millions of jobs
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.840]   and leave our children underemployed or unemployed, making college and grade school education
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.720]   kind of not very valuable?
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.640]   Or is it not going to be that revolutionary for those who are able to use AI and therefore
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.840]   be able to be more productive, make more money and be more free in their lives and their
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   careers?
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.040]   What's the take 10, 20 years in the future on how AI will impact our children's lives?
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.600]   Oh, man, that's, I feel like I can just repeat the smartest people out there.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.680]   I feel like it's a progression from the latter thing you said to the former.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   So I am a believer of the Raker as well, you know, the singularity or the way that the
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   chief science officer at OpenAI talks about it, Ilya, is that the neural network, it does
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.840]   replicate a lot of the way the brain works and it's really like, it is a scaling challenge
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   mostly.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   Like if we can scale the compute and the, you know, algorithms and things like that,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   I think we will see like a surprising amount of progress.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   And that's what, I mean, it's sort of everybody's seeing AI go up the hockey stick rapidly.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.120]   But then the nature of technology is that the last 20% ends up taking 80% of the time.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   And so we're going to see rapid progress and essentially, when does it slow?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.000]   When does this sort of like the linear scaling benefits run out?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.600]   Like not anytime soon.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   And I think the actual challenge is not so much the technical capacity of, we're calling
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   AI, whatever you want to call it, GPT.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.480]   It's actually the application, the human, changing human behavior.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   Like look at Zoom, the second the pandemic happened overnight, everybody changed their
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.880]   behavior and video became part of how we interact in work and life.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   And it wasn't true before.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.520]   So human behavior is actually the limiting factor, changing human behavior.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.120]   My parents shopped at department stores and my kids don't know what a department store
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   is.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.040]   I don't think it's actually going to be the application and the political and human dynamics
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.680]   and the technology is going to keep making pretty awesome progress.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.600]   And it's just going to end up being different than what we think.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.040]   It's not going to be a human being.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   We're going to have some complimentary, I mean, it's going to be really good at precise
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.080]   computation and recall, which we're not so good at, right?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.040]   But exactly where we're better and where they're, I mean, the computer came along, changed how
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.720]   we do work, made us more productive, didn't obviate the need for jobs, just created a
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.080]   different kind of job.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   I just remember being in school.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.080]   There was like the HP 12C calculator, the scientific calculator, and those who knew
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.920]   how to use it were like math geniuses.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.600]   And then those who didn't know how to use it like myself were just duds.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.480]   And I remember quitting math after sophomore year in high school.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.160]   So it feels like the lesson is you better get on board with AI and you better learn
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.400]   how to use it for your job.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.280]   Otherwise you're going to be outcompeted against by those who are more productive in knowing
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   how to use AI.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.160]   I actually think it's not really a lesson for our children because they definitely will.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.800]   It's really a lesson for people our age and, you know, if you're 20 or 30 or 40 or 50,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.160]   like if you're not embracing it, yeah, you're going to have a disadvantage.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.600]   And so just talking about Fundrise for a second, I think that's also true for companies.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.840]   Having built a company, I find companies are like people, they age, they go through maturity,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.300]   they have like cultural or personality quirks.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.880]   And so our company Fundrise, we have a team, we're building with AI and we're lucky because
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.800]   real estate, most real estate organizations have zero software engineers, like let alone,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.960]   you know, a guy within a machine learning masters and things like that.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.200]   So we're lucky to be at this intersection between tech and real estate when AI comes
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.360]   along and, you know, we've been messing around with it for a year.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.520]   And for the first 10 months, like we had nothing, we just didn't have any way to use it.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.200]   And it just was like a kind of, as you said, you can use it for like summary and, you know,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   pretty silly.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.360]   They're fine, but they're not like world changing, but we just were like, okay, we're hacked
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.640]   away at it.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.640]   And it's also how I got really, like both really confident about the kind of venture
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   investments we made, because we were building and using the softwares.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440]   And also how I think about the trajectory of it, because, you know, we set up, you know,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.680]   we have an open AI API access, we've produced things with it, things we produced were crap.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.080]   Then we had to produce again, and then we realized we needed data infrastructure, we
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.120]   got the data infrastructure.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.960]   So like, you have to use it and like learning the piano or something like, at first you're
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   terrible.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.320]   But you basically like too bad, you just have to keep going at it.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.960]   Yeah, you got to keep going at it.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.600]   And the toughest thing is, the older you get, I'm 46 now, the less you want to learn something
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   new, right?
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   You want to learn new tricks.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   It's tough.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   But you got to really force yourself if you plan to be productive, have a job, be an entrepreneur,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   you got to learn how to use it, folks, because the productivity gains are significant and
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.680]   everybody else, at least the younger folks or the hungrier folks are learning how to
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   use it.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.640]   And in terms of profitability, it's interesting, because you follow the open AI debacle with
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.480]   them outing Sam Altman and bringing him back and those debate, and now the New York Times
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.040]   is suing open AI for plagiarism and using its content illegally, I guess.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.640]   It sure seems to me that open AI, for example, is highly profit driven, because they started
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.440]   off as a nonprofit to help all of humanity, you know, they're talking about using AI to
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.920]   help cure disease and sequence this DNA and all that stuff.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.960]   But now it seems like it's about max profitability.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   What are your thoughts there in terms of running a business and also helping humanity?
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.360]   I think that's good.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.040]   It's like when I hear about a pharmaceutical company that invents something that saves
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.220]   millions of lives and they get really rich on it, I'm like, great.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.000]   So I mean, the reality is that, I mean, look, I'm not some libertarian when it comes to
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.840]   recognizing the need for regulations, but capitalism drove more people out of poverty
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.520]   in the last 30 years in China and Korea.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.000]   So I think that we're much better off with an open AI that is focused on delivering for
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.480]   the customer and getting paid for it than a government, you know, I'm sure China has
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.360]   basically like a government version of it, and I just don't expect it to move as fast
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.480]   or be as good.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.700]   But I mean, I can see also why you basically better have good government control over the
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.600]   extreme outcomes that could happen.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   This is more philosophical.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.740]   I thought we were going to talk about like the portfolio.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:24.720]   I feel like the stuff I'm saying, like everybody who's in the space who reads this stuff and
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.160]   like works with software kind of knows this stuff, but maybe I'm like too much of a nerd
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   or something.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.480]   No, I think investing, I mean, do we really want to just invest to make money?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.560]   I mean, I think we need to invest for a purpose.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.280]   We need to use our gains for something.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.240]   And I'd love to talk more about portfolio.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.960]   So the construction of the portfolio, you know, private growth companies, different
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.880]   verticals, it looks like 90% exposure to some way to AI.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.640]   I mean, if you could drill down to pure play AI companies though, what percentage of that
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.360]   portfolio are those pure play?
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   Just as I said, depending on when this podcast comes out, I believe that AI is the revolution,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.120]   you know, exactly how you feel about valuation and how many models there'll be, we can debate.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.160]   But I thought it was important, valuable to have exposure to those companies.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:21.640]   So we worked to get investments into what I think are the top AI companies.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   And that took some doing.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.960]   It's 15% of the portfolio.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.080]   So it's not, it mostly the data infrastructure and applications are where we invested, where
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.040]   I think they're much lower risk.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.360]   I mean, this company, I hear some stats, I have our average or weighted average, if you
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:46.400]   sort of dollar per, the weighted average by amount of dollars invested is a 70% annual
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   growth and over a billion dollars in revenue.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.680]   So the point of the portfolio is that these companies are like not startups, they're like
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   rat growing mature companies.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.800]   And that's basically the best kind of venture, in my opinion, is usually you can't get into
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   those companies because yes, you can get companies that are, you know, you wish you could get
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.400]   open AI at the startup or you wish you could get whatever Uber at startup.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.600]   But the problem is you also get a hundred other ones that aren't.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   Sure.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.420]   So you're saying that later stage investing in private growth companies is more attractive
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:28.120]   because it has a proven roadmap, it's growing revenue, it could be generating cashflow.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.720]   And the thing is you can't get in because everybody can see the trajectory of the company's
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.880]   growth and everybody wants in, but only a certain number of institutional investors
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.960]   or individual investors can invest.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   We got in, which was the part that the venture community said was impossible.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.800]   We were fortunate and lucky because in 2023 there was enough disruption in the market
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.640]   that we could basically provide a solution and capital and a differentiated approach
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   that allowed us to get access.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.320]   And now we have that portfolio, hopefully we can then compound that success and those
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.440]   relationships with those companies to do it again.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.680]   But you know, if you look at the portfolio, I can list some of the companies that we invested
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   in, as I said, Canva, we invested in ServiceTitan, we invested in, here's one that's interesting,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Anduril.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Familiar with them?
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   No.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.000]   So Anduril is application of AI to defense.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Defense.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   That's big bucks.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.720]   That's a well that keeps on giving.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.960]   And I believe, they are aiming to, and I believe they'll be successful in becoming the next
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.880]   prime, like the next Lockheed Martin.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.200]   And they are radically different than existing government contractors, I mean, everything
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.520]   about them is different.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   And so let me give you this, let me like state it as a problem statement.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.520]   So if you look at the future of defense versus the past, basically you were looking at fighting
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.840]   Soviet Union and that's what the defense industry was designed to do.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.480]   And that basically meant massive amounts of really expensive hardware, you know, airplanes
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.120]   and aircraft carriers, but Anduril was launched in 2017, but Ukraine has proven it out that
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.880]   the war is being driven by drones.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.400]   It loses 10,000 drones a month.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:29.840]   And so the risk of a swarm of autonomous AI controlled drones is such a radical departure
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:38.960]   from how we think about defense, a thousand low cost drones could sink a $5 billion aircraft
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.120]   carrier or attack a city.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:51.680]   And so the defense of four drones and basically how all that connects to this, sort of to
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.080]   all military hardware and the people on the ground and the air is changing rapidly.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   It's being driven by software, not by hardware.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.680]   And the primes, the big primes are not software companies.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:13.480]   And so there's just like total break in what, in the way the industry needs to work.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:20.560]   And Anduril is, I mean, I think they're like the Tesla of defense industry or they're like
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   the SpaceX of the defense industry.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.960]   They're taking a radically different approach and they're succeeding.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.440]   And so I understand there's people going to be just as worried about the risks of it,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   but you basically have to recognize how critically important it is, especially in the world,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.680]   you know, this is how Hamas surprised Israel also.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.800]   And so it's, and this is what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea today.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.920]   I mean, they're attacking with drones.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.160]   And so anyways, this is going to become critically important.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.480]   And we invested in Anduril and that was, I think, really good example of an application
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.720]   of AI that is like a sector that is going to be transformed.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.280]   No, I mean, thanks for sharing that with me.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   I didn't, I've never heard of them.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.960]   And what you said makes a lot of sense in terms of defense, saving lives, protecting
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.400]   lives and using technology and money to defend freedoms versus lives.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.560]   I mean, what's, it's pretty important stuff.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   Oh, that's fascinating.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.700]   And so whether, you know, I named the three big investments we made in applications, but
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.080]   they're each category dominant for their categories.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.200]   And same thing with data infrastructure.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.240]   Last time we talked about Databricks, they're absolutely category dominant for data industry.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.920]   And we also invested in DBT Labs.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.080]   And I don't know if you have to be a data nerd to know probably that much about them,
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.920]   but basically they are the essential software for data industry.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.500]   Like anybody who's a data professional, data scientist, data engineer uses them.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:06.880]   They've really transformed how data is transformed, how data is transformed and understood inside
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   our organizations.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.120]   It did it for us.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.840]   We have a lot of data, our real estate and investors, and we adopted DBT a couple of
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.640]   years ago and it just absolutely changed how we built and what was possible.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.360]   And then we wanted to see them, we want to invest in you.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.480]   And we ended up actually, they ended up using our, us, Fundrise and the application of DBT
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.360]   is like a marketing case study.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.160]   So I spent a lot of time trying to build a relationship with them and then we were able
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160]   to invest in them.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.960]   And they're a singular company.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.400]   There's nobody that's like a number two and they are essential and transformative.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.160]   So that's a company that most people have never heard of.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   And it's just awesome.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.720]   It's awesome that we invested in them.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   They're awesome.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.000]   It really sounds like a great plan in terms of your value add to be an investor in these
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   companies.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.400]   Because if you're like, let's say a VC at a VC shop, right, you've got relationships.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.880]   So your value add is, well, you have a good track record, you know, other portfolio companies,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.440]   you can make introductions, help with hiring and marketing, whatnot.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   But for Fundrise, it's like, you've got connections, you've got a team, you've got a company, you've
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.760]   got dollars, you can also become a client and help spread the good word about the company
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   as well.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.720]   So to me, it seems like y'all have a competitive advantage over a traditional VC who is not
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.800]   actually implementing that product in a, you know, a multi hundred person company.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.360]   I think we have a small advantage and a big advantage.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.340]   The small advantage is that when I'm talking to somebody at those companies, I'm talking
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.040]   to a peer, I'm a customer, I understand the product, we use the product, we literally
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.320]   use almost all the products we've invested in.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.760]   And I think that makes us just a very different counterparty.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.080]   And then second, you know, we have 2 million users and we are a marketing distribution
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   platform.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.000]   You know, I was talking to one of our companies, we told them we were going to send an investor
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.100]   update out, I don't know, a million people, and they're like, "What's it cost us?
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.100]   How much do we pay you?"
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.880]   Yeah, you get the exposure if you let us invest in you.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:21.160]   I mean, we, you know, millions of customers, potential customers, brand awareness, potentially
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.600]   if they ever go public, those are millions of retail investors.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.880]   I think about Databricks as an example.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.400]   Most people never heard of them and they're going to go public probably in the next couple
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   of years.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.500]   And the more people know about them, the more I think they'll be impressed.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.160]   And so there's like, I mean, there's just a value to the brand awareness that we can
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.000]   bring that's distinct or, as you said, competitive advantage over traditional venture funds who
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   bring a different value.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.360]   I mean, I'm not going to try to bring the kind of value venture funds bring.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   That's not realistic.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   Right.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   No, it's interesting.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.060]   Can we transition to talk about how an investor invests in an open-ended permanent venture
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.280]   capital fund, such as the innovation fund?
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.640]   Because as you told us in a previous episode, when we're talking about real estate, time
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.820]   is linear, but things happen in a non-linear fashion.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.640]   And so the good thing about innovation fund is you can click on the link and you can see
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.280]   what y'all are holding and then you can make a determination based on your holding, whether
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.640]   you want to invest and how much.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.920]   But the way venture or private companies get valued is pretty chunky, right?
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.320]   It's like a revaluation upward or downward after another funding round.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.480]   So can you talk to us about the mechanics of, if someone wants to invest, they look
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.520]   at the portfolio like, this is great, I'm going to invest a thousand bucks, $10,000.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.960]   How do they capture the returns of the fund?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   Yes.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.080]   I mean, this is, to some extent, the same thing happens in real estate where you basically
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.560]   have private market and public market and people in the public market transact every
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.920]   second and expect change to happen every second.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.440]   In the private markets, it's a real world, right?
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.480]   Like you're building companies, you're building buildings, you're under construction with
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.240]   a 200 unit apartment building.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.200]   What's the value of the building when the concrete's up and the roof's on and the glass
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.040]   is in, but you haven't put in the toilets?
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.280]   It's really difficult because if you would look at that building and say, once it's opened
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.480]   and there's a certificate of occupancy, then it's a completed building and there's like
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.560]   a binary change.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   And the same thing happens with tech companies, like they're worth a hundred million and then
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.320]   they raise a round and they're worth a billion.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.880]   And the day before they raised, were they worth a hundred million, the day after they
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.000]   raised, are they worth a billion?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.120]   And that's a very challenging dynamic in the private markets because in both instances
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:50.080]   where there's a building or a company, the change didn't happen overnight.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   But when the building is completed and people are living in it, there is a step change difference.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.840]   Like when the company gets valued by a venture fund and they raise a billion dollars, there
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.960]   is a step change difference.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:09.140]   So we need to look at both sets of data, data that's binary, like if something changes,
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.000]   that's an event, like a fundraising round, that's easy.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.100]   And data that's non-binary, that's incremental, like the revenue's increased or they got a
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.120]   new big customer enterprise sale.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:28.080]   And take today, today we've built a pretty remarkable private portfolio or portfolio
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.480]   of private companies, but we can't really revalue them until there's some external input
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.520]   that changes the facts.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.620]   I mean, you make venture investments, you know that it takes a while before you really
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.480]   see external changes in the valuation.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.080]   In terms of the fund mechanics though, so let's say a company was valued at a hundred
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.600]   million, raises capital, and now it's valued at 500 million.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.680]   How does, and let's say the innovation fund holds that company, do you all revalue the
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.120]   company to be worth 500 million or do you have discretion to say, well, it's not 500
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.980]   million, you have a discount at 250 million?
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.480]   How much discretion do you have to value these companies or what is the standard practice?
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.680]   Well, so our valuations get audited.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.920]   Every single investment gets audited by our auditor.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:23.440]   So it's part of the fund structure that we're in, which is a 1940 Act registered investment
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   company.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.400]   So they show up and they basically do independent valuation as well.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.920]   And you know, but ultimately like even when a venture fund invests in a company, right,
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.680]   they're doing independent valuation.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.640]   And so typically there's like a whole book, there's this massive book that's put out about
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.680]   how you look at valuation and the best way to value something is a third-party independent
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.440]   transaction like a public market IPO or a third-party venture fund.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.720]   And that's basically likely to end up being the valuation we would take.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.680]   But if it was an inside round, right, if an inside round, and so are they as independent?
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.140]   That's more challenging.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.880]   Like were there structured terms in it?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.480]   Okay, headline valuation 500, but there are all these structured terms around pref multiples
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.040]   and cram downs and things like that.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.120]   So yeah, you can't just look at the headline and take that valuation.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.600]   You have to look at the fundamentals of the business and you have to look at the terms
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   of it.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   Got it.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   Okay.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   All right.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.440]   So it's a little bit of an art as well as a science.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.240]   You know, as an investor, let's say I have a view that, okay, things are getting better.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   Okay.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   Rates are coming down.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   Risk appetite is going up.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.480]   Public equities are up, you know, 24% for the S&P 500 in 2023.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.840]   M&A is probably likely going to come back.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.160]   The IPO market is likely going to come back.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.840]   There's going to be a window of opportunity for private companies to go public.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.080]   Therefore, would it not be strategic to look at companies that are at the cusp of going
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.480]   public and invest in them before they go public to then capture that upside?
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.960]   I mean, obviously the IPO valuation could decline, but in general, in a bull market
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.160]   or in a growing risk appetite market, those valuations are going to continue to increase.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.640]   So what do you think about that strategy?
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.160]   Well, I mean, without naming names, because one of the things I have to be sensitive to
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.960]   is the companies don't want me talking about them and, right, I mean, I'm not their CEO.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:25.080]   But if you look at our portfolio, the three most likely, sort of most exciting next companies
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.440]   to go public are in our portfolio.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   And we can all see that.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.200]   And I think we can all make a deduction as to which ones they could be.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.840]   And I think that'll be very validating for people.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.360]   I mean, again, the funny thing about tech is that unless you're in the tech industry,
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.840]   you really haven't heard of all these companies.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:48.800]   You know, we're not talking about name brands in most cases, but it's, yeah, I believe that
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.640]   some of these companies will go public the next year or two.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.440]   I think that they're really good companies.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.960]   There's no question about that in my mind.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.880]   And exactly how the market values it, again, I'm not a short-term investor.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.960]   Even when some of these great companies went public, it didn't mean that they were no longer
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   a good investment.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.940]   You know, we have to have some of the fund in liquid assets because investors redeem
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.400]   every quarter.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:18.680]   And so the way we did that in 2023, and even now we have the portfolio in bonds of tech
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.120]   companies, we basically felt like when we started deploying the innovation fund that
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.200]   our investors were not looking for us to take like a kind of public market risk that they
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.760]   could take themselves.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.440]   So we focused on private tech companies and then we had the rest of the portfolio in public
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.240]   tech bonds, which actually are not that easy to buy.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   They usually hold lots or a million dollars and most people aren't buying public tech
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   bonds.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   And so we got pretty good yields.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.960]   I mean, it was a good time to buy tech bonds.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.040]   And so we have to have some of the portfolio in liquid assets in order basically to have
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.920]   this sort of hybrid fund, this crossover fund, democratize investing in private markets because
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   otherwise there'd be no liquidity and investors expect some limited amount of liquidity when
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.560]   they invest.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.000]   So let's say one of your portfolio companies goes public next year, there's a six month
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.720]   lockup period after IPO.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.560]   What is the decision process then in terms of selling in the public market to capture
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.920]   that gain and liquidity, riding it out?
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.160]   Is there some type of standard which you all will operate or is it dependent?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.840]   No, it's going to be a kind of a micro decision, ground up.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.560]   You look at the company, look at what basically is where it's pricing, it's growth, etc.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.520]   And then you look at the portfolio.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.080]   And one of the great things about private markets, it's a funny thing about private
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.880]   markets is actually in some instances you get more information than public markets.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.080]   Like a venture investor who invests in a company gets way more information than a public market,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.120]   you know, S1.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.280]   And so today, at least if you look at the construction of the portfolio, the macros
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.960]   we've invested in are really early in their growth cycle.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.040]   AI is like a year old.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   I mean, I don't think we would be a seller, I think we'd be like, one of the reasons a
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.520]   company like, well, I'm not going to say a name, but a company takes your money because
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.040]   they want you to be a long-term holder.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   They don't want somebody to just trade you, right?
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.880]   That's actually not a value-add partner.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.480]   And so to get the best companies, you need to be like Warren Buffett.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.280]   You need to be low touch, you know, helpful if they want your help and a long-term investor.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.720]   That's how you basically, I think, attract the type of companies that we want to invest
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   in.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   Right.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   No, no, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   You don't want to be, you know, I don't know, the hedge fund investor who buys on a Monday
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.880]   and sells on a Friday after a 15% pop, right?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.600]   You want to be long-term value-added, you're right, low touch, not a PITA.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.760]   Every time we sell, we trigger capital gains, right?
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.160]   The investor gets these capital gains flow down to them so that the investor doesn't
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.800]   want, capital gains are a huge waste of, you lose, what is it, 37% between state and federal,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   maybe 40.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   Right.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.360]   I'm just thinking down the line, let's say five years from now, you know, more companies
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.400]   may go public, probably will go public in the portfolio.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:19.600]   And so eventually the mix might be a greater percentage of public company exposure versus
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.160]   private company exposure.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.520]   Because right now it's...
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.600]   That's not our mandate though.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.800]   I mean, our mandate is to be vast majority private.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   Right.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.640]   Currently, it absolutely is, and I think we can maintain that.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   If I look at my lessons from 2021, if we were basically, we wouldn't be making a decision
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.200]   that private markets are overpriced and we would be like not investing in predominantly
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.640]   maybe back to bonds or something because you, part of what the structure of our funds can
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.520]   do, which most people can't, most funds can't either, is that you can be in, you can be
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.680]   allocating to private or public.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.840]   And that arbitrage between where the multiples or prices are more attractive, it's really
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.080]   uncommon, not just for individual investors, but even institutions like venture funds can't
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   really invest in public stock and public funds can't invest in private.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   And that's like an arbitrage opportunity.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   Right.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   Right.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.940]   Well, sounds pretty promising.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:22.560]   In conclusion, what are your thoughts for, I guess, the rest of 2024 and maybe a little
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.520]   bit 2025 in the venture capital land?
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:31.720]   I mean, the venture industry is basically today operating basically in two different
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.640]   environments.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.400]   Anything that's AI is basically priced like it's 2021.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.260]   Anything that's not AI is almost unpriced, almost unpriced.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:50.400]   You have amount of venture capital dollars declined by 50, 60% in the last two years.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.880]   So there's a good sign for investors, but at the same time, there's still markdowns
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.760]   from the peak that haven't happened yet.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   And so there's a lot of work.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.440]   I mean, the same thing with real estate, right?
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.840]   There's still a lot of change or reality to bring to bear on both industries.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.200]   And that's going to take time.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.320]   The good thing about our fund structure is we don't have to be in a hurry.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.360]   So we got a lot of good investments in 2023, and then we may slow down unless we see something
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   good, right?
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.960]   There's no reason to deploy.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.320]   All right.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.920]   Well, it seems like we're also passing the bottom for the venture capital industry, just
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.400]   like we're passing the bottom for the real estate industry.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.320]   So in other words, it sounds like you are very optimistic and bullish, just like I am.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   Optimistic.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.040]   Are you optimistic too?
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.560]   If we're aligned again, there's something.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560]   I'm very optimistic.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.640]   I mean, I live in San Francisco.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.600]   We're a startup city of the world.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.720]   All the AI companies are here.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.440]   Everywhere I go, everybody's talking about AI, whether I'm on the pickleball court, whether
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.600]   I'm playing tennis, I'm in the library, whatever, AI, AI, nonstop, or even at the Starbucks
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.120]   with some guy's laptop out.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.240]   So it's everywhere.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.880]   I'm maybe a little bit worried about valuations.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.120]   How are those going to shake out?
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:15.160]   But it sounds to me that investing in AI long term is worth it.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.240]   And if you want to hedge against an interesting future, you want to have some exposure to
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   AI.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.720]   And so that's what I'm going to be doing.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.480]   And I want to thank you for having this open-ended fun where the investment minimum is only $10
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   and there's liquidity.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.560]   Well, thanks so much for coming on the Financial Samurai podcast, Ben.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.680]   And maybe what we can do is a mid-year checkup to see how things are going and whether that
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.720]   optimism remains in both real estate and venture.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.240]   Yeah, that would be great.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.600]   I love our conversations.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   All right.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   And when you come out to San Francisco, we're going to grab a beer, hopefully, what in March,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.760]   and we'll reconvene then.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   All right, everyone.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   Thanks so much for listening.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.960]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, don't forget to subscribe, share and review.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.400]   We will talk to you all later.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.700]   Thanks everyone for listening to the conversation I had with Ben Miller, CEO and co-founder
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.000]   of Fundrise about his outlook for venture capital in 2024 and beyond.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:21.200]   If you would like to explore the open-ended Fundrise Innovation Fund, you can go to financialsamurai.com/innovation.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.160]   Unlike traditional closed-end venture capital funds, where you commit capital and then hope
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.000]   the fund makes wise investment decisions, you can first see what type of investments
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.180]   the Innovation Fund has made first before deciding on if and how much to invest.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:42.120]   Fundrise is a longtime sponsor of Financial Samurai and Financial Samurai is an investor
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.880]   in Fundrise Funds.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.460]   Lastly, if you enjoyed this episode, I'd appreciate a rate, review and a share.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.620]   Every single episode takes hours to record, edit and produce.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.120]   Thanks so much.
