[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I have a special treat for you.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   A joint show with my friend David Stein,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   who is the host of the excellent
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Personal Finance and Investing podcast
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   called Money for the Rest of Us.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Back on episode 466 in June of 2017,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I recorded an episode called
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   The USA's Long-Term Fiscal Gap
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and Why It Matters to You.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   America's Fiscal Insolvency and Its Generational Consequences.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And I read an essay by Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I believe I read his testimony that he presented
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   to the US Congress on the subject of
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   what is referred to as the unfunded liabilities
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   of the US government.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Unfunded liabilities are those promises
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   that have been made to citizens
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   of promises of benefits,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   but promises that have not been paid for
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   nor has money been allocated to those benefits.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Well, after I published that show,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I received an email from David.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He wrote to me and he said,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   "Joshua, I think you're wrong about this."
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And we intended to get together and record it,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   but I pulled off during the fourth quarter of 2017
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and the first quarter of 2018.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I pulled back from doing a bunch of interviews
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and we didn't get it done until now,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   where I recently got together with him
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   to debate this subject.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So the audio you're about to hear
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   is David and me sitting down
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and trying to figure out who's right.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And I think you'll hear the challenge of that.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   David is a really knowledgeable guy.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He worked for many years as an institutional investor
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and now, of course, is his own private investor.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And then he teaches investing on his podcast,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Money for the Rest of Us.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And I would say that the two of us would represent
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   a fairly mainstream perspective in our experience.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He came from the world of institutional investment advice.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I came from the world of personal financial planning
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and personal investment advice.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But both of us were involved in fairly mainstream approaches
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   to investing.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But yet, both of us are trying to figure out the answers
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   to these difficult questions,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   as is anybody who's involved in the world of investing,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   which is, sadly or appropriately, all of us.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And so I hope you enjoy this discussion
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   as we try to wrestle through some of these issues.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   This show does not have a lot of facts and figures.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We chose to focus on the simple audio discussion,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   but I still think it can serve you.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You'll hear this audio in a couple different parts.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   David's show is usually about 30 minutes long,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and so we were trying very hard to fit
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   that time constraint for his show.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   But I was still frustrated at the end of 30 minutes
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   that I didn't feel like we'd arrived at an answer.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So how could an episode of Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   be only 30 minutes, especially an interview?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So I finished the show, and then I said,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "David, we've got to get to the bottom of this,"
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and thus you'll hear the difference in the audio.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So enjoy this conversation between me
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and my friend David Stein.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   David Stein, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So a number of months ago, I recorded a show
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   talking about the future of basically
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   the U.S. government economic situation,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   the fiscal situation.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And in that show, I talked extensively about
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Lawrence Kotlikoff's discussion of the unfunded liabilities
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   of the U.S. government, and I started the process
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   of declaring my position on the unsustainability
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   of current U.S. government and fiscal policies.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's my personal opinion that the U.S. government
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and the U.S. American culture is effectively bankrupt,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   and that the process of that bankruptcy
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   will proceed forward over the coming decades.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't know a time, but it'll take--
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   over the coming decades, we'll see that bankruptcy
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   more and more become apparent, the great default,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   as some people have termed it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Now, after that show, you emailed me,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   and you said, "Joshua, I don't agree with you."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And in that email, you said, "Let's talk about it."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So here we are, months too late,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   but we're finally getting back to talking about it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So what I thought would be fun is let me, in short,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   describe my understanding, and I want to keep today's show
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   free of a lot of numbers and detail.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That's better discussed in writing.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But I'll very briefly describe my position,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and then I want to hear your position
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and hear what you believe and don't believe.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It seems to me that if I do an analysis
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   of the last century of U.S.-American spending
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and government policy, it seems like we have made commitments
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   on the level of government that we will never be able to keep.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Most importantly, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   or I guess I should rephrase that order--
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   are effectively bankrupt.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   They don't have enough money to cash the promises
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   that they have made.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so over the coming decades,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I expect those to be, over time, defaulted on
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   in a myriad of ways.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And I look at the political situation in the United States,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and I see no possibility.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I see no political impetus.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I see no one who's standing and saying,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   "Let's stop borrowing money. Let's pay our bills.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "Let's actually balance our budget.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   "Let's actually figure out how to run
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   on the money that we take in.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "Let's figure out how to adjust taxes and revenue
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   "to be at least equal, let alone pay off debt."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   What do you think?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Well, I think it gets back to what is money.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   In other words, a lot of the analogies--
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   the U.S. is like a business or a household,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   so it has constraints, but it doesn't.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   The government's money--
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   essentially, it's magic money.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Money is digital.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And so when we look at what happens
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   when the government spends, it's not--
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   doesn't have to sit there and wait
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   for this money to show up.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And so when you go back to what Kotlikoff,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   in his generational accounting,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   he's looking at all these promised payments,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and he discounts them into today's dollars,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and he looks at the potential tax revenue
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and discounts it to today's dollar,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   and there's this huge fiscal gap.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But the U.S. government has run a deficit
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   basically forever since it's been around,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and if--think about it in terms of monopoly money.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   If it was just monopoly money,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   we wouldn't have these things.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So while I might agree with you
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   that there's some fundamental decline
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   in the U.S. government,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I don't think--
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   there's not a fiscal constraint.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And we have examples of that.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   We have Japan that has a much greater debt
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to GDP than the U.S.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But what do you have happening?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You have the Japanese central bank
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   effectively buying that national debt.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   They now own 40%.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   They've bought it out of money
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   they created out of thin air.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But that doesn't mean there's no constraints,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   and that's where I think it's the key.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's not that the government can spend
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   as much as it wants,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   because the wealth of a country
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   is the ability of the private sector
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   to produce goods and services that we can eat.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So if a government like Venezuela
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   is spending ridiculous amounts of money
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   and buying off its population,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   yet has destroyed the private sector,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   then you have massive inflation
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   because you have essentially
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   a collapsing economy.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There's not enough food.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   The government's spending money,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and you have hyperinflation.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But in an economy like the U.S.,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   where you have a robust private sector,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and our deficits are small
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   relative to the size of the economy,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   we can continue indefinitely
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   like we've been doing
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and have done for centuries.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And it's not going to be a collapse
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   based on accounting.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   If there's going to be a collapse,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   it's going to be based on
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   a morally bankrupt government
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   that doesn't follow the rule of law.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So interestingly,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I just have been reading--
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I'm late to the party.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I've been aware of it for a time,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   but I've just been reading
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   David Stockman's book,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   The Great Deformation.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Are you familiar with that book
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   or have you ever read it?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I am, and I don't necessarily
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   agree with him either.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Right.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So I know a lot of people--
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He's a very, of course, divisive figure.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But I've not read the book.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I've read reviews.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I might have started it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I'm only partway into it,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   but it's something I've been
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   really grappling with this question.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He lays out a very strong case
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   that in the 2008 financial collapse,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   that the moral connection
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   between the natural free market system
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and the government getting involved,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that that moral connection was broken.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And he makes a very strong case
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   that all of the governmental intervention
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   was unnecessary.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Now, I also read the official U.S. report
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   that was issued by the inquiry
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   into the financial collapse,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and of course they would disagree
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   with one another.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So the moral dimension is one thing,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   but let's stick with the--
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I agree.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Go ahead.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I don't think the government
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   should have intervened.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Right, okay.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   How they do.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And I don't necessarily agree
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   that the Federal Reserve
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   should be creating money
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   as part of the quantitative easing program.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I don't think that was necessary.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But that's separate from the fact
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   that they can.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So I think I have to acknowledge,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   and I want to acknowledge,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   that for all of the talk
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   of doomsday and collapse
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   that we've seen people talk about
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   for decades,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   it hasn't happened yet.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So those who say it's inevitable
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   have to reconcile,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   well, it hasn't happened yet,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and lots of people have said
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   it was inevitable long ago.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   But do you think there is a limit
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   with regard to deficit spending?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Do you think there is a limit?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And if there is, what would it be?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Because after I recorded that show,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I had a listener who seemed
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   very well informed write to me
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and said, "Joshua, you're wrong,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "and you're wrong because you think
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "that there's a limit."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And we've proven that there effectively
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   is no limit on government spending,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and what you need to do is read
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   this, this, this, this,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   which demonstrate that there's no limit.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   The government continue to do this
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   because, as you say,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   the government controls the monetary supply.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   They can print more money.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   They can always satisfy their obligations
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   because there is effectively no limit.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   No, and the limit is the ability
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   of the private sector to produce.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You're seeing Venezuela as a country
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   where they've met their limit.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   They have impeded the ability
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   of farmers to grow crops.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   They don't have enough food.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And it didn't matter that the government
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   can create money out of thin air,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   can create cryptocurrencies,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   because there isn't enough to eat.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And so that's the fundamental limit.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Where there's not a limit,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and oftentimes people, you'll see articles
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   that don't understand how
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   the monetary system works,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   will say, "Well, our grandchildren
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "are going to have to pay for this debt
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "that we've incurred."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Now think about that.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Has anybody come to you
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   from your great-great-grandparents
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   asking for the debt that the government
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   took on beginning of this century?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   - I would say yes, but in this way,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that a significant portion
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   of the federal expenditure,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I don't have the number in front of me,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   but I would say, what, 15, 20%
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   of the federal expenditure
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   is currently spent on interest,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   no, it would be less than that,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   interest on the federal debt.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And that debt has accumulated
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   since World War II.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So we are still currently paying interest.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   - Oh yeah, we pay interest on it,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   but nobody's collected it,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   because what is government debt?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It's assets of most of us.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   In other words, that interest
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   flows right back into the economy,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   and it becomes income.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   You always have to look at
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   who's on the other side
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   of the balance sheet.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Government debt are household assets.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And what is creating that debt each year?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Because one of the things people talk about,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   we need to have a balanced budget.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Well, the government can set
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   what they want to spend.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   They really don't have control
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   over the revenue,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   because that is determined
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   by the decisions of households
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and businesses,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   how much they want to save.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And let me just give a brief example.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Just think of, if businesses
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and households decide
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   that they want to save more,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   that means they spend less.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And if they spend less,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   then they're buying less
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   from other households and businesses,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   which means their income drops,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   which ultimately means
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   that there's less tax revenue.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Because if businesses,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   if people are trying to save more,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and businesses are trying to save more
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   by spending less,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   then other businesses
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   aren't going to have as much income.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   People aren't going to have many jobs,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   so there'll be less tax revenue,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and that naturally puts the government
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   into a deficit position.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Even if the budget was balanced
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   at the beginning of the year,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   we're going to spend, whatever,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   $5 trillion here,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   and we hope to get
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   $5 trillion in revenue,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   as soon as the household
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and business sector decide
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   they don't want to spend as much,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   then the revenue drops,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   the tax revenue.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And that's why we naturally
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   have bigger deficits
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   during times of recession,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   because of unemployment benefits.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But it's ultimately
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   the fiscal situation
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   of the federal government
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   is determined
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   by households and businesses.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Assuming that the government
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   isn't out of control
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   in terms of its spending.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I mean, there has to be
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   some basic understanding
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   as we're not going to be
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   like Venezuela, right?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And if we don't have that,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   then we're in trouble.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And I used to have optimism
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   that perhaps somebody,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   especially the Republicans,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   who ran on the idea
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   that we're going to be
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   fiscally constrained,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I used to have optimism
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   that the Republicans
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   might follow through
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   at some point.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   But with this recent,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   what I would term a boondoggle,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   with this recent boondoggle
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   of tax bill a few months ago
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and spending bill
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that was passed
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   by Republican-controlled
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Congress and Senate
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and signed by a Republican president,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I have lost any optimism
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   that there's any serious politician,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   with the exception of maybe Rand Paul,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   who staged some theatrical objections.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But it seems like
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   there's almost nobody
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   who actually stands
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   for fiscal constraint.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So I've lost that optimism.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But let me go back.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Let's talk about coffee.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Go ahead.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   - Hang on a second.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I don't, yes,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   but I don't think
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   they're out of control.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   In other words,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   we could run a 3% to 4%
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   deficit to GDP indefinitely.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   We've done it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And it's just,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   it's been done.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And it goes back to showing,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   when is the collapse gonna occur
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   from a fiscal standpoint?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Japan has twice as much debt
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   to GDP as the US.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   So 240% debt to GDP.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We're about 103%.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And Japan is doing just fine
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   and doesn't have issues
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   with inflation
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   because their population
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   is shrinking.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   And so again,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   the constraint is,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   is there enough people
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   to produce the goods and services?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And it'll be interesting to see
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   because Japan will get into trouble
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   way, way sooner than the US.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   If there is a constraint,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Japan is gonna get in trouble.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   But right now,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   it's just not there.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   - Okay, so here's the point though.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   The numbers that you're referencing
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   are on-book liabilities.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The official federal debt
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   as is calculated,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   which is what,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   20 trillion-ish?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   - Yeah, 20 trillion.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   - About 20 trillion.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Whereas what Kotlikoff's point is,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   is the unfunded liabilities,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   which in his estimation,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   depending on the year of his work,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   range anywhere from 180 to 200 trillion dollars.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And what he's describing there
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   is the commitments,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   the promises that are made
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   to the recipients of Medicaid,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Medicare, and Social Security
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   that are not accounted for
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   in official on-budget debt.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   And so here's where,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   in my guess,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I've spent about a decade
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   kind of thinking about this.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And a decade ago
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   when I started to think about it,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I had this impression that,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   well, one day,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   the federal government's just gonna run out of money,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and they're not gonna,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   that's not possible
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   unless you have a society in anarchy.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Because the power behind the US dollar
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   as a made-up currency
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   without any fundamental connection
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   to anything constraining,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   the power is the taxing authority
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   of the entity,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   of the state behind it,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and the state's ability to use force
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   to enforce their taxation.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And so on that basis,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   the US government can always
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   write any number of checks that they want
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   because they have the monopoly
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   or the majority of force,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and so they can force tax revenue,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and they can just write checks.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But the problem is,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   what are those checks worth
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   when they actually get there?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And so I don't see any way
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   that all of a sudden
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   that all of the hoopla
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   over government shutdowns notwithstanding,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   which is just, in my mind,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   political theater,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I don't think that at some point in time
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   you just stop,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   that the US government stops writing checks.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   But I do think that the value
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   of what is promised
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   continually constricts.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And it goes back to the world of financial planning.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   What did I tell when I was working
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   as a financial planner?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   What did I tell all of my younger clients?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And it was just a standard
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   in the world of professional financial planning.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Don't plan on Social Security.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now that's just the tip of the iceberg
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   because Social Security
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   is one of the healthier ones.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   When you go to Medicare and Medicaid
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   and you look at the numbers that are required,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   there's no way that I don't see any way
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   that those promises can be fulfilled.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And that's what I refer to as default.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   - Well, and again, that's the,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   first off, my issue with Kotlikoff
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   is it takes everything from the future
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and puts it in the present.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   We do this year by year.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   So five years from now,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   when it comes to Social Security and Medicare,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   the government can create the money.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I think we at least agree on that.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   - Right, I agree.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   - The issue is, will it be any doctors
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   or hospitals to service the retirees that are sick?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And that's the constraint.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   If they've created money
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   and there's not enough doctors
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   because everybody's retired,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   then we're gonna have inflation.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   But through advances in artificial intelligence, robotics,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   just productivity increases.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   If there's a private sector that can,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   it's a question of accounting.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Get the money to the retirees
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   so they can pay the doctors that are there.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Now, if the doctors already have too much business
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   and there's not enough doctors,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   then you have inflation.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That's the constraint.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   The constraint isn't the accounting.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And great example.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So I used to have one of my clients
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   as an institutional advisor was a retirement home.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And they had a $30 million portfolio.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   But they also had financial statements.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So every year in their financial statements,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   they would have their fees that they'd collect.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   But a big portion was realized gains.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And then they would have their expenses.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So they had their wealth,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   which was their actual investments,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   but they had their financial statements.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And I remember one year, the CFO came to me and said,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   "We don't have enough gains
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   "because my financial statement shows we're losing money."
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Yet their portfolio was up that year.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And so I suggested, well, we could sell some stocks
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and realize the gains from an accounting perspective.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And she's like, "No, we can't turn the portfolio."
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But in fact, that's what she wanted.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   She wanted her accounting statement to look better fiscally
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   when their wealth over here was their actual investment assets
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   with a ton of unrealized gains.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   It's the same with this type of generational accounting.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   The balance sheet looks terrible.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   The government has always been insolvent
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   because it always spends more money than it receives.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   The issue is the wealth.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   The wealth are the people and the households, the businesses.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Will they be able to supply enough goods and services,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   including medical treatment, for the populace?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   We can take care of the accounting issues,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   getting the money from whatever other people,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   but if we don't have the capacity to produce,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   then we're in trouble.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So for the sake of argument, let me grant your point.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Let's assume that accounting doesn't matter
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   because I concur with your point.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Somebody who has a failing business and mountains of debt
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   isn't necessarily doomed to guaranteed bankruptcy.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   They can't create money either.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Correct, which is always--
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   the government has a monopoly on money creation
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and on force to extract tax revenue.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   But let's go then back to a realistic accounting of the future
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   because those financial decisions are predicated upon
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   the productivity of the sector, the health of the economy.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And I would dissent with your point that the government
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   has always been insolvent, the US government.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I don't see that in history.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   It seems as though there have been times of insolvency.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Right after the Revolutionary War,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   the early US-American government inflated like crazy,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   but it's gone through periods.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   But for the last, say, since the early first quarter
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   of the 20th century, there has been this continual trend
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   towards increasing levels of debt, increasing promises, etc.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Because it loses money every year.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I mean, when I say insolvent, I'm saying they're--
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   like most businesses cannot lose money every single year.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I mean, they're effectively insolvent, and the government can,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   but by some definitions, it would be insolvent.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So now let's talk about cultural capital.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And I'm so torn on these issues because on the one hand,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I can't deny that Wall Street--
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   for the sake of using a very collectivized term--
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Wall Street has been deeply productive with their assets.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Wealth is growing.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But I don't see the same strength reflected in the US-American culture.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I see a very sick US-American culture,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and I'm concerned with the idea that there is enough cultural capital
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   to sustain through for decades.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And so am I.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   What do you think?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Oh, exactly.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And I've talked a lot about some of those issues on my show
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   in terms of income inequality, just the state of education,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   just the state of ethics.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   If people-- because money is trust.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And if we no longer have trust as a society,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   if we don't trust our neighbors, if we don't trust businesses,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   if we don't trust government, then you're right.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   We're in serious trouble.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But what bugs me is the focus doesn't get put on that.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   It gets put on the government's balance sheet.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And we get into this, we need to balance the budget.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Why don't we focus-- why don't we understand what money is
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and understand since we're no longer on the gold standard
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   that we can create as much money as we want,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   why don't we make sure we have policies that assure
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   that decades down the road we have a functioning private sector,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   a productive private sector, an educated private sector.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   That's what worries me, not accounting issues
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   regarding how money is created, et cetera.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Because all the evidence shows to date
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   that between the central bank and the U.S. government,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   the money can be created.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   What's not clear is whether hopefully the private sector
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   will still function in the decades down the road.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   But we can take it year by year and hopefully solve these issues,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   but not get distracted by this sideshow of the national debt.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Where do you see reasons for optimism at the moment?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I am really excited by the--
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   first off, I think people are fundamentally good.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I've been traveling for three months,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   or I guess a month and a half now.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And people are good, and they want good things.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And a lot of people are trying.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And we certainly have problems, but I think by and large,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   society are good people trying to do the best for their families.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   That's a positive.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I think the flexibility, the freedom we still have
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   to start businesses here, and we don't have--
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   people complain about red tape, but it's so much easier
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   to start a business here in Cuba where they've effectively
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   outlawed any private business other than running a restaurant,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   running out a room in your house, driving a taxi.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   That's it.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Here we have that flexibility.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I think the advances in robotics, in artificial intelligence,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   the ability--our ability to produce goods and services
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   is growing dramatically.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Now, that's creating potentially unemployment problems
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   to where we might have everything we need,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   but nobody has a job because we can create so much.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   That's a potential issue.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Again, that's an accounting issue.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   How do we get money to the people?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   But if we have the goods and services,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   then I'm optimistic about that.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So I'll give you my list, and then I'll ask for your list
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   of what you're concerned about.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   My list would be, number one, I'm encouraged
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   by the decentralization of information.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I'm encouraged that now a 10-year-old child
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   in the poorest neighborhood of the United States
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   or even the world can access the knowledge of the world
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   through a $40 smartphone, and I'm deeply encouraged about that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm encouraged about the decentralization
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   of education and schooling.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I think that by the leader, for example, Salman Khan
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   with the Khan Academy, I think that he is the harbinger
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   of just a massive change in education.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I don't function--I don't live in kind of mainstream circles,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but I don't know--I hardly know any young couples
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   who are parents who are sending their children
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   to government schools.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Almost everybody is looking for other alternatives,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and I see that as a great opportunity for children
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   to be trained, and instead of being stultified
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   and dumbed down by the monopoly on education,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I see that as positive.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   I agree with you as far as the ability to start businesses.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I still live in the United States of America
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   simply because I don't know anywhere better.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   If there were better, I would go,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   but I don't know anywhere better, and it is much easier
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   to start businesses in the United States than that.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So I agree with you on those things,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and I see that it's still--it's never been easier
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   to meet the basic needs of a person or a family,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   of shelter over their head, of food in their belly,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   than it--it's never been easier than it is today.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And I'm very enthusiastic about some of the advances
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   in being able to shelter and feed people
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   using robotic and AI technology
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   to grow crops locally within the city
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   using very calculated computer-controlled systems
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   or to 3D-print houses for people for $5,000
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   that are safe and comfortable and warm.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So I'm very motivated and optimistic about those trends.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And just the increasing ability for individuals
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   to connect with other individuals.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I do see those things as positive.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   What are you concerned about?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   What trends do you see that keep you up at night?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I'm concerned about tribalism,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   people breaking down into groups.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And one of the things I hate when people say
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   they should do this or they should do that
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   as opposed to we should solve this together.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So the strife, the--just how mad people get.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's not--in politics, for example,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   it's not enough to disagree.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   They hate the other side.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And that terrifies me.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   It really does.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   The lack of ethics, the corporations
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that knowingly pass on costs to innocent,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   negative externalities, and just lie.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I mean, that will destroy a country.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And so on one hand, I go around
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and I think people are basically good,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   but I think people get selfish and they forget.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   They don't think about the consequences
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   of some of their actions sometimes,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   particularly in business.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   So--but I think, generally speaking,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   things are better done on the local level,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and I've talked about that on my show.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   I don't worry about bureaucracy,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   big government, and things of that sort.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   I think there's some things--
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   because the government actually has the power
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   to create money, there's some things better
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   for the government to finance,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   but then have it implemented at the local level.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   If we get to the point where everything's created
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   very easily for what we need,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   but people don't have enough jobs,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   then I think the solution is not to have
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   the federal government hire a bunch of people,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   but finance businesses, give them grants
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   to hire people to go visit the elderly
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   or things like that, but it needs to be done
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   at the local level.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   But those are my concerns.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I think it's just a lack of integrity concerns me,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   the breaking down into tribes,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   income inequality concerns me,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   when businesses, all they care about is profit,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   so they don't pay their workers enough,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and ultimately they--
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and it shouldn't be the government mandates it,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I'm saying as a business we shouldn't be short-sighted,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   we should pay our people fairly.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Now it's hard to figure out, business is hard.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   It concerns me that businesses generally,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   it's easier to buy back stock,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   which is one of the things driving the stock market,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   as opposed to investing in the future
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and investing in their people.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Again, there's always a balance,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   but it's easier to buy back stock as a CEO.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   You get the immediate impact,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   you don't have the uncertainty of other areas.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   I mean those are a few of my concerns,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   but generally I'm optimistic,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and I think these are issues we can solve.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   - I'll give you just a few of mine,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   obviously this is not comprehensive,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   but a few of mine would be,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I agree with you, I concur with you,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   about the lack of ethics.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   We've lost, as the United States of America
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   moves into what seems to be,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   under current understanding,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   what seems to be a post-Christian era,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   we've lost a common ability to talk about ethics,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   where we all affirm the existence of a moral standard,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   but we dissent about what moral standard there is.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And so different people view things differently,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   on discussion of something like minimum wage.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You have two people, one person says,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   you must mandate a minimum wage,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   because that's morally right,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   another person, I would say,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   you must not mandate a minimum wage,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   because that's morally wrong.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Not that you shouldn't pay someone,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   but that's a use of coercion and force.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And so I see this continually,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   as we've lost the ability to discuss things
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   within a frame where we can find common understanding,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   and we lack a common discussion of ethics.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   - And I agree with that.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   - And we don't teach ethics,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   because of this concern,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   we don't teach formally ethics.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   We do in some place.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I went through,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   when I was getting my master's degree in financial planning,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   one of the capstone courses was a discussion of ethics.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And it was drawn from an entirely secular perspective,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   and the philosophy professor who was leading that charge,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I asked her, I said,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   what is the basis for these ethical issues?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And how do you know what is right in the situation?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   What is right in this financial planning situation?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   What is right for this company?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   How do you reason from this?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And since there's no agreement on those first principles,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   the application of it becomes different.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   I'm concerned about the,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I agree with you about tribalism,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   and I see it as so dangerous,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   because especially in the United States of America,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   from my assessment,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   we've lost any kind of,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   we've lost a majority of our common cultural understanding.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I don't feel almost any connection
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   to somebody who is a US American.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Just because somebody's an American,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I don't feel any kind of national pride,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   or national sense of identity with them.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   I feel that sense of connection to people
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   who are outside of that,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   but I often feel more culturally connected
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   to somebody who shares more of my worldview,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   who's of another skin color, from another continent,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   than I do of my neighbor,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   because there doesn't seem to be
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that historical identity that's being passed on.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And I don't know how a nation continues to function
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   if it doesn't have a common heritage,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   a common creed that is passed on
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   from generation to generation.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I've lost that myself.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   I feel very little connection to the neighbor,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   to my neighbors.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   And then increasingly,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   there doesn't seem to be much outworking
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   of that sense of community.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   The communities tend to be siloed,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and not geographic in nature,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   but ideological in nature.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And without belaboring the point,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   it's hard for me to find a whole lot of examples
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   where things are really flourishing,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   where people are really feeling good,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   where people are working towards common progress.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I'm sure they exist,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   just hard for me to find.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   - I think they do.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But I think the key is,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   just go out and meet people.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I mean, I'm sure you do it, right?
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   But meet your neighbors, reach out, be human.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I do think as a nation,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   we have a common set of values,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   freedom, entrepreneurialism, et cetera.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   - I think other nations do too.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   But one of the things that does concern me
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   is where America's the greatest country in the world
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   is what politicians say.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Well, you know, there's a lot of great places.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   And there's a lot of amazingly good people everywhere.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And we just need to be kinder to the people
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   and connect more with people.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And I think that's one thing the internet has done,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   is to allow sort of that common language,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that common connectivity.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And while we might have some of these moral discussions,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   minimum wage, et cetera,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   if we get to the point where we just straight out steal,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   and that becomes accepted, that's the problem.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   - But we already are.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And here's my argument.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   We already are there.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   So half of the population says,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   those other people shouldn't have it,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   so we're gonna take from them to give to these people.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   I call that theft.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Now, it's theft by majority vote, but that is theft.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And so certainly, is it different than me going
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and pilfering the stapler from my boss's office?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   In a sense, but at its fundamental basis,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   it's no different.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   So you talk about this heritage of freedom.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I don't see it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Maybe it's a generational thing,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   but I don't see a lot of people,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I don't hear a lot of people talking about,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I affirm your right to individual freedom.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   It feels to me, speaking very subjectively,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   it feels to me like a lot of people wanna say,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   no, you don't have the freedom to do this.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   No, you don't have the freedom to do that.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You wanna start a business cutting hair?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Yeah, you have to go and apply for a license.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   You wanna go and move into this occupation?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   You need to go and ask for a license.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   It's a constant stricture on freedom,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   so I disagree and dissent.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   We don't have a common heritage of freedom.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   We talk about it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   We talk about defending freedom,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   but I don't see the common heritage.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   - Those are issues on the margin.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   You can still, even if you have to get the license,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   we can talk about the amount of regulation you need
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   to cut people's hair.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   You can't do that in Cuba.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   - You can do it until you get reported
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   and until the government goons start knocking on your door
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and say, are you cutting hair illegally?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I have been in meetings with people.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   One lady, one was a client of mine.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I don't know how she ended up as a client of mine.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   She was cutting hair in her living room in the inner city
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and doing that until she got the knock on the door
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   from the government goons saying,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   we heard that you're doing
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   unauthorized business activities here.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   We're a lot closer to Cuba than we once were.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   That's what I see.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   - We probably are, and that's a different discussion
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   in terms of how much regulation there should be.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   You and I have talked about your inability
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   to have chickens here in Palm Beach County.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   - Right.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   - You've talked about it on your show,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   but yes, but those are issues
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   regarding policy and the limits.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   At the end of the day, though,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   the theft that you discuss,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   again, the government can create the money, right?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   They're not really taking money from you
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   and giving it to somebody else.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   They're taking money from us because we have taxes.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Then the other hand is creating the money to spend,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   and we have to come together
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   in terms of how much should they spend
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   and what they should spend it on
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   and the amount of policy.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Coming full circle, those are issues
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   other than the accounting of what the national debt is.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I think that's sustainable for many years in the future,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   but we take it one year at a time.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   - My closing question for you,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   do you affirm that it's possible
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   that there would be various forms of default,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   bankruptcy, and collapse?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   In coming decades, and if it were possible,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   what would you look for?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   - I would look for just complete lack
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   of honesty with our leaders.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   The government's been taken over by,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   be it the private businesses or whatever,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   and you can tell.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I don't think we're there yet.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   We're still arguing about
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   what the money should be spent on,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   but we are a far cry from,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   I'll give the example of Venezuela,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   where the government is threatening their citizens
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   that you have to vote for me
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   or we will not give you your food stipend
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   because they're starving.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   We're not even close to that yet,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   and for that, I'm fortunate,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   but we could get there,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   and that's why we all have to be involved
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   as citizens in terms of who's elected
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and at the local level, get involved locally,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   and get out and meet our fellow citizens,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   and don't just stay indoors
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   in our gated communities.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   - So I affirm that I could be wrong,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   and I hope that I am.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   We're certainly not in Venezuela,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   but I hope that all of us can work together
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   to avoid that fate.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Thank you for coming on.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   - Hey, it was fun.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   - That was 37 minutes.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   So here's, I'm gonna,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   I turned the recorder back on
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   'cause I just wanna hear this.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   So we got that time pressure off.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   The issue that I face,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and I'm asking this sincerely,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   how old are you now?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   - 53.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   - Okay, so you're about 20 years older than I am,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   and you've been involved in a similar path
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   as I have in terms of the financial world.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   I don't wanna be a catastrophist or an alarmist.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I don't want to scream that the sky is falling
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   when the sky is not falling,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   which is why I'm very sensitive
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   to the people who make foolish decisions
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   and say, well, by 2010,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   the world's gonna collapse,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   and the US dollar's gonna be worth,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   I think those things are so overblown and overstated.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   - 'Cause you're selling a newsletter.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   - Yeah, yeah, the US dollar
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   is the strongest currency in the world,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   but I also don't want to just be a Pollyanna
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   where everything is perfect
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   because I see throughout history
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   a systematic ebb and flow of growth and decline,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   growth and decline.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Empires collapse.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   They do collapse,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   and so just because somebody has said
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   it will collapse and it hasn't yet
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   doesn't mean that it's necessarily not gonna collapse,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and I think back to the question of freedom.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I hear almost nobody advocating for freedom.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I don't hear, and I think political leaders are important
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   'cause they reflect the population
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   to the extent that anybody can reflect the population.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I don't reflect the population.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I'm a voice crying in the wilderness
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   just kind of saying what I think is right,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   but a politician needs to appeal
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   to a larger branch to get elected
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   if a democratic action works as it's supposed to,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   so a politician is gonna reflect the culture.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Tell me who you hear talking about
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   and advocating for freedom
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   as a fundamental principle of US American society.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   - Well, I guess it depends on your definition for freedom.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I think--
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   - You choose the definition.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Just tell me who.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I'm not, sorry, I'm not being snarky with you,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   but I don't care about the definition,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   but what would you define as freedom
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   or any definition you want, I guess.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   - The ability to get up and provide for my family
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and go where I want to go
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and within reason do what I want to do
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   without necessarily impeding or putting harm on others.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   I think we have that,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and so I think it's more a question of degrees.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Maybe we don't have as much freedom as we would like,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and we can argue about laws and regulations, et cetera,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   but as I've traveled around the world,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   we have so much more freedom than,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   we have plenty of freedom.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   And you and I have talked about zoning issues, right?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I mean, governments overstep their bounds
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   because, and I've seen this at the local level, right?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   At the local level,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   it's amazing how much influence you can have at the local level
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   to the extent that they've outlawed chickens
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   in Palm Beach County,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   but they used to outlaw chickens in Rexburg, Idaho.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Well, the citizens came together and said,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   there's a lot more places in the US
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   where you can have chickens in cities now
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   than there were 20 years ago.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   - Right.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   - Because as citizens,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   we decided we want that freedom at our local community
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   to have fresh eggs.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   And so I think, I mean,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   that's an example where freedom's gone the other way,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   despite where we are.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And so I do, I just,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I don't feel constricted day to day
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   in terms of what I can do.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I really don't.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   You start a radical personal finance.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I started money for the rest of us.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Nobody said you couldn't do that.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Many places, they would have.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And so that's a freedom.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   That's a huge freedom we have today
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   that we didn't have 30 years ago.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Everybody can create their own content,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   have their own radio station,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   in terms of a podcast.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   - Right.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   - That's a huge freedom.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   - So I affirm that the United States of America
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   enjoys more of these freedoms
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   than on most places in the world.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   I affirm that.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   As I've traveled, every time I leave the country,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I'm just so thankful for the opportunities.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   I think, and I've said this on the show many times,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   if you, and I probably, it's been a while,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   so I've been outside the border,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   so maybe it's time to take my own advice,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   but if you're feeling downcast
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   about your possibilities that you have in life,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   get on an airplane and go somewhere else,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   and you'll be thankful for your job.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   My wife and I, on our honeymoon,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   we traveled to Haiti,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   and that's just off the shores of Florida.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   I always come back from these places
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   just thankful that I can have a job,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   that I can work, that I can do it,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   because when you're in a world
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   where 75% of people can't even get a job,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   who want a job, it's so broken
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   that you're thankful for the ability
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   to go and get any menial job whatsoever
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   in the United States of America.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   And perhaps I am prone to thinking like an ideologue,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   but I just look at something as simple as work freedom,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   as freedom.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   A majority, seemingly,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   a significant percentage of the population
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   believes that it's...
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I have a number of friends
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   who are immigrants to the United States of America,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and most of them, from different countries,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   a couple of them are out of compliant status
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   with the United States in terms of immigration law.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Several of them are in compliance
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   with the United States in terms of immigration law.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   But I am so frustrated at the idea
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   that the US government thinks
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   that it has the moral authority and right
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   to tell a person,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   "No, you can't work for...
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   "No, you can't go and do honest, productive work
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   "to provide for your family
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   "because you haven't applied for the proper paperwork,"
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   or that the US government would have the temerity
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   to think that it can say to an employer,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   "No, you can't hire this person
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   "because they don't have the appropriate visa requirements
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   "to do honest work that you need them to do."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Now, maybe I'm in a--
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   - Now, what's fascinating about that, right,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   'cause that, I agree with you,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   and that, which is why this is a great conversation,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   that's not a conservative position.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   - No, no, and this is my frustration with,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   this is what I am fed up with,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   with the political world,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   because it's like every about 50 years,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   the Democrats and the Republicans basically swap places
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   and take each other's positions,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   about every 50 years,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and that's what frustrates me,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   because I've not heard of a Republican position,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   I've not heard of a Republican,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   maybe there are,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   I don't hear a Republican politician
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   affirming somebody's right to work.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Now, flip it around, let's just pick on the Democrats,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   so we pick on everybody and annoy every listener.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   On the same hand,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   there are lots of Democrats and Democratic politicians
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   who say, "You should be able to hire somebody
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   "regardless of their immigration status,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   "but we're going to require you, at the threat of force,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   "to pay them $15 an hour,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   "whether the work that they're doing for you
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   "is worth $15 an hour or not."
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And so I deny both of those premises.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I affirm the fact that any person
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   should be able to make any other private contract
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   with any other person,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   as long as the work is moral and ethical and legal,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   as long as those things are there,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   without interference, that's freedom.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   But I don't hear anybody affirming that.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And so when you talk about freedom,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   yes, we do have freedom,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   but I look at it and say,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   is this not an inheritance from centuries of work
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   that are unique to the US-American experiment?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Because the early colonists of the United States
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   were desperately longing for freedom.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   They were seeking religious freedom.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And now I find myself, as a religious minority,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   with much of my religious freedom diminished,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   and what religious freedom I do enjoy
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   banished to the idea of private practice
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   as long as it's not public
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   or as long as it has no effect on your actual life.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   And so I look at that and say,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   the heritage was freedom,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   but where is the continuing press towards freedom?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   I don't see it.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   All I see is a continual stricture.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Now, compared to the rest of the world,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   absolutely, it's there,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   but I don't see that change.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   - No, no, no, and I agree with that.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   I think religious freedom,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   there's less of it than it was.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   And I don't know.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And so I use this as evidence for my position
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   that this common,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   I don't think we don't speak a common understanding.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   I don't hear those common ideas
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   reflected in US-American culture.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   I hear the platitudes of,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   we live for freedom, fight for freedom, et cetera.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   We all inherit the freedom that people have died for.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I hear the platitudes,
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   but I don't see much of the results.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Much of the freedom seems to me to be
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   enlarged by individuals,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   but largely by individuals with technological changes.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   There are tremendous freedoms.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   That's why I stated those things,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   like the destruction of the monopoly on the press.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I love that.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I'm thrilled with it.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Now, it's very uncomfortable, right?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   You gotta deal with fake news and all this stuff,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   but it is a good thing for freedom.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   And I'm the inheritor, for example, home education.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Just simple things.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   I was born at home when I was born
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   in a time when home birth
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   was not particularly officially sanctioned.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   I was homeschooled at a time
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   when home education was not officially sanctioned.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   It was very much a gray area.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Whereas today, it's relatively easy
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   for anybody who wants to take control of those things to do it.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   But I don't hear that common conversation.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   So, I'm ranting and raving,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   and I don't know what my point is,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   so I'll let you say something smart.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   - Well, I'll just wrap up.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Get on the road like you plan on doing,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   and travel around, and come to Idaho.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   There's a lot of freedom out in Idaho.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   - Indeed. Thanks, David.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   You've honored me with your time and attention,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   and techniques and tools
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   in today's show, make a plan to take action on it.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   Listening does lead to learning,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   but learning in and of itself
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   So, take action.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Two, take something that was helpful to you
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   in today's show and share it
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   with somebody that you care about.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   in helping me to propagate the message
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   That helps the person that you are engaging with,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   and it also helps you because teaching others
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   is one of the most effective ways for you to learn
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   and for you to cement your learning.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Three, if there's an idea that's been
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   specifically helpful to you
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   and if you're gaining financial benefit
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   from Radical Personal Finance,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   for this work voluntarily.

[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   That's my Patreon page.

[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   any number that seems right to you.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   and if it's achieving financial results in your life,
