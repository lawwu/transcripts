[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:43.280]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I have a special treat for you. A joint show with my friend David Stein, who is the host of the excellent personal finance and investing podcast called Money for the Rest of Us.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:56.920]   Back in episode 466 in June of 2017, I recorded an episode called The USA's Long-Term Fiscal Gap and Why It Matters to You.

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.660]   I read an essay by Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.660]   I believe I read his testimony that he presented to the U.S. Congress on the subject of what is referred to as the unfunded liabilities of the U.S. government. Unfunded liabilities are those promises that have been made to citizens of promises of benefits, but promises that have not been paid for nor has money been allocated to citizens.

He lays out a very strong case that in the 2008 financial collapse that the government was getting involved, but that moral connection was broken. And he makes a very strong case that all of the governmental intervention was unnecessary. Now, I also read the official U.S. report that was issued by the inquiry into the financial collapse. And of course, they would disagree with one another. So the moral dimension is one thing, but let's stick with the financial. I don't think the government should have anything to do.

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:20.660]   I would say yes in this way that a significant portion of the federal expenditure, I don't have the number in front of me, but I would say what? 15, 20% of the federal expenditure is currently spent on interest. No, it would be less than that. Interest on the federal debt, right? And that debt has accumulated since World War II. So we are still currently paying interest. But nobody's collected it.

[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But I don't think they're out of control.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.540]   In other words, we could run a three to 4%
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.160]   deficit to GDP indefinitely.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.420]   We've done it.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.980]   And it's just, it's been done.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.900]   And it goes back to showing
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.420]   when is the collapse gonna occur
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.360]   from a fiscal standpoint?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.720]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:36.820]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:36.880]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:36.980]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.080]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.140]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.240]   Japan has twice as much debt to GDP
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:53.800]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.740]   So 240% debt to GDP.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.620]   We're about 103%.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.720]   And Japan is doing just fine and doesn't have issues
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   with inflation because their population is shrinking.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   And so again, the constraint is,
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   is there enough people to produce the goods and services.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   And it'll be interesting to see
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.520]   because Japan will get into trouble
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.720]   way, way sooner than the US.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   If there is a constraint,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.720]   Japan is gonna get in trouble.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   And so we're not gonna do anything.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.240]  .
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.260]  .
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.960]   Japan is gonna get in trouble.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   Japan is gonna get in trouble.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.260]   But right now, it's just not there.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   But right now, it's just not there.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   But right now, it's just not there.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260]   Okay, so here's the point though.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:12.300]   Okay, so here's the point though.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.060]   Okay, so here's the point though. The numbers that you're
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.120]   The numbers that you're
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.700]   The numbers that you're referencing are
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:15.780]   referencing are
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.480]   referencing are on-book liabilities.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:17.540]   on-book liabilities.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.220]   on-book liabilities. The official federal debt
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:20.300]   The official federal debt
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   The official federal debt as is calculated,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:21.380]   as is calculated,
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.180]   as is calculated, which is what, 20 trillion?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.340]   which is what, 20 trillion?
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:23.940]   which is what, 20 trillion? Yeah, 20 trillion.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.020]   Yeah, 20 trillion.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:42.640]   Yeah, 20 trillion. Whereas what Kotlikoff's
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:42.700]   Whereas what Kotlikoff's
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.680]   Whereas what Kotlikoff's point is, is the unfunded
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:44.740]   point is, is the unfunded
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.820]   point is, is the unfunded liabilities, which in his
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:45.860]   liabilities, which in his
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.940]   liabilities, which in his estimation, depending on the
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.020]   estimation, depending on the
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.820]   estimation, depending on the year of his work, range anywhere
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:48.900]   year of his work, range anywhere
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.820]   year of his work, range anywhere from 180 to 200 trillion
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:50.860]   from 180 to 200 trillion
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.820]   from 180 to 200 trillion dollars. And so here's where,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.820]   dollars. And so here's where, in my
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.020]   And so here's where, in my guess, after I've spent about a decade
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.700]   guess, after I've spent about a decade kind of thinking about this, and a
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:57.760]   kind of thinking about this, and a
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.300]   kind of thinking about this, and a decade ago when I started to think about
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:16:59.340]   decade ago when I started to think about
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.560]   decade ago when I started to think about it, I said, I had this impression
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:01.640]   it, I said, I had this impression
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.440]   it, I said, I had this impression that, well, one day the federal
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:03.500]   that, well, one day the federal
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   that, well, one day the federal government is going to run out of
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.540]   government is going to run out of
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.300]   government is going to run out of money and they're not going to...
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:06.380]   money and they're not going to...
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.040]   money and they're not going to... That's not possible unless you
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.100]   That's not possible unless you
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.240]   That's not possible unless you have a society in anarchy, because
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:28.520]   have a society in anarchy, because
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.560]   have a society in anarchy, because the power behind the U.S. dollar
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:30.640]   the power behind the U.S. dollar
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.240]   the power behind the U.S. dollar as a made-up currency without
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.300]   as a made-up currency without
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.500]   as a made-up currency without any fundamental connection to
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:33.560]   any fundamental connection to
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.440]   any fundamental connection to anything constraining, the power is
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.500]   anything constraining, the power is
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.980]   anything constraining, the power is the taxing authority of the entity
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.040]   the taxing authority of the entity
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   the taxing authority of the entity and of the state behind it, and
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.080]   and of the state behind it, and of the state behind it, and
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.240]   and of the state behind it, and of the state's ability to use force to
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   and of the state's ability to use force to enforce their taxation.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   and of the state's ability to enforce their taxation.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.280]   And the problem is, what are those checks worth when
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.340]   And the problem is, what are those checks worth when
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.780]   And the problem is, what are those checks worth when they actually get there?
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:44.840]   they actually get there?
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.080]   they actually get there? And so I don't see any way that all
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.120]   And so I don't see any way that all
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.860]   And so I don't see any way that all of a sudden that all of the hoopla
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:51.920]   of a sudden that all of the hoopla
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.620]   of a sudden that all of the hoopla over government shutdowns notwithstanding,
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:54.700]   over government shutdowns notwithstanding,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.920]   over government shutdowns notwithstanding, which is just, in my mind,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.000]   which is just, in my mind,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.840]   which is just, in my mind, political theater.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:58.900]   political theater.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.540]   political theater. I don't think that at some point in
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:00.600]   I don't think that at some point in
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:23.900]   I don't think that at some point in time you just stop, that the
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:23.960]   time you just stop, that the
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.340]   time you just stop, that the U.S. government stops writing
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.400]   U.S. government stops writing
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.700]   U.S. government stops writing checks.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.760]   checks.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.600]   checks. But I do think that the value of
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.660]   But I do think that the value of
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.600]   But I do think that the value of what is promised continually
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   what is promised continually
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:30.640]   But I do think that the value of what is promised continually constricts.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   And it goes back to the world of financial planning.

So they had their wealth, which is their actual investments, but they had their financial statements. And I remember one year, the CFO came to me and said, we don't have enough gains because my financial statement shows we're losing money. Yet their portfolio was up that year.

We're a lot closer to Cuba than we once were.

[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.060]   Many places they would have.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:13.060]   And so that's a freedom. That's a huge freedom we have today that we didn't have 30 years ago.
