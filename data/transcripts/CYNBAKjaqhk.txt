[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Welcome back everyone.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.800]   This is a special episode of the podcast based on what's happening in the world right now.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.760]   We don't plan to have a lot of coronavirus episodes, but the virus raises a few topics
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.440]   that we need to address on the podcast, and that includes the topic of loneliness, which
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.880]   is what we talk about today.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   This season of self-quarantine is abnormal for most of us, and that means the feeling
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.560]   of loneliness is a reality most of us now face.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.080]   We can't visit retirement homes, closed off to us now are churches, workplaces, restaurants.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.560]   The sense of isolation and loneliness so common before this virus has been amplified now by
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   this quarantine.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.800]   No surprise we're hearing this theme in our inboxes, listeners write in.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.320]   So Pastor John, what would you say to the lonely during this season?
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.960]   That's a good word you just said, amplification.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   Things are amplified now that in a sense have always been true for some.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.320]   So maybe the first thing to say is that I'm aware that thousands of Christians live alone
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.760]   all the time and deal with the issue of aloneness and sometimes loneliness, even when there
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.320]   is no coronavirus to amplify the issue.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   A few of these people love it that way.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.600]   Most of them, most of them probably can imagine situations they'd rather be in, whether marriage
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.500]   or friendships or memberships that just haven't come their way.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.880]   So we're not talking about an issue here that is only relevant during coronavirus, but there
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.520]   is no doubt that millions of people are being thrown now into a kind of life that they have
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.480]   never lived before, at least not in this way.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.960]   These really are unprecedented days, and we don't know how long they're going to go, and
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.720]   we don't know how bad things are going to get or not.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:21.900]   So it's good to say in general for the long-term issue of aloneness or loneliness or the short-term
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.960]   issue of loneliness during this crisis that it's okay to believe and to feel that loneliness
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.840]   or aloneness is not the ideal way of life that God set up for humanity at the beginning.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.360]   It's okay to believe that.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.960]   He said to Adam when he was alone in Genesis 2:18, "It's not good for man to be alone,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.340]   but the world isn't the way it was created to be."
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.680]   And there are many reasons, some good, some justifiable, some bad, for why people are
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.840]   alone.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.040]   Paul wasn't married.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.880]   Jesus wasn't married.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.760]   They knew lots of aloneness.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.360]   Thousands of missionaries have had fruitful ministries without marriage partners, which
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.400]   means that even though aloneness is not ideal, God has provided grace for all kinds of situations
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.280]   in this fallen world that are not ideal, and loneliness is one of them.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.480]   He's not unaware of it.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.500]   Jesus experienced it, and there is grace for it, whether the short-term of coronavirus
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.100]   loneliness, or the long-term of a life situation that involves loneliness.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.920]   One way that God planned grace for the lonely is by sending his Son to become a human being
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.960]   so that Jesus, his Son, could experience a kind of loneliness that would make him, the
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.820]   Bible says, a sympathetic high priest for the lonely.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.140]   I think the Gethsemane scene, the night before he died, is one of the most poignant in the
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.140]   Bible.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.660]   Jesus takes his closest friends, Peter, James, and John, apart, and he says, "My soul is
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.460]   very sorrowful, even to death.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.140]   Remain here and watch with me."
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.540]   And going a little farther, that means he's now alone, "He fell on his face and prayed,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.260]   'Father, my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.580]   Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.'
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.540]   And he came to his disciples, and he found them sleeping.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.300]   And he said to Peter, 'So you could not watch with me one hour?'"
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.340]   Now, that happened three times.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.340]   They fell asleep on him.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.380]   He wanted their partnership in prayer in this hour.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.220]   He was a human being, and they couldn't do it.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.860]   So it gets worse.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.780]   When the soldiers come, it says, "Then they all forsook him and fled."
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.540]   And it gets worse yet, because the next morning it says, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.540]   me?"
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.740]   Now, why so much loneliness in his suffering?
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.580]   Because it was all according to Scripture.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.580]   This was planned.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.580]   Why?
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.580]   Well, among other reasons, it was so that Hebrews 4, 15, and 16 could be in the Bible
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.020]   for lonely people.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.220]   "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.540]   who was tested or tempted"—same word in Greek—"tested in every way like we are, with loneliness,
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.420]   yet without sin."
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.740]   And then it says, "Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.560]   may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of," it says, "need," but you could
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.440]   just supply, "loneliness."
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.900]   So Christ experienced utter forsakenness, utter loneliness, so that we would boldly
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.040]   pray for grace, a special grace in time of loneliness, and would have confidence he would
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   give it.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.380]   Now, what might a prayer like that sound like?
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.980]   Well, here's what it sounded like in the mouth of David.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:28.220]   Psalm 25, 16, "Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted."
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.500]   He had a lot of crises where he was cut off from the people he needed.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.060]   This is a good prayer right now for thousands of people.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.220]   I'm saying this is a good prayer right now for thousands of people.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.300]   "Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted."
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.500]   Will God answer that prayer?
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.740]   Well, there are good reasons to believe that he will.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.020]   First, because he made provisions for it while he was still here.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.740]   He said, "I will not leave you orphans."
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.220]   I won't leave you as orphans.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.300]   "I will come to you," John 14, 18.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.740]   The last thing he said on earth was, "Behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.340]   In other words, he sends the Holy Spirit, which is the Spirit of Christ, and he will
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.940]   be with every Christian.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.700]   Christian, you are not alone.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   I'll say it again.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.500]   Christian, you are not alone.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.100]   This is absolutely wonderful.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.520]   You are never alone.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.460]   The most important person in the universe—mark it—the most important person in the universe
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.260]   is with you personally.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.420]   He promised to be.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.820]   He doesn't break his word.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.020]   He is.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.100]   And the second reason we can expect a sweet answer to that prayer is, "Fear not, for
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   I am with you."
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   There it is.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.260]   You don't need to go any farther in Isaiah 41.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.940]   I mean, we all want to go farther.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.180]   "Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.180]   Be not dismayed.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.180]   I am your God.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.180]   I'll strengthen you.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.180]   I'll help you.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.420]   I'll hold you up with my righteous right hand."
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.020]   But the first phrase is everything.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.980]   "Fear not, I am with you."
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.860]   Or here's the way Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "God is able to make all grace abound
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.540]   to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   every good work."
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:21.320]   In other words, there is a grace, a well-timed grace to make you fruitful in times of loneliness.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.820]   So the experience of loneliness is real for God's people, God's people, because this
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.740]   world is not what it was created to be yet.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.780]   In its ideal form, when it was made, it fell.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.600]   It is a fallen world, and our relationships are fallen and viruses are fallen.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:52.740]   But God did not leave the world and its brokenness without grace, special grace for every need
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.940]   that His people have, including the need of loneliness.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:02.780]   Jesus purchased that grace for sinners with His own lonely suffering.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.260]   He knows our frame.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:10.580]   He has tasted it, worse than we know, and He will not leave us as orphans.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.500]   He will come to us.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:19.420]   Whether the coronavirus isolates us or takes our life, He will not leave us alone.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.180]   This is a precious and sure promise.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.180]   Amen.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.180]   Amen.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.180]   Amen.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.300]   Those are really good words here, refocusing our attention on Christ and to His vicarious
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.700]   loneliness that He endured on our behalf.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.820]   Thank you for that potent perspective, Pastor John.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.820]   Well, here at DG, once a week or so, we're producing special resources related to this
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.840]   pandemic, including this and other APJ episodes and a few articles.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.340]   You can find all of them online at DesiringGod.org/coronavirus, that's DesiringGod.org/coronavirus.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.060]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke.
