[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.800]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.680]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400]   Now, just a few weeks ago, I read a few posts
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800]   that really had me thinking more
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   about how I wanna optimize 2023.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.240]   One was about conducting a personal annual review,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.200]   and the other was about 23 ways
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   to make 2023 an amazing year.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.160]   They were both fantastic,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.760]   and they were both written by my friend Sahil Bloom,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.940]   who is one of my favorite creators.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.360]   But he actually started his career in private equity
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.120]   and then spent a decade investing professionally
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.160]   before he turned to writing about finance
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.520]   and sharing his frameworks
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.440]   to have a more fulfilling life and career.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.040]   And to prepare for this conversation,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.180]   I actually ended up coming up
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600]   with so many topics I wanted to cover,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520]   but we're gonna have to get to them another time
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.880]   because we're gonna focus today
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.140]   on conducting a personal annual review,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.280]   which is nothing like the arduous process
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.840]   of a performance review at work.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.760]   It's actually just seven questions you can ask yourself
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.440]   that give you the perfect opportunity
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   to reflect on the past year and plan for what's ahead.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   Then we're gonna walk through some of Sahil
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.720]   and my top recommendations
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.400]   for how to make 2023 an amazing year
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.820]   across your work, health, life, and money.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560]   I'm so excited for this conversation,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.860]   so let's get started right after this.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.640]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.960]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.120]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580]   but one of his top hacks
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.060]   was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.500]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.220]   but after getting a full set
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.400]   of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.140]   I am a total convert and I am so excited
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.400]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.440]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.680]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.040]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.080]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.680]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.200]   all in the same dish
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.040]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.640]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.840]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.120]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.520]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.680]   - Zile, welcome to the show.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.960]   - Thank you for having me, man.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.000]   As an avid listener,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.600]   I'm excited to make my debut appearance here.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.200]   - Yeah, and we'll probably get to this at the end,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.280]   but there might be some future appearances coming.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   But it's January, there are a lot of people out there
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.660]   trying to make their resolutions,
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.600]   make their intentions for the year.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.800]   What do you think people get wrong
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.880]   when they go through that process?
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.640]   - The biggest thing I think people get wrong
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000]   is focus on the planning side
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.680]   and not enough on the reflecting side.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.200]   There's this quote that I love,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   John Dewey, an American philosopher.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.680]   And basically what he said was,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.400]   "We don't learn from experience,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.960]   "we learn from reflecting on experience."
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.720]   And I always thought that was a really powerful way
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.880]   of thinking about your year.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280]   Like you get to the end of the year
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.560]   and everyone's instinct is,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.600]   okay, I'm gonna look forward, let me make my goals,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.440]   let me do all that.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   And that's just like the way everyone operates.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   It's the standard.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   And not enough time is spent reflecting
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.640]   on the year that just passed.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   And what did you learn from it
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   and how can you actually take those learnings
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   and drive yourself forward
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.600]   and do a better year going forward?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.760]   - It's funny, I was hoping you'd say that
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.400]   because I wanted to talk about your personal annual review
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.360]   because I've seen you tweet about it
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.160]   and then you actually produced this document
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.520]   that people could download.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.800]   I kinda wanna walk through it.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280]   So do you think we could just give people an overview
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.000]   of how you structure an annual review?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880]   And then if anyone listening wants a copy,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.080]   we'll definitely link to it in the show notes.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.360]   - Yeah, it's a pretty simple structure as you know there.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.240]   I've been doing this for the last five plus years,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.960]   I would say in this format.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   And you've had or had discussions
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.560]   with a few of these people,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   but I've taken inspiration over the years
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.640]   from a lot of the giants that I really look up to
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.880]   and admire like Tim Ferriss or James Clear
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.640]   who have written about in the past
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.400]   their annual review structures.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.960]   And so I've sort of adapted that,
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   but basically the whole thing
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.600]   is framed around seven questions.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.680]   So maybe we can just go through the questions,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.440]   you and I can chat about them a little bit.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.720]   I'm curious for what your perspectives are
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.240]   on your own year on these.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.360]   Maybe we can go from there.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.680]   - I'm so glad you put this together
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.080]   and that we're having this conversation
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.760]   'cause I went through and I started going through
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   all of this myself.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.160]   And I don't think I would have done that
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   without your prompt.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   It's like you jump in and you're like,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.080]   "Oh, I got all this stuff to do this year."
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.040]   So I think this was a great process for me.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.960]   I hope other people take that away from it.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.200]   But let's just jump in, number one.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.160]   - So the first one that I always start with
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.440]   is what did I change my mind on this year?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's the first question I always ask.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.280]   And the genesis of this is really just this idea
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.200]   that if you're not changing in any way, you're dying.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.360]   Like we need to adapt.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.640]   We need to have those like software updates
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.200]   as I like to think of them to our mind
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   to rewrite the old code and refresh it with new things.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.160]   And so at the end of the year, I always like to ask,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.200]   like what are the big things
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.240]   that I really changed my mind on?
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.720]   And if there's nothing, I start to get really worried.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.400]   That's when the tension starts to build.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   So that's always the first question that I ask.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   - I'm curious for you specifically,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.680]   what are some of the things
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.240]   that you feel like you changed your mind on this year?
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   And I'm happy to give you mine.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   - So I'll run through it, but I have one quick question,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.600]   which is for each of these things,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.000]   is there anything you do that helps jog your memory?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   For me, I was like looking through my photo albums,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   like where was I this year
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.440]   to try to just anchor some points on things?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.120]   Or I was looking at my work calendar,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.840]   like I was trying to figure out,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.280]   it's not that I didn't change my mind.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.200]   It's like, how do I find the things I changed on
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   without too much recency bias on like,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   what did I change my mind on in December?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.120]   - Part of the value of this whole process
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   is that it requires you to pause
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.800]   and actually look back at your work, writing, projects,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.040]   things that you did during the course of the year,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.560]   because that actually gives you the zoomed out perspective.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.640]   The whole value of doing an annual review like this
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.320]   is really that you're constantly living
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.800]   in a first person view.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.520]   You're zoomed in as far as you can possibly be.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   And this forces you to zoom out.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.480]   You're like a bird flying to 10,000 feet
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.760]   and now observing your full year and being able to do it.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.920]   So for me, I'm a writer.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.400]   That's kind of my primary thing.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760]   So I can actually go back and look at all of my writing
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.320]   during the course of the year and see, find those trends,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.520]   look at things that I was talking about, thinking about,
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   and how those might've morphed or changed.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.480]   For a lot of people, it can be journaling,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   notes that you've left yourself
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   during the course of the year.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.740]   Some people send themselves emails.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.680]   I like doing that a lot from time to time, note documents.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.880]   Sometimes it's just conversations with friends.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.560]   It's also a reason, by the way,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.880]   why these annual reviews are often really productive
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.040]   to do in a group setting or in a one-on-one setting
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.900]   with another individual that you trust,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.080]   because it tends to lead to a slightly more active discussion
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   and pushbacks that actually make you think
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   a little bit more deeply
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.620]   and avoid that recency bias that you mentioned.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.160]   For me, for some reason,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.920]   and maybe it's that I live in the Bay Area
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   and there's no seasons.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.160]   So I don't have this, like,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.500]   what was happening when it was snowing?
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.680]   What was happening during summer?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.840]   I like to use the calendar and go back
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.400]   and look at calendars and photos to just jog my memory.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.920]   Like, what happened in spring?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.040]   Oh, I went on this trip to New York or Boston or something.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.280]   Oh, what was going on at work around the time I did that?
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.320]   So that was my version.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   I've done that recently, by the way, with my wife.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.840]   So we just had our sixth anniversary and we were on a walk
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.120]   and we started thinking about,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.800]   okay, what did we do each year since we got married?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.440]   Like, what were the big milestones, trips, things we did?
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.820]   And it was such a fun and interesting exercise
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.880]   to think about, like,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.440]   what our mindset was at each of these points in life.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.800]   We got married and then we kind of had,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   you have the honeymoon period
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.920]   and you're going on all these trips
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.560]   and what were you thinking about and doing?
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.600]   It's actually a really fun relationship exercise
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.480]   for people that have been in longer term relationships.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.320]   - I'll share one thing
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.640]   and then I'll promise I'll answer your question,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.880]   which is starting in, I don't know why, March of 2014,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.680]   I started logging this doc,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.840]   it's just a Google sheet called monthly experiences.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.000]   And my goal was that every month for the rest of my life,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.040]   I needed to have an experience
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   that made that month memorable.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.640]   I first was like, was it monthly memorables?
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.840]   Was monthly experiences?
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.120]   And it didn't necessarily have to be
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   some crazy skydiving kind of thing.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   One of them was like, I had surgery on my foot
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.000]   because I had this thing called a Morton's neuroma
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.040]   and it had been a pain in my life for a long time.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.760]   And finally, I was just like, I'm gonna do this.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.360]   One was, we were in Colorado where my wife grew up
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.320]   and it was like so much snow, it was so cold.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.920]   And I was like, I'm gonna go build an igloo.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.320]   Like get a chainsaw, cut blocks of ice and build an igloo.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.360]   Things like that.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.800]   June, 2015, we got a dog.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.640]   This was one way,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.560]   it has nothing to do with an annual review,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   but it was, I wanted to make sure
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.200]   that every month of my life, there was something memorable.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.040]   And I was like, gosh, it really dropped off a cliff
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.360]   when I had kids and the pandemic hit
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   and I need to resume it.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.080]   But it was like, oh, when the pandemic was here
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.720]   and you have kids, yeah, there was something memorable
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.240]   with childhood development each month,
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.480]   but it felt weird to be like, kid smiled, kid said dad.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.440]   Like it was so focused on that.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.100]   So I got to get it back going,
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.520]   but something to encourage everyone to consider
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.120]   if you're wanting to make sure each month
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   has something exciting and memorable.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.080]   I love that idea.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.900]   It's great.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.360]   So a few of the things for me was that,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.840]   one was around outsourcing.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.040]   I think I have always been someone,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.640]   in multiple jobs, I've had the opportunity to have an admin
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.480]   and I just always said no, I always said no.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.840]   I was kind of taking everything into my own hands.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.080]   I loved optimizing.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.040]   And finally, last year in 2022, I really started saying,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.080]   okay, maybe I could hire someone to help do some research.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.320]   Maybe I could hire someone to help
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.600]   with parts of the newsletter, with parts of the editing,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.520]   with parts of the production.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.160]   So last year was a year that I changed my mind
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.520]   on hiring people to help do things,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   to give you more surface area you can cover
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   with your own time.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.000]   So that was one.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.120]   That's a powerful one.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.920]   That's gonna pay dividends for a long time,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.120]   changing your mind on that.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.820]   Yeah, the other one, which I think was the hardest,
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.640]   was learning to spend money.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.180]   And I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like myself,
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.300]   and maybe a lot of people listening,
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.760]   we almost get to the point of optimizing and frugality,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.000]   that it's very hard to spend money on anything.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.320]   Like, I remember we're at a Japanese restaurant
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   and I was like, all I want is a miso soup.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   Like, that just felt like what I wanted today.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.880]   And I was like, "God, they're charging $7 for a miso soup.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.240]   I feel like a miso soup should be $3 or $4."
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.360]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.160]   I just need to stop worrying."
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.280]   Like, I'm so used to telling people,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.520]   "Stop worrying about the latte.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.560]   It's not about the latte.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   This is a Ramit Sethi thing."
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.040]   He's like, "The lattes aren't what's killing you.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.160]   It's these big decisions."
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   And here I am, to use the Japanese restaurant example,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   not ordering a seaweed salad because I like it,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.920]   because it's an extra $5, or not getting miso soup
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.080]   because it's overpriced by $2.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.400]   I found that when you can just like,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.200]   let the small decisions go,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.360]   happiness goes up, stress goes down, anxiety goes down.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.280]   When it comes to optimizing my finances,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.760]   where I am in my life, those like,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.160]   one, two, three, four, $5 differences
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.400]   weren't having a big impact.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.240]   And so, I've changed my mind on that a lot.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.280]   When I'm shopping online for groceries,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.800]   I would like pull up Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.960]   and like, price compare strawberries and stuff like that.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.120]   I've kind of gotten over the small costs of things
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.960]   and gotten comfortable.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   So those are two things.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.000]   And the one small funny thing that I'll share,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.120]   which I put in my end of the year learnings, was mouth tape.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.920]   When I interviewed Liz Moody,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.240]   who has this Healthier Together podcast,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.760]   she was like, "You should consider trying this out,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   "taping your mouth at night."
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.640]   And I was like, "That is the craziest thing."
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.640]   For six months, I was like, "That's the craziest thing."
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.480]   And then I was like, "You know what?
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.560]   "I'm just gonna try it."
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.600]   And it was awesome.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   - Changed your life?
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.320]   Were you a big mouth breather before?
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.880]   - It wasn't a thing that I processed in my mind,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.080]   but there were just times where I woke up
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.480]   and my mouth was a little dry,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.040]   and I was like, "Oh, I wonder if I'm a really
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.280]   "heavy mouth breather now."
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.440]   And then I tried it, and I was like,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.160]   "I woke up, and it just felt like my mouth was fresh."
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.280]   I know it sounds like a weird thing to say.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.520]   - Well, it's deeply impactful for your health.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.560]   Breathing through your nose.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.480]   You should have James Nester on at some point.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.760]   He wrote the Bible on this.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.880]   - Yeah, breathe.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.200]   We've been going back and forth.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.000]   - You should have him on and do an episode on breathing,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.680]   'cause it's hugely impactful for your health.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.880]   - So that was one where you write it off as like,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.720]   "That's so silly.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   "Why would you do that?
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.400]   "That seems ridiculous."
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.000]   And last year I was like, "You know what?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.840]   "Let's just try it."
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   And now I have a stack of hostage tape,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.240]   which is the most ridiculous name
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.080]   for a mouth tape company on my bedside.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.480]   - There is a general rule of thumb there, by the way.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.560]   And maybe it's like a David Foster Wallace,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.800]   this is water, take away as well,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   of any time your bias is, "That's totally ridiculous.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.940]   "That sounds silly.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.140]   "That's wild."
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.160]   Just try it.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.240]   Because half the time, those things
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.520]   that you're automatically highly certain of,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.680]   you end up being completely wrong on.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.480]   And maybe we would all learn a whole lot more
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   about ourselves and grow in a different way
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   if we just took on those things
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.680]   that we write off immediately.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.360]   - Anything from your list this past year
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.200]   that's worth sharing?
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   - The biggest one for me was a kid thing.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.520]   I think you know this, but we had our first son in May.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.560]   He was born.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   And I had these like grand ambition prior to him being born
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   of all the things I was gonna teach him.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.800]   Like I had this long list that I had written out
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.000]   of all the stuff I was gonna teach my son
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and how I was gonna mold his personality
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.280]   in all these different ways.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   And I think somewhere around like the six month mark,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.160]   which was later in the year,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.360]   I just realized that I don't think it's possible.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.160]   I basically think that kids come out with a sort of a kit
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.280]   and their personality and who they are
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   and aspects of their character.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   It's sort of fixed.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.600]   It's like genetic.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.560]   They come out with it.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.800]   And our job is actually not to try to teach them things
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.440]   around all of these specific values that we want.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.760]   It's to be able to embody our values as a person
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   and hopefully guide them in the general direction
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.000]   of what we believe is a strong set of values.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.560]   But the idea of like being able to mold and shape my child,
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.960]   I've given up on as something that's possible.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.200]   It's funny 'cause just this morning,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.040]   I had a moment that further emphasized this for me,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.640]   which was there were these three little felt balls
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   and my daughter was playing with them.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.240]   And she's like, "Daddy, here you go."
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.280]   And she just hands them to me.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.520]   And I start juggling them and she's like mesmerized.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   She's two and a half.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.560]   She's obviously too young to learn to juggle right now.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.360]   I'm sure there's some savant kid in the world
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.480]   who could juggle a two and a half,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.880]   but that didn't seem possible today.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.840]   A Rubik's cube probably solving it.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.560]   But I was thinking, gosh, I bet if I went to her
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.520]   and was like, "Hey, let me teach you how to juggle."
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.720]   She'd be like, "No, I wanna do things on my own."
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.560]   But just doing it.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.600]   Like if you want your child to maybe do something
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.120]   that you do or learn something,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   letting them emulate you and watch you
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.440]   and maybe admire and look up to it
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.240]   is probably gonna be a 10 times more effective way to do it
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.160]   than trying to force them to learn this thing
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.440]   that you want them to learn.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.320]   - Completely agree.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.400]   That's why I bring my son with me in my garage gym
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   so that he can watch me work out.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   - He's like seven months old.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.240]   He's like sitting over there, he's like,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.360]   "I'm gonna do that one day."
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.200]   Awesome.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.760]   Okay, question two.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.600]   - Let's do it.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.880]   - All right, so the second question and the third
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   are all around energy.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.640]   And the second question is basically
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.000]   what created energy for you during the course of the year?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   This whole idea is to go back and look at your calendars.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.400]   You said you were already doing this for the first one,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.880]   but go back and look at your calendars from the year
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.480]   and try to identify the trends
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.680]   in what actually created energy in your life.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   What were the activities?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.640]   What were the work projects?
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.600]   What were the meetings?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.920]   Who were the people?
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.840]   What were these trends that actually brought you energy?
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.680]   - So this was a fun one.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   I guess people listening to this
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.600]   are probably not gonna pause and go do one
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.800]   before finishing the episode,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   so they won't have this problem.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.880]   But I would definitely encourage people to listen
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.600]   or read all of the topics of the personal review
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.440]   and then go back and look at your calendar.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.760]   Otherwise, you'd go back,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.200]   learn a bunch of things you changed your mind on
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.400]   and then have to repeat the process.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.560]   So this was really interesting
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.240]   because I think this past year was the first year
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.680]   that the world opened up and I was a creator
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.560]   and I met a bunch of other people,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.160]   creating podcasts, YouTube, all kinds of stuff.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.040]   That's just never been a part of my career.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.000]   I met a lot of founders and investors
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.080]   and people in finance and financial advisors and planners,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.520]   but I'd never really met a lot of creators.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.600]   And that was one thing that gave me a lot of energy
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.040]   because this is my new job
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.560]   and I've just have never been in this industry.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.520]   So that was a big one for me.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.880]   And then going on adventures with my daughter,
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.480]   just me and her, and we have two now,
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.840]   but we would ride our bike.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.400]   I'd put her on the back, we'd ride the bike,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.200]   we'd hop on Caltrain, we'd ride like two stops on Caltrain,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.400]   we'd get off, we'd go to the donut shop,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.080]   we'd like buy a donut and then we'd like bike back home.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.920]   It's so awesome.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.040]   It's like those adventures were so much fun.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.360]   I have a bunch of other ones, but those are two I'll share.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.320]   And then the question to ask yourself, by the way,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.200]   after you identify those activities, those people,
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.600]   the projects, is really, did I spend enough time on those?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   Go look at it.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.200]   Was that like 2% of my time spent?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.120]   And I was actually just spending the rest of my time
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.960]   on other stuff?
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   Because that's a question that you then need to answer
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.120]   as you think about what your next year looks like.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.840]   So for me, I probably have a somewhat similar one to you
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.200]   in that I get a ton of energy out of creative activities.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.320]   And that's writing for me is a huge one.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.880]   Conversations with smart, interesting people is another one.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.160]   Extremely broadly, by the way,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.600]   this isn't like talking to successful people
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.000]   is what I get excited about.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.680]   I have fascinating conversations with Uber drivers,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.040]   with people that are helping me
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.120]   with things around the house.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.440]   I find that you can learn from almost anybody
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   when you open up to it.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.320]   And I get a ton of energy
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.240]   from hearing different people's stories,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.200]   different people's struggles.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.800]   It ends up inspiring a lot of the things
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   that I end up writing about as well.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   So that's a huge energy creator for me.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.000]   And then the last one is sort of productive leisure
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.080]   as a category.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.960]   I think about it, walking is a huge one for me.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.400]   I probably averaged close to 20,000 steps a day in 2022,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.640]   which was a huge number for me
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.840]   relative to anything I had done in the past,
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.000]   largely because my son would only sleep
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.680]   when he was taking on walks outside.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.360]   And so it forced me to be outside a lot.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.440]   And I just found that I was getting so much creative energy
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.280]   from walking and being out in nature.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.160]   So that was another big learning for me.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.880]   - To compliment that with what drained energy
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.280]   is the next one, right?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.200]   - Yeah, and it goes in tandem, as we said,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.280]   when you look at your calendar,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.480]   you're figuring out what were the things
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   that created energy.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600]   And then you're looking at the same time
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.080]   at what was the stuff that just drained me.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.120]   For a lot of people, this tends to be stuff
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.840]   like back-to-back meetings, phone calls,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.400]   the meetings to talk about future meetings,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.440]   processing email, doing things
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.000]   that are sort of monotonous activities
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.880]   that happen to hijack your day a lot of the time.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.800]   So figuring out what those activities are,
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.200]   what the trends are in them,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.720]   and then figuring out if you allowed those
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.000]   to take over your entire day,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.640]   or if you were able to sort of manage the balance
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.320]   that has to naturally exist across the energy creators
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.080]   and energy drainers.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.200]   - Funny enough, I think I took this
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.960]   in a slightly different perspective,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.440]   which was it wasn't the back-to-back meetings, all that stuff.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.240]   There were two things that I put here that I'll share.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.480]   One was fitting our children into our old life.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.840]   So my wife and I probably clocked in four, five, six,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.520]   seven trips a year when we were kidless pre-pandemic,
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.320]   whether they were weekend trips or drives
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.360]   or international trip.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.280]   And I think we had a great time in December
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.360]   going to London and Paris with two kids.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.280]   But I think trying to fit two small kids
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.720]   into the type of trip we would normally take
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.480]   actually drained a lot of energy.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.000]   And I think we probably would have been better off
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.360]   trying to think about the trip,
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.400]   not from a how do we get the best of both worlds,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.080]   but how do we maybe have one trip a year
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.720]   where we can get away on our own,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.400]   and one trip where we're taking it in a way
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.320]   that doesn't require as much effort and burden,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.680]   especially when kids are napping one, two, three times a day.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.600]   It's just, you're not gonna have that same experience.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.040]   So that was one.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.280]   And the other one was social media,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.640]   just feeling the need to put pressure to,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.080]   oh, I gotta post this much, this many places.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.040]   I was like, I found the content area that I love right now,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.960]   which is recording a podcast, writing a newsletter.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.760]   I really love those two things,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   but it drained me every time I was thinking,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.680]   oh, how do I clip it to a short form video
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.720]   and post it here and here?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.000]   We'll get to this later, 'cause I have some other thoughts,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.840]   but that was one where I think it just drained,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.480]   it drained, just trying to think about those things.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.360]   - Yeah, that one drains a lot of people
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.120]   in the creator ecosystem.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.000]   You can spread yourself way too thin
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.200]   across all of these different platforms
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   and get a lot of FOMO about like,
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.720]   oh, it's growing their podcast a lot
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.800]   by doing this and this.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.320]   On that platform, it's just, oh, I need to be doing that.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.440]   And it just like pulls you in that direction mentally,
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.600]   and the cognitive load ends up being, it destroys you.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.000]   Anything that drained you?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.640]   - The biggest one for me is always calls and meetings,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.520]   calls and Zoom meetings, I should say.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.000]   I love in-person meetings,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.520]   and so my big takeaway was calls,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.480]   like the get-to-know-you calls,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.000]   I'm just not doing anymore.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.200]   We're just not gonna do those.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.360]   My way to make sure that I still have
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.920]   those get-to-know-you things is doing them in person.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.760]   And basically, I'm an open book
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.080]   of meeting people in person in New York.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.560]   And New York, fortunately, tends to be one of the places
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.680]   that basically everyone comes through
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.960]   at some point or another.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.200]   And so if someone reaches out to me
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.840]   and they live in Vancouver and they wanna get together,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.120]   and I'm not doing calls,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.240]   'cause I'm not gonna do a get-to-know-you call,
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.400]   they tend to be coming to New York at some point
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.240]   within the next six months,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.680]   and we will get together in person and meet that way.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.400]   And it's been awesome so far
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.080]   since I started implementing the change.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.160]   Just the energy of meeting someone in person,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.360]   the friendships that get formed,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.520]   it's just on a different level
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.160]   from the Zoom call that you end up leaving and saying,
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.440]   hey, we should get drinks sometime,
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.800]   and you end up never connecting
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.040]   with the person in the future.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.000]   That, for me, is definitely number one going into this year.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.840]   - Going into this year,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.440]   the other thing I'm gonna do on that point is,
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.940]   if someone says, can we do a meeting?
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.760]   I'm just like, can we just do the phone call?
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.100]   Not every video call has to be a video call.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.240]   If this wasn't a video call,
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.680]   I feel like maybe we wouldn't connect as well.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.040]   But when we had a quick conversation before this,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.760]   we did it on the phone and it was fun.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.120]   - And you can do phone calls while walking, by the way.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.400]   Huge unlock for me is just,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.720]   I'll do phone calls while walking now when I need to.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   And it's a big unlock.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.920]   You actually think more clearly
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   when you're walking that way.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.400]   Unless you need to be in front of your computer
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.960]   for a specific reason, walking meetings are awesome.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.600]   - And if someone pushes back,
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.080]   if you wanna prevent the pushback,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.480]   they're like, hey, let's do a video call.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.560]   I say, hey, you know what?
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.520]   I find that when I'm doing a call on my computer,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.960]   I'm a bit more distracted 'cause there's email popping up.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.200]   So maybe we do a phone call and I'll just go on a walk
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.980]   and I'll be completely focused on you.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.360]   How's someone gonna push back there?
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.960]   You're like, do you want my attention
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.800]   or do you want part of it?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   - And it's 100% accurate, by the way.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   Think about how many windows you typically have up
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.000]   during a typical Zoom call
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and how often you're checking the notifications
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.920]   that pop up in the screen or looking at the internet
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.160]   or your email or whatever it is.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.340]   It's totally true.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.720]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.240]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.820]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.480]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.840]   as you build your wealth.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.120]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.980]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.120]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.680]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.080]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.040]   I've loved being a part of the community
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.360]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.480]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.840]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.560]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.360]   are first generation wealth,
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.440]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.560]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.920]   and learn from each other
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.520]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.800]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.140]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.560]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.720]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.680]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.160]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.600]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.960]   to your children's education,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.260]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.720]   So many of these conversations
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.920]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.600]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.460]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.560]   I encourage you to check out Longangle
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.880]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.400]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.320]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.400]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.440]   With travel back on the calendar
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.840]   and my kid in preschool,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.800]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.280]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   which is why I kickstart my day
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.200]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.920]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.800]   for this episode.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.320]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.080]   because I think it's the best option
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.960]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.680]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.400]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.680]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.640]   probiotics and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.120]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.280]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.340]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.860]   and energized for the day,
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.360]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.240]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.160]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.940]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.020]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.880]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.360]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.240]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.880]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.560]   to take ownership over your health
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   Okay, question four, this is one of my favorites.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   What or who were the boat anchors in my life?
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.440]   And boat anchors is a term that I created,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   so I need to explain it.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.280]   As you would expect, it is the thing
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   that is creating drag on your life.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.480]   When I think about boat anchors,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   I typically think about them as people,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.680]   and these are the people that are trying to hold you back.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.540]   It's the people that sort of snicker or laugh
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.880]   when you tell them what your ambitions are.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.080]   It's the people who put down your accomplishments
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.200]   or try to say that they're not as impressive
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.040]   as they otherwise were.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.480]   It's also the people who are saying that about others
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.880]   when you're talking to them and they're putting down others
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.240]   just in the general context of conversation.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.360]   These are boat anchors.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.340]   These are people that are literally placing a drag
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.800]   on your progress and holding you back from achieving
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.480]   at the next level that you're trying to get to.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.560]   So identifying who they are,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.800]   sitting down and reflecting on the relationships
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.040]   and the things in your life
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.080]   that might be holding you back in that way
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.160]   is a huge part of this reflection process
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.440]   because developing a plan to start minimizing the impact
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.240]   that those people have in your life is really key.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.280]   - For the sake of not being boat anchors ourselves,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.560]   I would say let's just skip through trying to talk about
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.600]   who these are in our lives, not be negative,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.040]   but I do think this is a productive step.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.320]   - We all have these people.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.920]   And so it's just being really clear.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.200]   We don't need to talk about who ours are,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.800]   but we all have these people in our lives
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.640]   and thinking about it clearly and sitting down
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   and really reflecting on it.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.720]   And it doesn't have to be that you tell the person,
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.200]   "Hey, you're cut out of my life, by the way."
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.340]   This is an important point.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.600]   You can identify these people and just slowly minimize
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.960]   their role within your ecosystem.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.240]   You don't need to hang out with them all the time, maybe.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.960]   You don't need to touch base with them quite as much
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.560]   as you did or tell them about the things
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.240]   that you're working on or thinking about.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.800]   It's just figuring out a way to minimize the impact
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.000]   of their drag in your life.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.960]   All right, question five.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   What did I not do because of fear?
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.320]   So this goes back to Tim Ferriss, who developed,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.840]   I think it was in four-hour work week,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.760]   the first time he talked about it,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.440]   but then there's a very famous TED talk
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.240]   where he talks about it, fear setting,
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.980]   which is generally the idea that we allow our fears
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.800]   to distort our reality.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.020]   And we build them up in our minds as much worse
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.860]   than they really are.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.760]   And so the concept of fear setting is to get much closer
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.120]   to your fears, to really deconstruct them
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.200]   and figure out, were they as bad as I thought?
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.800]   And what's the worst case that could happen?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.200]   What's the upside if I actually go and do this
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.400]   and then proceed accordingly?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.660]   So the whole idea is to go back and look at your year
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.800]   and figure out what did you actually shy away from doing?
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.160]   And then think about, okay, well, let me break that fear down.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.480]   How real was it?
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.080]   Because at the time you just passed on the opportunity
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.280]   due to that fear.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.540]   For me, this was just going full-time on all the hacks.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.280]   And it was so funny because a friend of mine,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.360]   shout out to Ben, who worked with me at Wealthfront,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.080]   who was like, "Why aren't you doing this?
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.960]   Like, why aren't you going full-time on this project?"
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.120]   And I was like, "Well, if I were giving my friend advice,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.040]   I would tell them that they need to go full-time on it."
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.680]   Like, it was so obvious.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.720]   I could use all the mindset tactics that I've learned
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.360]   from interviewing smart people, where it's like,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.560]   "Oh, what would your friend say?
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.640]   If your friend says you should do it,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.840]   then maybe you should take the advice."
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.480]   And I was like, "Well, I would give everyone advice.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.100]   Like, you're at this point where this is the time
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.940]   to capitalize."
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.760]   And I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   Part of it was like, "Oh, maybe I'll wait
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.320]   till the end of the year.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   Maybe I'll wait here, and I'm on parental leave
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   and all this stuff."
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.740]   And I'm happy that I did it,
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.720]   but I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   why it took me so long.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.120]   That was one that I just needed to break down
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.640]   and spend more time reflecting on.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.400]   - The waiting for the perfect moment is the bias here
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.320]   that almost everyone has.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.840]   We tell ourselves we're gonna do X at the perfect moment,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.360]   and it's not the perfect moment now.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.880]   And the reality is it's never the perfect moment
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.340]   to make those big leaps and to do those big jumps.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.180]   I've written about this.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.240]   Sometimes you literally just need to open the door
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.600]   and jump out and hope the parachute was packed tight
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.240]   and just make that leap.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.560]   And so deconstructing your fears
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.000]   and going through this exercise is really helpful.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.520]   I had the same one, by the way,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.880]   when I was thinking about making the leap to full-time
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.120]   into these personal pursuits a year earlier.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.160]   So in 2021, that was my thing that I held off on doing
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.240]   because of fear that ultimately sort of got forced upon me.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.560]   But that was definitely mine in 2021.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.300]   The other one is, and I still have this fear,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.700]   all of the businesses I've run
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.820]   have been venture capital-backed businesses
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.220]   where all the money you have as a company,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.580]   it's not like you get to keep it.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.940]   Basically, it's always in the company.
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.960]   So you're really motivated to spend it all,
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.060]   to try to grow and build a really big company
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.700]   because the benefits to you only come
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.420]   if that company really succeeds.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.700]   When you run a small business,
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.820]   which I'll call a podcast, "A Small Business,"
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.900]   it's like if that podcast makes money, you get the money.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.460]   That's how businesses that you own yourselves
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.620]   and you don't have investors work.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.000]   And so one thing that I'm struggling with
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.560]   is to take that money and go reinvest it
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.780]   into the business, if you will.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.020]   Hiring someone to help research or book guests
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.320]   or edit and produce.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.040]   And I feel like I've been able to chip away
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.720]   at smaller pieces, but making a big investment
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.060]   is something that I haven't been able to do yet.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.560]   And I see all these stories of successful business owners,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.860]   not the venture capital startup founder kind of people,
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.360]   but the overwhelming theme is that they all,
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.640]   they reinvest it in their business to grow it.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.140]   And so it's like, I know I need to do it.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.980]   I know I should do it.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.880]   I would give my friends advice to do it,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.200]   but it's so hard when it's basically
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   like reinvesting your own money.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.640]   And I think the mindset shift that I had
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.060]   that was so productive for personal savings
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.880]   was that every dollar I earned,
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.600]   I just immediately shelved in my brain
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.280]   as if it was my savings.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.200]   So I know a lot of people, the way they budget
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.120]   or the way they spend money, they spend their money,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.900]   but everything that's left over, they save.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.340]   Or they save 500 bucks a month
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.140]   and everything else they can spend.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.860]   For me, 100% of the money was savings.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.060]   And I treated every single purchase as if I was saying,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.060]   do I wanna dip into my savings to buy this coffee?
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.780]   Do I wanna dip into my savings to have dinner out?
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.320]   That was my process, which made me incredibly frugal,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.140]   probably not spend enough money and do enough things.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.340]   Now I have that same thing applied to business
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.420]   where it's like, do I wanna dip into my savings
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.020]   to hire someone to do this thing?
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.180]   And it just makes it harder to spend money.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.140]   - That's interesting.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.820]   I kind of did a structural thing from a business standpoint
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.380]   that might be useful for people
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.740]   that has been sort of a behavioral hack for me,
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.080]   which is I have an S-corp that's set up
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.740]   that has all of my kind of personal holding company entities
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.980]   running through it.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.900]   And all I do is with an S-corp,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.500]   you have to pay yourself a salary,
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.700]   a reasonable salary out of it.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.640]   And so that reasonable salary is what covers
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.780]   all of our home expenses and our whole life
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.620]   and everything there.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.300]   And so because of that, because it's two separate businesses
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.020]   that runs from my S-corp that pays a salary out
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.740]   to our personal joint bank account as a family,
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.100]   I then just think of that S-corp bank account
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.540]   as it's the business, it's the working capital.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.540]   And so everything there in my mind
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.020]   is segmented as totally separate.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.620]   I need to think about reinvesting.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.460]   What does it look like?
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.500]   What's the margin profile?
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.780]   What's the return on this investment, et cetera?
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.020]   And that's been a hugely helpful
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.800]   behavioral hack for me overall.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.200]   - So I just did my S-corp election.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.340]   So at the end of the year.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.180]   - Smart man.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.620]   - This is something that maybe will make it easier next year.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.700]   - Yeah, it definitely will.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.540]   It definitely will.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.340]   You just, the salary thing definitely makes a big difference
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.660]   versus the LLC.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660]   Six, ready?
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.480]   - Yep.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.180]   - Greatest hits and worst misses from the year.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.380]   The reason for doing this one is because we are all swayed
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.020]   by our natural bias.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.940]   So a optimist will see all the hits from the year.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.060]   They'll look at their year and pat themselves on the back
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.280]   and say, wow, I had a great year.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.340]   Look, this and this.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.400]   And the pessimist stares at their year and says,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.180]   oh my God, this was the worst.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.500]   I had all these things go wrong.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.620]   It was awful.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.100]   Doing a actual explicit list of your hits and your misses
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.300]   forces you to sort of be balanced
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.260]   and actually take a real look at the two sides of your life
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.480]   and success from a scoreboard standpoint.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.600]   So writing them all down, I find is hugely helpful.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.220]   - Which side do you skew on?
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.580]   - I would say I skew towards being self-critical.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.700]   I am, it probably comes from my athletic background.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.340]   I just like negative self-talk
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.700]   was always how I motivated myself athletically,
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.340]   which is a funny thing to say these days
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.660]   'cause everyone is very big on positive self-talk.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.980]   I always motivated myself by telling myself
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.820]   it wasn't good enough
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.540]   or the things I was doing wasn't good enough.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.620]   And as a result, if I sit down and think about my year,
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.780]   I tend to just glaze over the awesome things that happened
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.780]   and think about, oh, well, this didn't work out
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.600]   or I failed at this, quit this too early, whatever.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.040]   And so it helps for me to zoom out
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.460]   and actually think about the wins to balance all of that out.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.300]   What about you?
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   - When it comes to the future,
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.500]   I'm definitely in the optimist camp.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.580]   I'm like, it's always gonna work out.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.140]   Kids are gonna not even have jet lag when we travel.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   You're like, I'm always the one,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.860]   like what's the brightest side of things?
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.820]   But when it comes to myself,
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.020]   I am always the person that's like trying to find
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.820]   how to improve, at least crave the criticism.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.180]   So like if I'm cooking dinner for family
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.340]   and everyone's like, this is great.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.340]   I'm like, sure, it's great.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.300]   - What wasn't great?
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.820]   - Yeah, like what could have like,
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.020]   did it need a little more salt?
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.340]   Could I have cooked it a little longer?
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.860]   I know that I'm not Thomas Kell,
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.740]   I'm not a three Michelin star chef.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.660]   So telling me that this is fantastic,
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.060]   I wanna know how to make it better.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.580]   It's weird, forward looking,
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.340]   I'm much better at like thinking optimistically
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.980]   on myself and reflection.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.980]   I'm more like, oh God, I could have done this better.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.060]   - I definitely don't want honest feedback
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.340]   on my cooking for my family.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.780]   Like if I make steaks on the grill,
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.540]   I just want everyone to say like, these are amazing.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.380]   - That's so funny.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.340]   When everyone says these are amazing around our table,
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.660]   I get so frustrated.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.540]   I'm like, no, there's no way that this is a perfect steak.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.380]   What could have been better?
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.260]   - Well, you're gonna end up accelerating as a chef
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.020]   and I'm gonna kind of stay at my low baseline.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.860]   - That's okay.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.460]   I probably shouldn't focus on my cooking as much.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.980]   I'm clearly not gonna have a profession
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.060]   in the culinary arts.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.900]   - That's a good one though.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.660]   Okay, final question.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.580]   What did I learn this year?
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.240]   This is just the best place to wrap these up for me
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.620]   because it sort of captures everything.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.340]   You just did all of these questions,
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.380]   you sort of boil it all down and sit down
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.620]   and write down a list of the things that you learned
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.420]   and how did you grow and how did you learn
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.300]   and how did you develop during the course of the year?
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   So I always find this to be a great way
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.020]   to kind of summarize the whole exercise
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.460]   and really have a set of key takeaways.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.100]   - So I did this one wrong.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.380]   So I'm gonna share my failed experience.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.420]   - What did you do wrong?
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.900]   - I took it way too literally.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.720]   And I was like, what did I learn?
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.460]   And I was like, oh, well, Nick Gray taught me
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.020]   how to throw a good cocktail party.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.980]   - That totally counts.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.920]   I think that's great.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.760]   - Sure.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.980]   Okay, so maybe I didn't take it wrong,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.380]   but what I didn't do was what did I learn
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.100]   from going through questions one through six?
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.860]   Like I didn't do the tie it all up
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.340]   in a bow summary version of number seven.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.300]   I did the, here are all the things I learned.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.420]   And I was like, well, I could just go to every podcast.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.060]   I learned a bunch of stuff each episode.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.620]   I just had this massive list of all these things I learned.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.900]   What would have been maybe more effective,
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.100]   which I will probably do this afternoon or this evening,
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.340]   is like, let's take the previous six questions
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.620]   in this entire process and try to put a bow
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.420]   on the whole thing and what I learned
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.180]   and what that means for life ahead.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.540]   - Yeah, I think both are productive, to be honest.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.980]   I love the fact that you went and learned
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.780]   how to throw a good cocktail party from Nick Gray,
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.260]   who's awesome and best in class at throwing cocktail parties.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.460]   He threw an in-person event for Sam Parr and I
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.620]   that we hosted in New York this summer.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.500]   And I've never seen something so well coordinated
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   and organized.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.540]   It was amazing.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.340]   That guy is world-class.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.460]   So that's a great one.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.540]   I love that one.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.300]   Obviously, we're talking about reflection,
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.880]   but I wanna talk a little bit about the year ahead.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.420]   But I do wanna ask,
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.100]   you mentioned very briefly at the beginning,
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.420]   things that made it easy for you to go back,
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.220]   like journaling or sending yourself emails.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.740]   Are there things that people should be thinking about
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.700]   in the year ahead that will make this process easier
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.140]   in the future, whether it's a monthly review
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.060]   or journaling, things like that?
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.580]   - Yeah, I do a monthly review
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.140]   that I think is super important.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.620]   And I do this for a number of reasons.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.420]   The biggest one for me is when you have a plan
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.460]   for the year, which if you're listening to this podcast,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.060]   you're probably a planner.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.420]   You probably like to set your course for the year
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.220]   at the beginning and figure out where you're heading,
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.540]   your North Star, if you will.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.460]   But the biggest challenge with that is a year
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.700]   is just such a long time and changing.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.500]   You get the whole like one in 60 rule
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.820]   that I think was in Atomic Habits
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.180]   is if you're off by one degree,
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.260]   you're gonna miss your target by a mile
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.580]   for every 60 miles flown.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.180]   And it's super, super impactful.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.740]   And I think about it a lot.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.640]   So I sit down at the end of every month
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.080]   and I try to ask myself a set of questions
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.500]   and just reflect on the month from the past.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.820]   What were the really important things in my life?
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.260]   Was I focusing on those?
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.740]   Did I actually spend time on the really important things
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.820]   or was my attention grabbed elsewhere?
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.940]   Are my daily systems, the things that I'm doing
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.960]   on a daily basis actually in line
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.180]   and aligned with what my long-term goals are,
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.720]   my midterm goals are?
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.380]   So I do sit down at the end of every month
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.300]   and try to either, for me personally,
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.700]   I like to write down by hand.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.260]   Some people like using Notion or some digital tool
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.800]   or sending themselves an email.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.500]   But for me, being able to have that then as a record
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.980]   that I can go back and look at
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.140]   in addition to anything else I've collected from the year
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.660]   like calendars, et cetera,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.780]   tends to be a really helpful exercise.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.060]   - You've published, I think somewhere
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.900]   that monthly review process, is that right?
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.780]   Can we like, we can link to that.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.180]   - Yeah, I released an annual planning guide
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.540]   after the annual review guide,
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.460]   which has my whole kind of process
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.620]   for setting out the long-term goals.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.060]   I think about checkpoint goals that are in between
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.780]   the daily systems that come there,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.980]   the anti-goals, what we want to avoid,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.300]   the Pyrrhic victory, like avoid winning the battle
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.900]   but losing the war with these goals.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.580]   And then finally, how to think about tracking and adjusting,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.620]   which is really that monthly review process.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.300]   So I did have that out somewhere
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.220]   and people can find that, we can put it in the show notes.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.060]   - Perfect.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.260]   And journaling is something that I haven't adopted
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.780]   as a habit, but it seems like the data out there is like,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.700]   it's a really good habit.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.820]   Like it seems like everybody should be doing this.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.260]   - Oh, it's the best habit.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.620]   I finally figured out how to do this.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.380]   I spent five years, to be honest,
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.260]   like five years telling myself at the beginning
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.140]   of every year that I was going to become a journaler
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.480]   because of the impact that it has on your mental health
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.980]   and your ability to change course and reflect.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.340]   And literally I would come into the year,
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.180]   every year I'd say I was going to do it.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.500]   I would set up this like complex journaling process
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   with these fancy notebooks and these pens
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.740]   and all this stuff, 'cause that's just how I'm wired
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.540]   and set aside 30 minutes a night to sit down
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.020]   and reflect and do all this stuff.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:59.340]   And without fail, five days in, I would miss a day
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.740]   and then the whole thing would get derailed
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.380]   and I wouldn't journal for the rest of the year.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.580]   And so I finally made progress
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.060]   and figured out a system that works
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.820]   by just simplifying it to like a two minute process
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.580]   where I just do, I call it my one, one, one method.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   And it's one win from the day.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.060]   So one thing that went well, that you did well,
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.980]   one point of tension, anxiety, stress,
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.820]   like one thing that's just on your chest
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.980]   that you need to get off and get down on paper.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.500]   And then one point of gratitude.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.420]   It can be as tiny as like a smell
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.640]   that you really enjoy during the day,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.620]   or it can be huge, the health of your family,
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.620]   whatever it might be.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.540]   But writing those three points down every single night,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.180]   it has just been this enormous unlock for my life.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.140]   And it's so simple that literally anyone can do it
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.460]   and you don't have an excuse not to,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.900]   'cause it can take one minute
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.380]   to go and sit down and write it.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.920]   And if you are struggling on one of those three things,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.640]   do you sit there and think it out or do you just skip it?
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.140]   Or what advice would you give to someone who's like,
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.820]   "God, I just can't think of something."
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.700]   I try to do it from like complete word dump mindset.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.660]   Like I don't wanna overthink it too much.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.700]   I wanna just do the first thing that comes to my mind,
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.580]   the first win that I can think of from the day.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   It can be as simple as like,
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.100]   "I got up at the time I said I was gonna get up."
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.200]   Because it just gives you like a nice pat on the back,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.740]   where if you feel like you lost the day,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.320]   like you feel like you had a tough day,
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   that first win that comes to your mind
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.500]   and you can write it down, it's so impactful.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.740]   And everyone has tension or stress.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.980]   No one is ever going to be without one of those
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.820]   from a given day.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.860]   You always had something.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.760]   So it tends to be like either the win
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.980]   or the point of gratitude is tougher.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.820]   The win is usually the hardest for people.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.620]   Like open up the aperture of what qualifies as a win
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.960]   in your life, if you will.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.340]   Everyone thinks it has to be some amazing big thing,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.440]   but it can be as tiny as,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.780]   "I got up out of bed when I thought,
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.100]   "I took a shower in the way that I wanted to."
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.500]   Like the smallest little thing
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.260]   can count as a win in your life.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.420]   Last night, I had an apple instead of dessert.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.260]   And for anyone who listened--
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.100]   - Help God.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.940]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.900]   That's how I felt.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.980]   It's that meme where you're like, "Ah."
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.220]   I felt like a hero.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.660]   And I recorded an episode yesterday with Jordan Schlane,
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.340]   who's a doctor and he's awesome.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.600]   And we talked a lot about this.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.320]   So I think that episode will have already come out
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.480]   by the time people hear this.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.240]   So you'll know why I was so excited about eating an apple.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.540]   But that would have been my win if I had written that down.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.420]   - It's a great one.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.660]   Do you write it digitally or do you write it with a pen?
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.980]   - I write with pen and paper.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.980]   I just find the process of actually writing on paper
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.720]   to be pretty therapeutic.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.060]   I have terrible penmanship.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.340]   I need to get much better about that.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.220]   Actually, when I tweeted this whole method out,
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.520]   I tweeted a picture of my journal
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.980]   and got dunked on by a bunch of people
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.860]   for how bad my handwriting is, but such is life.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.420]   - So that's one thing to take into 2023.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.440]   But I know you wrote a post that I really liked
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.280]   or a newsletter.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.020]   You've been very good at, "Here's my content.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.260]   "If you wanna consume it on Twitter,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.100]   "you can consume it here.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.180]   "You wanna consume it on Instagram,
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.060]   "you can consume it here.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.500]   "Or you can subscribe to the newsletter," which I do.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.780]   And one was about 23 things to take into 2023.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.980]   So I thought we would wrap this up
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.320]   and go through highlights.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.620]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.500]   Subscribe to the newsletter for sure.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.780]   But just a few of these things,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.460]   since you broke them down into categories,
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.300]   what do you think?
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.380]   - Okay, yeah, let's do it.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.180]   - All right, so your first category was work.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.260]   I'll let you hit on a few, your favorites.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.620]   If unprompted, great.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.140]   And if not, I'll prompt you with a couple
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.500]   that I think are worth bringing up.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.460]   - Okay, well, the first one connects directly
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.500]   to the annual review.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.900]   So I think it's a great one to start on
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.100]   'cause it'll help people
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.540]   as they think about this coming year.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.540]   I call this my energy calendar technique.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.780]   - It sounds like something from like Sedona, Arizona
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.020]   with crystals in the room.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.340]   - Yeah, you got the vortex, the Sedona vortex.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.180]   I love that.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.060]   Sedona's amazing, by the way.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.700]   Everyone should go there at some point in their life.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.980]   The energy calendar technique
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.660]   is basically a simple color coding strategy
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.620]   to figure out over the course of a week or two
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   what it is in your life that's creating energy
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.860]   and what's draining energy.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.940]   So the way I do it is take a week
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.480]   when you're gonna do this,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.820]   go through a workday,
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.900]   at the end of the day, look at your calendar
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.040]   and make changes to the color of the things
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.340]   on your calendar based on what created energy,
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.500]   what was sort of neutral,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.100]   and what drained energy from you.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.140]   And literally go change the color of those things
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   on the day that just passed.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.460]   So if something created energy, you mark it as green.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.340]   If it was neutral, you mark it as yellow.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.620]   And if it drained energy, you mark it as red.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.900]   Do that every single day for a week, maybe two weeks,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.600]   and then go back and look at it.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.620]   And you'll immediately be able to viscerally,
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.100]   very clearly identify trends
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.020]   in what created energy in your life,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.700]   which you need to amplify and try to spend more time on,
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.340]   what was neutral, which you can kind of continue to leave
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.140]   or potentially try to delegate,
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.700]   and then what was draining energy from your life.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.820]   And with those, the whole idea
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.420]   is to start slowly working your way
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.740]   towards being able to delegate
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.740]   or delete those from your life.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.700]   - The one thing that I'm gonna try with this
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.300]   is there's times,
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.780]   especially when you're working on your own schedule,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.020]   like I am, where I'll be doing something,
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.500]   but I didn't put it in my calendar.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.540]   I'm not as good as others
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.100]   at time blocking the whole perfect day.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.920]   But at the end of the day,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.020]   it'd be really easy for me to be like,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.860]   "Oh, for this hour, I researched this topic."
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.180]   So if you do it at the end of the day,
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180]   it could be really quick.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.540]   So I'm gonna go in back and also add other things.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.540]   - I'm also bad, by the way, at time boxing.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.020]   I think time boxing is near et al, who is amazing.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.900]   And I think it's a great technique for a lot of people.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.300]   I really struggle with having every minute
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.380]   of my calendar filled.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.500]   Just optically, it intimidates me about the day.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.940]   Even if a block literally says,
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.460]   "Go on a walk with your son,"
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.060]   it's intimidating to me to see at the beginning of a day
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.100]   every minute filled.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.980]   So I have huge open blocks.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.800]   So I actually do exactly what you just said.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.120]   I'll go back and say,
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.820]   "Oh, I did this piece of research here.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.300]   I did this here," et cetera.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.060]   - This holiday season,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.140]   I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.100]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.460]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.700]   If you feel the same way,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.420]   you should be giving them story worth,
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.900]   which is an incredible gift
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.660]   I've given to the people I care about,
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.980]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.780]   Story worth is an online service
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.100]   that helps you and your loved ones
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.540]   preserve precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.460]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.780]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.540]   Each week, Story Worth emails your relative or friend
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.780]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.820]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.640]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.920]   you've never thought about,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.940]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.740]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.820]   what would you want to find out?
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.020]   After a year, Story Worth will compile
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.620]   all your loved ones' stories,
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.680]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.740]   that you'll be able to share
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.900]   and revisit for generations to come,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.360]   which, now that we have kids,
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.700]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.380]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.540]   Reading the weekly stories
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.160]   helps connect you with loved ones
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.740]   no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.100]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.660]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.380]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.180]   back when he was in the military.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.720]   With Story Worth, I'm giving those I love most
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.780]   a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.760]   and preserving their memories and stories
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.180]   for years to come.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.340]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth

[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.860]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.500]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.420]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.860]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.580]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.140]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.580]   to help protect your family
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.940]   and cross that important to do off your list,
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.620]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.580]   for this episode.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.180]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.700]   to help you get a high-quality,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.420]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.180]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.980]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.380]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.940]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.960]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.980]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.680]   not available in certain states,
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.900]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.980]   Well, speaking of walks, let's talk about taking breaks
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.220]   'cause I know that was in there, number four.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.780]   This is all about attention residue,
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.620]   which is a concept that I think one of your prior guests,
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.360]   Cal Newport, has written about in the past
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.580]   that I've become somewhat obsessed with.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.920]   Generally, just this idea
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.500]   that we're always context switching
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.200]   because of the world that we live in
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.700]   with constant notifications.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.100]   So you'll be working on something
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.820]   and then you decide to check your email.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.980]   And when you check your email,
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.380]   there's this tiny cognitive load
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.180]   that is now stuck in that email
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.900]   when you come back to the work.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.540]   And you're just getting spread thin.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.840]   You're literally just like leaving
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.420]   your kind of mental capacity
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.660]   in all of these different places,
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.340]   in your messages, in your emails, et cetera.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.620]   And so then when you're going back
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.360]   and working on the really important thing,
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.220]   you're operating at like 60%
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.280]   of what your optimal mental capacity is.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.840]   And obviously as a result, your work is gonna suffer.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.520]   So this whole idea is we need to minimize
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.160]   the impact of attention residue.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.240]   Attention residue is that actual scientific side of that
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.080]   when that happens
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.400]   and your attention is grabbed in different places.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.300]   And taking breaks is really a key way to get around this.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.120]   And so the biggest way that I think most people
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.840]   can put this into their schedule and into their lives
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.900]   is schedule 25 minute meetings
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.320]   instead of 30 minute meetings.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.480]   And immediately you'll see a difference
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.620]   rather than having the context switch
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.040]   that comes from having back to back meetings
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.120]   that are just pushing you from one thing to the next.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.940]   When your mind is still in the prior meeting
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.780]   while you're in the new one
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.000]   or your mind's on the next meeting
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.940]   while you're in this one,
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.160]   you create an actual separation window.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.500]   You can go for a quick walk.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.080]   You can sit and just breathe.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.560]   It has a massive impact immediately.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.240]   And by the way, if anyone doesn't know this,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.360]   it's a setting in Google Calendar
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.760]   to turn on speedy meetings,
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.960]   which takes 30 minute meetings, makes them 25,
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.800]   takes hour meetings and makes them 50 minutes.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   So you don't even have to like work hard to do it.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.200]   You could just enable the feature.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.280]   And then when you drag an hour long meeting,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.760]   it auto readjust to 50 minutes.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.600]   That's a great hack.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.420]   I love that.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.400]   I think this pairs well with your number seven
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.180]   about batching email into Windows to process.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.720]   Yeah, this one has been a huge push for me personally,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.000]   which is I just found myself constantly checking emails
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.680]   and texts throughout the entire day.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.200]   And so when I started really focusing
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.520]   on minimizing attention residue,
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.120]   I thought about what's the best way for me
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.480]   to minimize the impact that has.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.000]   And what I did was I just set a one hour block
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.040]   late in the day,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.560]   which was when I was going to actually check email.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.720]   And initially I definitely wasn't perfect about it.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.440]   I'm still not a hundred percent compliant.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.640]   I will still pop it open
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.000]   because I have the finance gene in me
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   where I feel like I need to be on email 24/7.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.040]   But having a window of discrete time
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.960]   when you're actually gonna process those emails
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.680]   allows you to minimize how it impacts
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.860]   the other parts of your day.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.200]   And then also you really focus on the emails
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.740]   and you think clearly about the things
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.980]   and the questions people are asking
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:53.840]   when you're working on them,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   because that becomes the core thing
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.280]   that you're doing during that time,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.100]   rather than it being just a little distraction
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.360]   and you're trying to process it as quickly as you can
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.240]   between meetings.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.640]   So that one's really impactful.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.140]   It depends on what your career track is
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.660]   and what you're working on
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.200]   to think about how many of those windows there need to be,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.440]   how long they have to be.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.960]   If you work in professional services,
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.680]   if you're a lawyer, if you're an investment banker,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.800]   if you're a consultant, it's rich for you to think
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.360]   that you can have a one hour window
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.860]   when you're doing email, it's ridiculous.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.640]   I worked in finance, you can't do that.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   But can you have three of those windows during the day
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.480]   and get away with it?
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.640]   Probably, you could probably have one early in the day,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.840]   one around lunchtime and one in the evening
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.260]   and be in a good spot
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.480]   where you're still getting those periods of deep work
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.120]   when you can really think about things,
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.080]   but then you also have those fixed times
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.800]   where you're processing and moving through stuff.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.640]   So I think there's a happy medium for everyone to find
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.160]   that'll really optimize this.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.480]   I don't know the science behind this,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.200]   but my gut would say that part of the reason
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.320]   we love checking our emails,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.900]   'cause every time something comes in,
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.360]   it's like someone's wanting to talk to you.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.820]   There's this dopamine hit of seeing this thing.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.460]   I can say that when you start batching your emails,
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.160]   you just increase the likelihood
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.460]   that some interesting thing is gonna be there
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.680]   every single time you check your email.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.960]   So the end of this recording,
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.480]   I'm gonna go check my email and I'm gonna be like excited
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.840]   because I know that there's actually something interesting.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.200]   Whereas when you're in the habit
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.240]   of checking your email all the time,
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.200]   90% of those times, it's just some stupid spam thing.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.320]   It's something unimportant.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.260]   But now when I batch my emails,
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.480]   every time I check my email,
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.160]   if it's only two or three times a day,
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.640]   there's usually something valuable and interesting in there.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   So I actually get a lot of satisfaction
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.600]   when I've gone without email for a little while.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.960]   I get that dopamine hit of like,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.500]   oh, there's one great thing every time.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.720]   - You're a really positive guy.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.560]   I like this about you.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.380]   That's great.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.480]   I'm a dread email guy.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.400]   I'm trying to avoid the stressful thing
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.240]   that's coming into my inbox.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.080]   - No, I'm excited.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.560]   Like what exciting thing could be here?
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.400]   - And by the way,
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.200]   doing the same thing with text messages
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.880]   has been a great change for me
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.400]   'cause it's the same exact impact.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.120]   When you're checking texts throughout the day.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.580]   My goal for 2023 is to try to do this with social media
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.000]   because popping open Twitter once an hour
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.880]   and looking at things and doom scrolling
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.760]   and seeing what notifications or who's yelling at you
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.300]   or sending you mean DMs,
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.220]   just like super, super counterproductive for deep work.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.240]   - For Twitter, one thing I've done
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   is just relentlessly unfollow.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.200]   You don't even have to unfollow.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.240]   You can mute a person so you can still DM them,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.400]   but you don't have to see their tweets
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.800]   to the point that there's just not that many people
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.620]   in your feed.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.520]   So your feed is something you can manage
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.720]   and actually like maybe complete in the day.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.560]   It's like--
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.020]   - Did you turn to the latest tweet setting
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.960]   or are you still on?
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.780]   'Cause now that they've changed the algorithm,
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.460]   like the home feed is tons of stuff
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.720]   of people you don't follow.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.440]   - Yeah, so I still use TweetBot
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.520]   because I don't like that in the Twitter app
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.080]   and I don't like seeing sponsored tweets.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.760]   Like it just, so I still use TweetBot
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.000]   as my main Twitter app.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.540]   And there are reasons it sucks.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.440]   Like it's delayed on getting notifications from DMs,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.960]   but throughout this conversation,
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.280]   I'm wondering if maybe that's a good thing.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.120]   I would love to see the Twitter app
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.220]   be something that I could use more regularly,
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.160]   but I don't use it much right now.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.020]   - The hack here is you go to the little like star icon
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.340]   in the top right of your Twitter thing
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.160]   and just change it to latest tweets
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.620]   rather than doing the home.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.920]   And it means that it just does it in chronological order
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.840]   and it's basically only people you follow.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.200]   And so that cleans up your feed immediately.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.160]   You don't have all the stuff
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.560]   that Twitter is serving up to you.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.940]   - Does it sync between platforms?
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:17.780]   - No, it doesn't.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.160]   I literally just checked this
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.180]   'cause I had my Mac OS Twitter app was on latest,
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.720]   but my phone is somehow not.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.000]   I'm now gonna go fix that.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.520]   - TweetBot for me, since I only follow a handful of people
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.320]   and they're like news sources and people,
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.700]   I could just go on my computer
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.400]   and it's like there are 12 unread tweets.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.160]   I just roll up and then when I go to my phone,
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.000]   it jumps right to that same spot in the feed.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:37.840]   But- - I love it.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.320]   Hopefully Twitter can get their act together.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.800]   The one thing I'll add to this,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   so I guess by the end of this,
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:45.360]   it might be 26 things or 27 things to take into 2023,
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.760]   is from my reflections,
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.880]   which is just learn to outsource tasks
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   to increase the ROI of your time.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.820]   I will say, depending on what industry you work in,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.420]   this may or may not be allowed.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.520]   So check with your company.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.020]   If you work for yourself, you have a lot more flexibility,
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.660]   but there are certainly tasks during the day
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.120]   that I'm sure someone else could do
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.640]   and give you more time to spend on the things
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.320]   that are the most high ROI for your time,
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.040]   especially if your company would support you
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.760]   maybe hiring a virtual assistant
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.920]   to help do some of these things.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   I've seen a handful of examples of people,
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.080]   especially in sales, where they were able to hire people,
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.760]   their company wasn't gonna give them the budget.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.560]   So they just personally freelance hired people
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.600]   and convinced the company that they should have the budget
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.840]   to bring this person on
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.160]   so that they could spend their time closing the deals
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.020]   and drive up the actual output they got.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.980]   Their salary went up, even net of what they had to pay out.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.160]   So I think there are a lot of opportunities to outsource,
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.320]   to optimize where you spend your time.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.520]   - Yeah.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.480]   - All right, health?
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.440]   - Health, all right.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.200]   Well, there's a couple in here that are my go-to.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.560]   So the first one is something
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.000]   that I started doing in college,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.960]   which I guess I will loosely call the 55530 method.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.680]   And the reason I will loosely call it that
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.720]   is because someone else called it that.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.680]   I put it in this like life hacks document
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.360]   that I did maybe six months ago.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.480]   And then someone wrote a Twitter thread on it
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.920]   without citing me actually,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.140]   because they thought that it was like a well-known method.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.440]   And it was literally just something that I created
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.960]   and started doing in college that no one knows about.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.400]   So it's pretty funny to me that it now has a name.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.000]   But basically this is as soon as you wake up
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   and get out of bed, you do five squats,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.560]   five lunges per leg, five pushups and a 30 second plank.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.840]   And all this does is just immediately sparks
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.040]   your energy and metabolism to start the day.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.680]   It's like a simple thing, right?
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.500]   Five pushups.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.340]   It's not like you're saying,
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.360]   "Oh, I'm gonna do a hundred pushups
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.320]   as soon as I get out of bed."
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.820]   It's a low enough amount that it's not intimidating
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.760]   and you can force yourself to just quickly do it
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.600]   to start the day.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.900]   You can do it while your coffee's getting made
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.660]   or literally as soon as you get out of bed.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.640]   But it gives you this huge energy boost to start the day.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.040]   And I think it's hugely impactful.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.180]   I started doing it because we had these early morning
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.900]   baseball practices in college.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.700]   And it's just a habit that's now stuck with me
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.220]   throughout my life.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.700]   - What else do you do in the morning?
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.540]   I'm curious.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.100]   I think there are a few things in your health list
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   that are morning routine.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.140]   - Yeah.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.140]   I get out of bed.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.800]   I drink a whole bunch.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.860]   I keep a cold water on my bedside table.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.500]   So as soon as I wake up, I drink a whole ton of water.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.980]   I do the five, five, five, 30 really quickly,
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.540]   just like on the floor on the side,
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.580]   trying to stay quiet.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.180]   'Cause I wake up earlier than my wife.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.100]   And then I go get in a cold plunge.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.140]   So this is a new ad.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.660]   I got the cold plunge in July of 2022
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.660]   and have done every single day since,
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.600]   three to seven minutes in it every morning at 39 degrees.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.020]   And that's been probably the biggest impact on my life
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.980]   of a single thing that I've added to my routine
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.460]   in the last like five or 10 years.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.760]   I've experienced just a massive set of benefits
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.640]   in terms of energy and in terms of the dopamine rush
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.480]   that I get from it.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.360]   The surge that just lasts for hours,
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.080]   that just makes me feel superhuman
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.480]   during the early part of my day.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.120]   That's been the big ad for me.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   - Yeah, we just created a space in our home
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.220]   where a cold plunge will one day go.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.160]   - I don't know enough of the science to say
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.800]   like the brown fat and the metabolism and the immunity.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.040]   And there's all this research,
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.160]   Dr. Huberman has talked about it, I think on an episode
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   that shows all of these great health benefits.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.000]   But if nothing else other than the dopamine rush
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.040]   and the feeling of doing something hard
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.400]   that makes the rest of the day feel easier,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.280]   it would be worth it to me.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.360]   I've absolutely loved it.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.960]   I think it's phenomenal.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:12.800]   - Awesome.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.840]   Anything else you do in the morning?
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:16.880]   Well, number nine was about a tech free walk.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.900]   - Oh yeah, this is with my son now,
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.920]   which is even better on all of this.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.080]   But waking up in the morning, doing those things
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.720]   and then just going out and getting sunlight.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.360]   Again, this is like goes back to a thing
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.920]   that Dr. Huberman has talked about a lot,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.400]   the impact of getting sun first thing in the morning.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.920]   And that can be on a cloudy day,
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.080]   you just have to stay out longer, there still is sun.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.280]   But having that kind of just being able to breathe,
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.760]   not having your phone on you so that you're not looking
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.920]   and checking messages, checking email,
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.640]   checking social media, et cetera,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.200]   is a great way to start your day,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.920]   set your body in the right direction.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.040]   It improves your mood, it improves your sleep.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.820]   The next night, a whole host of health benefits.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.360]   But for me personally, just from a cognitive standpoint,
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   to start my day with a feeling of breathing and creativity,
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.860]   it has been a great habit.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.440]   I'm gonna add a couple, I'll do them quick
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.520]   'cause there are actually four.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.680]   And most of them came from this conversation
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.460]   I had about health a couple weeks ago.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.400]   Technically I had a day ago,
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.780]   but by the time you're listening to this,
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.220]   it'll be a couple weeks ago.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.000]   So one, we talked about how one of the most valuable things
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.840]   you could do is just time restricted eating.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.880]   So you call it intermittent fasting,
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.740]   you can call it whatever you want,
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.200]   but just keeping your eating window to a smaller time.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   That's something that I had done for a while,
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.680]   took a pause in the holidays
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.000]   and hopefully will bring back this year.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.760]   Another is we talked about Jordan, who I spoke with,
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.660]   was like one of his diagnostic things
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:30.780]   is going through who are you
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.420]   and just collecting the basic data
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.880]   and diagnostics about your health.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.480]   So I'm gonna encourage a lot of people
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.760]   who haven't done this to consider it,
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.580]   which is just like get your basic metabolic panel,
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.860]   like your blood work done.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.200]   I know a lot of us when we're young,
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.260]   we're like, "Ah, everything seems fine."
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.480]   But trying to figure out,
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.260]   is there an area you need to work on?
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.740]   For me, it was cholesterol.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.200]   That's my area right now,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.620]   but for everyone else, it could be different.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.500]   So just doing that.
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.420]   There's some great companies that can support that,
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.900]   by the way, you can look up the different ones.
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.080]   I'm not affiliated with any,
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.520]   but I've used Inside Tracker in the past.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.420]   It's relatively pricey, but it's an incredible experience.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.920]   And they have a great kind of dashboard
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.720]   that allows you to track it over time as well.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.800]   They are a partner of the show,
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.320]   so everybody gets 20% off.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.880]   So bring that price down a little.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.440]   Another one he pointed out was stop using alarms.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.560]   And this will be interesting one to hear your reaction to,
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   'cause I know you wake up early.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.480]   And he said, "Switch from a wake up alarm
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.520]   "to a bedtime alarm."
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.720]   Once you learn how much sleep your body needs
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.140]   to naturally wake up,
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.600]   then instead of setting your alarm for 5 a.m.,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.800]   which I think is something you do,
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.880]   figure out how much sleep you need
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.320]   and set your go to bed alarm.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.920]   Because there's just so much magic that happens
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.040]   while you're asleep,
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.900]   that interrupting that process
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.360]   can have an impact on your health.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.580]   And if you could force that to be different, that's better.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.980]   So I actually don't use an alarm in the morning,
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.880]   because I've gotten pretty good at waking up naturally
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.720]   around the same time,
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.560]   as long as I go to bed at the right time.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.540]   That's an interesting one.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.880]   I've always just loved alarms.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.180]   So I'm not trying to take it away, just switch.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.960]   I originally needed them
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.240]   because I just wasn't sleeping enough.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.560]   And so I just needed to get up early.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.180]   When I was working in finance in my early days,
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.960]   I was getting up at like 3.45,
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.680]   going to bed probably by 10.30.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.000]   I just wasn't sleeping enough for like a period of six years.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.960]   I've recently, over the last year and a half,
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.680]   started taking sleep very seriously.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.580]   And now I just have a grandpa schedule, man.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.400]   I'm asleep by 8.30
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.700]   and I'm up by between four and five, depending on the day.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.280]   And I get my seven to eight hours and I feel great.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.040]   And I wake up and I don't have an issue with it,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.520]   but maybe I should experiment with it.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.040]   And then the last was along the lines of that apple.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.640]   I had this negative impression of fruit
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.460]   my whole last few years.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.620]   I was like, well, fruit has sugar.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.920]   If fruit is sugar, can't be good for you.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.200]   And if I'm gonna have sugar, why not eat a cookie?
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.400]   My wife has told me that was crazy forever.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.160]   And we finally dug into the science behind it.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.620]   And it's like, fruit is actually pretty good.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.840]   There are some fruits that are not as good as others.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.320]   Like I think a mango,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.720]   especially when it's dried or in juice form,
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.700]   is maybe more like a soft drink than something.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.740]   But I'm gonna try as part of this cholesterol plan
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.760]   to replace dessert with like fruit and dark chocolate.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.780]   It's a great approach, by the way, for limiting calories.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.160]   Like you get the sweetness hit,
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.980]   but you don't have the negative impact.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.820]   So I love that one.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.640]   That's a great ad.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.620]   And the amount of fiber in an apple,
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.460]   like you just can't have five apples.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.580]   Like I can tell everyone listening from experience,
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.900]   you can have five cookies.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.820]   Like it is a physically possible thing.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.420]   I don't think I could eat five apples.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.480]   No, you definitely couldn't.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.580]   And by the way, this all goes to one of my health hacks,
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.160]   which is to just do all of your shopping
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.020]   on the outer perimeter of the grocery store.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.620]   If you just do that, you will immediately get healthier,
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.700]   lose weight, be in better shape, et cetera,
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.020]   because all of the good stuff is on the outer aisles
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.020]   and all the bad stuff is on the inner aisles.
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.940]   Fun, financial, kind of psychological money hack
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.600]   that I learned in an episode a long time ago
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.920]   was that if you walk the grocery store in the reverse order,
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.380]   on average, people save, I can't remember the percent,
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.300]   but they spend less.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.020]   Because like the grocery stores, you think it's like,
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.700]   oh, they managed to put this thing on this aisle.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.820]   I was like, no, they very meticulously engineered
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.860]   every aspect of your grocery store
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.300]   for you to spend the most amount of money possible.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.940]   And just by going to the back
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:00.100]   and working your way around the other way,
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.420]   you will avoid certain marketing things,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.420]   certain various elements
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.660]   that are trying to get you to spend.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.780]   It's like Ikea, man.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.020]   Ikea has that maze that you have to go through at the end
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.340]   that is so perfectly engineered
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.700]   to make you buy shit you don't need.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.520]   I remember one time we were like,
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.180]   we just need to find an accent chair.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.700]   And I was like, it is so hard to get to anywhere in Ikea
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.500]   without following the map.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.980]   Like, there's like a couple like hidden doors.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:24.940]   You're like, can I go through this?
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.900]   I just need a chair.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.740]   Oh, so good.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.560]   So that's health.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.400]   Jordan and I actually talked about
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.540]   doing some follow-up episodes.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.860]   So I wanna get more serious on that this year.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.340]   I'm excited for Peter Attia's book,
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.100]   "Outlive" coming out later this year.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.420]   All right, let's talk about personal
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.900]   before we wrap and money.
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.280]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.580]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.420]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.020]   Okay, personal, again,
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.340]   going back to one of your prior guests, Cal Newport.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.620]   I think this is back in college.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.740]   I first read this from him.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.900]   He had a blog piece about like a shutdown ritual
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.060]   or something like that.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.420]   I call it a power down ritual,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.460]   but basically creating a very fixed separation
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.780]   between your professional life and your personal life
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.860]   is something that you can do
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.820]   that immediately improves your mental health
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.060]   and has definitely had an impact on my life.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:25.180]   This is like establishing a sequence of events
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.020]   that you do at the end of your day
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   that mentally and literally marks the end of your workday.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.700]   So it might be like checking messages for the last time
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.380]   and firing off any last emails that you need to set.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.220]   Might be doing the little bit of prep
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.580]   for your next morning's work
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.700]   to kind of set yourself up to hit the ground running.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.760]   Might be checking Slack.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.660]   Whatever it is, you kind of do this one set sequence
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.780]   of a couple of events.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.900]   And then in Cal's original blog piece,
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.700]   he actually advocated saying something out loud,
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.180]   like having kind of like a nerdy,
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.980]   actual like shutdown sequence initiated thing
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.480]   that triggers in your mind that the day is over.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.580]   And the whole goal is that
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.920]   once you do this shutdown sequence, you're off.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.340]   You're not checking email.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.100]   You're not going and looking at things.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.180]   That's it for the day.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.740]   And it's just a really helpful practice,
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.320]   especially in this hybrid and remote work world
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.160]   that we're living in,
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.060]   where it's so easy to let professional and personal blur.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.220]   I don't have a ritual yet.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.040]   And I think people learn this when you have kids.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.780]   It's like, you want to have your quality family time
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.100]   'cause you're working during the day.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.660]   You kind of have to do this, but I don't have a ritual.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.140]   And I feel like I'm going to bring that one into this year.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.980]   So. It's a good one.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.820]   I like that.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.760]   Two more for you really quick on the personal side.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.100]   If you're in a relationship,
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.500]   tell your partner one thing you appreciate
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.660]   about them every single night.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.400]   And this can be the tiniest thing.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.580]   It can be like, I appreciate how you picked up that one thing
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.980]   or how you let me know about X, Y, or Z.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.900]   Just tell them one small thing
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.340]   because as relationships go on,
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.500]   it's really easy to just not think about all the good
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.660]   and to just have the stressful or the tension
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.640]   or the anxiety be the things that you hold in your mind.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.580]   And doing this every night has had a really positive impact
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.180]   on my wife and my relationship.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.980]   And then the last one,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.580]   take yourself out for more meals alone.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.720]   I do this once a month without fail,
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.300]   either a lunch or a dinner, dinner preferably,
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.460]   although probably doesn't happen quite as often now
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.620]   with the little guy,
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.940]   but just go out to a restaurant by yourself.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.140]   It can be your favorite place or it can be a new place.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.540]   Don't bring any technology or just keep it in your pocket,
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.820]   put it on airplane mode.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.620]   You can bring a book, you can bring a notebook
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.360]   if you want to journal and write things,
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.260]   but just sit by yourself
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.660]   and allow yourself to sort of be bored
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.080]   and just observe the world around you
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.700]   and have a nice meal by yourself.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.380]   Huge unlock that not enough people are doing.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.220]   I love this one.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.180]   I'll share one that's similar for people with family
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.180]   and it's if the theme of yours was
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.460]   you don't always have to eat with your partner
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.040]   or with someone else, you can eat by yourself.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.660]   Mine is you don't always have to spend
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.340]   all of your family time with all of your family.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.300]   You mentioned you'd take walks with your son.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.780]   I think that it's important to have quality time as a family
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.540]   and it's also important to have quality time
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.100]   with people in your family together without everyone else.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.020]   So that's for us, I would say,
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.460]   encourage people to find a way to get childcare,
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.420]   to go on a date,
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.400]   even if it's a lunch date in the middle of the day
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.460]   or dinner or something.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.460]   And then also with your kids alone,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.260]   like I take my daughter on an adventure.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.980]   So my wife and I are talking about
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.100]   what we wanna do with our family in the future
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.020]   and taking a trip with each kid without the other kid
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.040]   is something we wanna do.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.500]   And spending time with lots of different
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.740]   like one-on-one stuff is also really important.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.660]   So that's one that I wanna take in 2023.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.340]   All right, last section is money.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.380]   All right, money.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.540]   I just had three in there.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.980]   We can hit them rapid fire.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.500]   First one is automate a direct deposit
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.820]   into an investment account
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.420]   that you basically never look at.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.300]   One should do this.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.620]   This is just like an absolute financial no-brainer.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.300]   Allow the money to just compound.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.780]   Don't think about how much money's in it.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.200]   Just set some low number
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.420]   that feels not super stressful to you
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.140]   that automatically goes out in a direct deposit
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.420]   into this investment account every single month.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.780]   Let compounding work for you.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.300]   Number two, automate all the simple
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.000]   financial tasks in your life.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.700]   I used to be a type of person
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.860]   that would just check all of my different bills
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.300]   and look at all the numbers and pay them all manually
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.540]   'cause I figured someone was gonna be
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.980]   trying to screw me over.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.580]   It never once happened,
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.700]   and I was just wasting a whole bunch of mental energy
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.460]   by going and looking at these things every month.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.940]   So automating all of your bill payment,
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.020]   credit cards, investing, et cetera,
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.760]   anything that's pulling your mind away
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.900]   from things that really matter is easily automatable.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.120]   And then the last one for me
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.180]   is this rule I have around material purchases,
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.020]   which is a way to save money and build wealth.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.020]   Make a 48-hour rule about material purchases,
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.100]   which means if you put something in a shopping cart,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.900]   walk away, and 48 hours later, come back.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.980]   If you still want the thing, buy it,
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.620]   and there's no issue with that.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.420]   But most of the time, you're gonna realize
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.460]   that the material purchase
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.740]   that you'd put in your shopping cart,
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.520]   48 hours later, you've thought about it,
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.560]   and you don't go buy.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.900]   So it's a behavioral hack
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.580]   for avoiding the unnecessary purchases
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.820]   that we don't really need.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.980]   And if you can invest that money instead, even better.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.800]   I like it.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.620]   I do both the first thing and the second thing.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.320]   So I love all the automation.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.940]   I'm not as diligent about putting in your shopping cart,
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.240]   but I'll add mine, which is everyone knows
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.420]   that's listening to this show that has in the past.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.000]   When you're about to check out on something,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.500]   go find all the ways you can save money for it.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.300]   Ask LiveChat for the discount,
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.040]   use Rakuten or some other platform to get cash back,
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.860]   see if you could buy gift cards at a discount,
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.720]   use the right card.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.180]   Obviously, we're all doing those things.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.420]   Especially on miso soup, by the way.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.580]   Yeah, you can save money on that $4.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   I'm gonna add two others.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.700]   One is if you're not already tracking
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.900]   and organizing something in an automated way,
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.760]   do that.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.500]   So I have two or three primary platforms for this.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.140]   So I worked at Wealththread for a while.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:40.980]   People know that.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.100]   They have a free way that you can link all of your accounts,
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.140]   see your net worth all in one place.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.860]   I also use a product called Kubera,
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:50.180]   which is, I would say, if you want the free version,
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.220]   Wealththread does a great job.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.340]   If you want the full bells and whistles pro version,
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.460]   I think Kubera is best in class.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.280]   Tracks all of your accounts across all places.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.500]   It works well with everything from manual assets
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.860]   to crypto to real estate and everything.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.780]   So I think it's a great product.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   And I use Trustworthy for managing all of life's stuff.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.380]   So where are our old tax returns?
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.860]   Where are all of our COVID vaccine cards,
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.900]   our social security cards?
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.700]   I put all of our life stuff there.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.860]   They've built the family operating system.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.100]   There is a price,
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.760]   but when you just think about the overhead you have
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.020]   of trying to manage and find and store all of this stuff,
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.300]   it's not worth it for me.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.460]   So those are two things to just set up some organization
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.660]   for where's your money, what's your net worth,
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.540]   what are all your accounts, all that.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.340]   And then the other is for 2023,
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.460]   this is mostly for people with kids,
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.820]   but knock off the two big tasks
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.020]   that every single parent I know punts on,
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.720]   which is setting up a will or a trust or something like that
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.140]   and setting up life insurance.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.060]   Those two things are things that have been bogging you down.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.140]   Like go get them done in 2023
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.340]   because they're just like so, so, so important.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.740]   That's my recommendation for two things on the money side
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.500]   to bring into the year.
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.660]   I need to check out Kubera.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.740]   This sounds really interesting.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.100]   I've always looked for something like this.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:07.940]   I'm gonna go check it out.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.760]   Awesome.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.700]   Is it an Indian company?
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.520]   'Cause I think it's derived from the God of wealth.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.740]   The founder, I believe has,
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.300]   family is from India or is from India.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.140]   I don't remember.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:17.960]   Okay, cool.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.500]   Yeah, it's a great name 'cause it's the God of wealth.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.620]   So Kubera is awesome.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.080]   By the time this episode comes out,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.220]   they will be a partner of the show
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.580]   and we'll have a discount for you.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.740]   If not, go to allthehacks.com/deals
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.140]   and it should be there.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:28.980]   That's it.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.820]   We covered a lot.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.660]   You say that's it.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   Oh man.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.020]   I think that's it for now actually
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.240]   because you've written all these amazing posts,
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.700]   one on razors, paradoxes,
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.980]   and I was like, we should go through all this.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.580]   And I was trying to plan for this episode
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.820]   and I'm really glad we didn't try to fit all that in here.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.660]   Oh man.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.540]   'Cause we would have just been one of those
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.500]   like run through everything, no depth, no value.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.540]   So I think we gotta have you back on
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.320]   and we can run through a few of the other things
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.500]   you've written about that I think would be
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.260]   really valuable to talk through.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.420]   I would love to do it, man.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.260]   This was a blast.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.540]   It was really fun getting to actually talk
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.380]   through this live.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.200]   I haven't gotten to do this.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.780]   I'm excited to get everyone's feedback
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.780]   and hopefully people come away with a few things
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:03.020]   that changed their life this year.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.860]   I love it.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.240]   One thing that I like to ask everyone,
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.620]   which I paused in the last interview,
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.940]   I don't know why I forgot,
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.180]   was is there a place, whether it's where you're from,
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.660]   where you travel a lot, that you know a lot about,
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.660]   that someone we're going to for a day,
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.380]   you'd tell them here's a place to eat,
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:18.340]   here's a place to have a drink,
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.940]   or here's something unique to do?
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.780]   Yes.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.420]   So in Bangalore, India,
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.660]   which is where my mother's from
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.700]   that I've spent a ton of time in over the years,
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.200]   there is an amazing restaurant at this pretty old hotel,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.320]   which is now called ITC Windsor.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   The restaurant is called the Royal Afghan,
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.480]   and it is my favorite meal in the entire world.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.840]   The best naan that I've ever had,
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.940]   and they have a dish called dal bukhara
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.640]   that is unbelievable.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.320]   So that would be mine, the Royal Afghan in Bangalore, India.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   Anything else you'd say?
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.640]   If someone's going all the way to India,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.080]   they're going to the Royal Afghan,
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.800]   how should they spend the rest of their day?
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.760]   Oh man, just take in the culture.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.920]   If you've never been to India,
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.800]   it is an unbelievable and very different experience.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.840]   The smell will last with you forever.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.280]   It is a very distinct smell
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.920]   when you get off the plane in India.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.640]   Well, I'll add one extra Bangalore recommendation,
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.920]   which is not actually in Bangalore,
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.440]   but if you like to rock climb, hop on the train,
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.920]   which is a whole nother experience,
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.680]   and head to Hampi, which is a really cool place
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.900]   for a ridiculous amount of outdoor bouldering.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.740]   We had a lot of fun there.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.580]   I haven't done that yet.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.180]   I'm going at the end of this month though,
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.280]   so maybe I'll have to go do that.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.120]   Do you rock climb?
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:21.940]   (laughs)
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:22.780]   No.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.400]   I think a backpackery rock climbing town,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.080]   that is what the town is known for,
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.960]   at least for tourism purposes.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.200]   Yeah, I think I'm going to pass on this.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.840]   I'm just going to stick to doing the commercial stuff.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.000]   You can have a lot of fun in Bangalore.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.600]   We had a great time, but awesome.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.220]   All right, thank you so much.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.520]   Where can people sign up for the newsletter,
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.340]   follow you, and stay on top of everything
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.480]   you're writing online?

[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.040]   Definitely worth a follow and a subscribe.

[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.080]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.520]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.880]   questions for me, or just want to say hi,

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.660]   (upbeat music)
