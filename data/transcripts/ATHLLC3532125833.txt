[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.800]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.680]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400]   Now, just a few weeks ago, I read a few posts
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800]   that really had me thinking more
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   about how I wanna optimize 2023.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.240]   One was about conducting a personal annual review,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.200]   and the other was about 23 ways
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   to make 2023 an amazing year.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.160]   They were both fantastic,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.800]   and they were both written by my friend Sahil Bloom,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.960]   who is one of my favorite creators.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.360]   But he actually started his career in private equity
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.120]   and then spent a decade investing professionally
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.160]   before he turned to writing about finance
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.520]   and sharing his frameworks
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.440]   to have a more fulfilling life and career.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.040]   And to prepare for this conversation,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.200]   I actually ended up coming up
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600]   with so many topics I wanted to cover,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520]   but we're gonna have to get to them another time
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.900]   because we're gonna focus today
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.160]   on conducting a personal annual review,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.280]   which is nothing like the arduous process
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.840]   of a performance review at work.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.760]   It's actually just seven questions you can ask yourself
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.440]   that give you the perfect opportunity
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   to reflect on the past year and plan for what's ahead.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   Then we're gonna walk through some of Sahil
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.720]   and my top recommendations
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.400]   for how to make 2023 an amazing year
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.840]   across your work, health, life, and money.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.560]   I'm so excited for this conversation,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.840]   so let's get started right after this.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   Sahil, welcome to the show.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.200]   Thank you for having me, man.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.240]   As an avid listener,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.800]   I'm excited to make my debut appearance here.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   Yeah, and we'll probably get to this at the end,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.520]   but there might be some future appearances coming,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.200]   but it's January.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.360]   There are a lot of people out there
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.900]   trying to make their resolutions,
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.840]   make their intentions for the year.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   What do you think people get wrong
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.120]   when they go through that process?
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.880]   The biggest thing I think people get wrong
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240]   is focus on the planning side
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.920]   and not enough on the reflecting side.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.440]   There's this quote that I love,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.840]   John Dewey, an American philosopher,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.920]   and basically what he said was,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   "We don't learn from experience.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.200]   "We learn from reflecting on experience."
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.960]   And I always thought that was a really powerful way
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.320]   of thinking about your year.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.520]   You get to the end of the year
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760]   and everyone's instinct is,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.880]   "Okay, I'm gonna look forward.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.760]   "Let me make my goals.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.680]   "Let me do all that."
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   And that's just the way everyone operates.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.620]   It's the standard.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.640]   And not enough time is spent reflecting
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.880]   on the year that just passed.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.080]   And what did you learn from it?
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.440]   And how can you actually take those learnings
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000]   and drive yourself forward
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   and do a better year going forward?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's funny, I was hoping you'd say that
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.640]   because I wanted to talk about your personal annual review
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.600]   because I've seen you tweet about it,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.380]   and then you actually produced this document
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.760]   that people could download.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.040]   I kind of want to walk through it.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520]   So do you think we could just give people an overview
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.240]   of how you structure an annual review?
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120]   And then if anyone listening wants a copy,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.320]   we'll definitely link to it in the show notes.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.600]   Yeah, it's a pretty simple structure, as you know there.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.480]   I've been doing this for the last five plus years,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   I would say, in this format.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.880]   And you've had or had discussions
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.800]   with a few of these people,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600]   but I've taken inspiration over the years
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.880]   from a lot of the giants that I really look up to
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.120]   and admire like Tim Ferriss or James Clear,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   who have written about in the past
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.620]   their annual review structures.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.200]   And so I've sort of adapted that,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   but basically the whole thing
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.800]   is framed around seven questions.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   So maybe we can just go through the questions.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680]   You and I can chat about them a little bit.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.960]   I'm curious for what your perspectives are
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.480]   on your own year on these.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.600]   Maybe we can go from there.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.920]   I'm so glad you put this together
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   and that we're having this conversation
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.960]   'cause I went through and I started going through
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.000]   all of this myself.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   And I don't think I would have done that
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840]   without your prompt.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   It's like you jump in and you're like,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   "Oh, I got all this stuff to do this year."
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.300]   So I think this was a great process for me.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.200]   I hope other people take that away from it.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.420]   But let's just jump in, number one.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.400]   So the first one that I always start with
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.680]   is what did I change my mind on this year?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.640]   It's the first question I always ask.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.480]   And the genesis of this is really just this idea
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.400]   that if you're not changing in any way, you're dying.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.560]   Like we need to adapt.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.840]   We need to have those like software updates
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.400]   as I like to think of them to our mind
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   to rewrite the old code and refresh it with new things.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.320]   And so at the end of the year, I always like to ask,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.420]   like what are the big things
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.460]   that I really changed my mind on?
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.920]   And if there's nothing, I start to get really worried.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.600]   That's when the tension starts to build.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   So that's always the first question that I ask.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.040]   I'm curious for you specifically,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.880]   what are some of the things
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   that you feel like you changed your mind on this year?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.800]   And I'm happy to give you mine.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.640]   So I'll run through it,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   but I have one quick question,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.840]   which is for each of these things,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.260]   is there anything you do that helps jog your memory?
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.960]   For me, I was like looking through my photo albums,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.140]   like where was I this year
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.680]   to try to just anchor some points on things?
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.360]   Or I was looking at my work calendar,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.080]   like I was trying to figure out,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.520]   it's not that I didn't change my mind.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.440]   It's like, how do I find the things I changed on
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   without too much recency bias?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.440]   I'm like, what did I change my mind on in December?
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.340]   Part of the value of this whole process
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.840]   is that it requires you to pause
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.040]   and actually look back at your work, writing, projects,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.280]   things that you did during the course of the year,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.780]   because that actually gives you the zoomed out perspective.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.880]   The whole value of doing an annual review like this
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.540]   is really that you're constantly living
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.040]   in a first person view.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.760]   You're zoomed in as far as you can possibly be,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.460]   and this forces you to zoom out.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.720]   You're like a bird flying to 10,000 feet
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   and now observing your full year and being able to do it.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.180]   So for me, I'm a writer.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.640]   That's kind of my primary thing.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.980]   So I can actually go back and look at all of my writing
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.540]   during the course of the year and see, find those trends,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.760]   look at things that I was talking about, thinking about,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.740]   and how those might've morphed or changed.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.720]   For a lot of people, it can be journaling,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.000]   notes that you've left yourself
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.500]   during the course of the year.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.980]   Some people send themselves emails.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.840]   I like doing that a lot from time to time.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.920]   Note documents.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.120]   Sometimes it's just conversations with friends.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.780]   It's also a reason, by the way,
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.100]   why these annual reviews are often really productive
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.260]   to do in a group setting or in a one-on-one setting
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.140]   with another individual that you trust,
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.300]   because it tends to lead to a slightly more active discussion
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.100]   and pushbacks that actually make you think
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.420]   a little bit more deeply
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.860]   and avoid that recency bias that you mentioned.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.400]   For me, for some reason,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.180]   and maybe it's that I live in the Bay Area
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.380]   and there's no seasons, so I don't have this like,
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.740]   what was happening when it was snowing?
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.940]   What was happening during summer?
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.560]   I like to use the calendar
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.600]   and go back and look at calendars and photos
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.120]   to just jog my memory of like, what happened in spring?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.220]   Oh, I went on this trip to New York or Boston or something.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.460]   Oh, what was going on at work around the time I did that?
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.500]   So that was my version.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.980]   I've done that recently, by the way, with my wife.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.840]   So we just had our sixth anniversary
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.300]   and we were on a walk and we started thinking about,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.000]   okay, what did we do each year since we got married?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.660]   Like, what were the big milestones, trips, things we did?
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.020]   And it was such a fun and interesting exercise
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.300]   to think about like, what our mindset was
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.620]   at each of these points in life.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.980]   We got married and then we kind of had,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.100]   you have the honeymoon period
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.140]   and you're going on all these trips
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.740]   and what were you thinking about and doing?
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.820]   It's actually a really fun relationship exercise
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.700]   for people that have been in longer term relationships.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.540]   - I'll share one thing
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.820]   and then I'll promise I'll answer your question,
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.060]   which is starting in, I don't know why, March of 2014,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.900]   I started logging this doc,
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.020]   it's just a Google sheet called Monthly Experiences.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.220]   And my goal was that every month for the rest of my life,
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.260]   I needed to have an experience
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.180]   that made that month memorable.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.860]   I first was like, was it monthly memorables,
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.060]   was monthly experiences?
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.300]   And it didn't necessarily have to be
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.500]   some crazy skydiving kind of thing.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300]   One of them was like, I had surgery on my foot
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.180]   because I had this thing called a Morton's neuroma
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.220]   and it'd been a pain in my life for a long time.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.980]   And finally, I was just like, I'm gonna do this.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.580]   One was, we were in Colorado where my wife grew up
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.500]   and it was like so much snow, it was so cold.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.100]   And I was like, I'm gonna go build an igloo.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.380]   Like get a chainsaw, cut blocks of ice
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.540]   and build an igloo. - Oh man.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.580]   - Things like that.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.980]   June, 2015, we got a dog.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.740]   This was one way, it has nothing to do with an annual review
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.220]   but it was, I wanted to make sure that every month
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.380]   of my life, there was something memorable.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.220]   And I was like, gosh, it really dropped off a cliff
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.540]   when I had kids and the pandemic hit
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.820]   and I need to resume it.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.300]   But it was like, oh, when the pandemic was here
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.940]   and you have kids, yeah, there was something memorable
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.460]   with childhood development each month,
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.700]   but it felt weird to be like, kid smiled, kid said dad.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.660]   Like it was so focused on that.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.300]   So I gotta get it back going,
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.740]   but something to encourage everyone to consider
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.300]   if you're wanting to make sure each month
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.140]   has something exciting about it.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.900]   - I love that idea, it's great.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.540]   - So a few of the things for me was that
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.060]   one was around outsourcing.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.140]   I think I have always been someone in multiple jobs,
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.860]   I've had the opportunity to have an admin
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.700]   and I just always said no, I always said no.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.060]   I was kind of taking everything into my own hands.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.300]   I loved optimizing.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.260]   And finally, last year in 2022, I really started saying,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.300]   okay, maybe I could hire someone to help do some research.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.540]   Maybe I could hire someone to help
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.820]   with parts of the newsletter, with parts of the editing,
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.700]   with parts of the production.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.380]   So last year was a year that I changed my mind
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.700]   on hiring people to help do things,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.140]   to give you more surface area
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.820]   you can cover with your own time.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.180]   So that was one.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.300]   - That's a powerful one.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.100]   That's gonna pay dividends for a long time,
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.260]   changing your mind on that.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.980]   - Yeah, the other one, which I think was the hardest,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.820]   was learning to spend money.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.060]   And I know this sounds crazy,
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.460]   but I feel like myself and maybe a lot of people listening,
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.940]   we almost get to the point of optimizing and frugality,
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.180]   that it's very hard to spend money on anything.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.500]   Like, I remember we're at a Japanese restaurant
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.300]   and I was like, "All I want is a miso soup."
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.500]   Like, that just felt like what I wanted today.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.060]   And I was like, "God, they're charging $7 for a miso soup.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.460]   "I feel like a miso soup should be $3 or $4."
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.540]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.380]   "I just need to stop worrying."
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.500]   Like, I'm so used to telling people,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.660]   "Stop worrying about the latte.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.700]   "It's not about the latte.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.780]   "This is a Ramit Sethi thing."
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.180]   He's like, "The lattes aren't what's killing you.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.380]   "It's these big decisions."
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.660]   And here I am, to use the Japanese restaurant example,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.780]   not ordering a seaweed salad because I like it,
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.140]   because it's extra $5, or not getting miso soup
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.340]   because it's overpriced by $2.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.460]   I found that when you can just let the small decisions go,
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.620]   happiness goes up, stress goes down, anxiety goes down.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.540]   When it comes to optimizing my finances,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.580]   where I am in my life,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.460]   those one, two, three, four, $5 differences
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.700]   weren't having a big impact.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.540]   And so I've changed my mind on that a lot.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.580]   When I'm shopping online for groceries,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.100]   I would pull up Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.260]   and price compare strawberries and stuff like that.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.380]   I've kind of gotten over the small costs of things
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.220]   and gotten comfortable.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.380]   So those are two things.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.260]   And the one small funny thing that I'll share,
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.420]   which I put in my end of the year learnings was mouth tape.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.220]   When I interviewed Liz Moody,
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.540]   who has this Healthier Together podcast,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.020]   she was like, "You should consider trying this out,
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   "taping your mouth at night."
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.900]   And I was like, "That is the craziest thing."
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.900]   For six months, I was like, "That's the craziest thing."
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.740]   And then I was like, "You know what?
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.820]   "I'm just gonna try it."
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.860]   And it was awesome.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.020]   - Changed your life?
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.580]   Were you a big mouth breather before?
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.140]   - It wasn't a thing that I processed in my mind,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.380]   but there were just times where I woke up
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.780]   and my mouth was a little dry.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.820]   And I was like, "Oh, I wonder
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.500]   "if I'm a really heavy mouth breather now."
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.460]   And then I tried it and I was like, "I woke up
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.420]   "and it just felt like my mouth was fresh."
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.580]   I know it sounds like a weird thing to say.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.780]   - Well, it's deeply impactful for your health.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.860]   Breathing through your nose.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.740]   You should have James Nestor on at some point.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.580]   He wrote the Bible on this.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.420]   - Breathe.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.460]   We've been going back and forth.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.260]   - You should have him on and do an episode on breathing
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.940]   'cause it's hugely impactful for your health.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.980]   - So that was one where you write it off
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.920]   as like, "That's so silly.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.760]   "Why would you do that?
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.700]   "That seems ridiculous."
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.260]   And last year I was like, "You know what?
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.100]   "Let's just try it."
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.140]   And now I have like a stack of hostage tape,
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.540]   which is like the most ridiculous name
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.340]   for a mouth tape company on my bedside.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.740]   - There is a general rule of thumb there, by the way.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.780]   And maybe it's like a David Foster Wallace,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.020]   "This is water" takeaway as well of,
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.140]   anytime your bias is, "That's totally ridiculous.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.220]   "That sounds silly.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.420]   "That's wild."
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.460]   Just try it.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.540]   Because half the time, those things
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.820]   that you're automatically highly certain of,
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.980]   you end up being completely wrong on.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.780]   And maybe we would all learn a whole lot more
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.580]   about ourselves and grow in a different way
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.020]   if we just took on those things
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.940]   that we write off immediately.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.620]   - Anything from your list this past year
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.460]   that's worth sharing?
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.300]   - The biggest one for me was a kid thing.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.780]   I think you know this, but we had our first son in May.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.500]   He was born and I had these like grand ambition
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.820]   prior to him being born
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.820]   of all the things I was gonna teach him.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.020]   Like I had this long list that I had written out
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.220]   of all the stuff I was gonna teach my son
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.220]   and how I was gonna mold his personality
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.500]   in all these different ways.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.020]   And I think somewhere around like the six month mark,
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.380]   which was later in the year,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.580]   I just realized that I don't think it's possible.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.380]   I basically think that kids come out with a sort of a kit
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.500]   and their personality and who they are
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.020]   and aspects of their character.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   It's sort of fixed.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.840]   It's like genetic.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.820]   They come out with it.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.020]   And our job is actually not to try to teach them things
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.680]   around all of these specific values that we want.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's to be able to embody our values as a person
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   and hopefully guide them in the general direction
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.220]   of what we believe is a strong set of values.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.780]   But the idea of like being able to mold and shape my child,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.200]   I've given up on as something that's possible.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.440]   - It's funny 'cause just this morning,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.280]   I had a moment that further re-emphasized this for me,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.880]   which was there were these three little felt balls
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.360]   and my daughter was playing with them.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.480]   And she's like, "Daddy, here you go."
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.960]   And she just hands them to me and I start juggling them.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.740]   And she's like mesmerized.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.760]   She's two and a half.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.800]   She's obviously too young to learn to juggle right now.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.600]   I'm sure there's some savant kid in the world
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.720]   who can juggle a two and a half,
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.040]   but that didn't seem impossible today.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   - A Rubik's cube probably solving it.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.760]   - But I was thinking, gosh, I bet if I went to her
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.740]   and was like, "Hey, let me teach you how to juggle."
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.940]   She'd be like, "No, I wanna do things on my own."
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.800]   But just doing it.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.840]   Like if you want your child to maybe do something
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.360]   that you do or learn something,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.080]   letting them emulate you and watch you
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.680]   and maybe admire and look up to it
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.480]   is probably gonna be a 10 times more effective way to do it
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   than trying to force them to learn this thing
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.720]   that you want them to learn.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.600]   - Completely agree.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.680]   That's why I bring my son with me in my garage gym
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   so that he can watch me work out.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.640]   - He's like seven months old.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.660]   He's like, "I'm gonna do that one day."
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.840]   - Awesome, okay.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.040]   Question two.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.880]   - Let's do it.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.200]   - All right, so the second question and the third
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.520]   are all around energy.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.960]   And the second question is basically
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.320]   what created energy for you during the course of the year?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.880]   This whole idea is to go back and look at your calendars.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.720]   You said you were already doing this for the first one,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.200]   but go back and look at your calendars from the year
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.760]   and try to identify the trends
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.960]   in what actually created energy in your life.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.280]   What were the activities?
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.920]   What were the work projects?
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.880]   What were the meetings?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.240]   Who were the people?
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.120]   What were these trends that actually brought you energy?
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.000]   - So this was a fun one.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I guess people listening to this
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.880]   are probably not gonna pause and go do one
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.080]   before finishing the episode,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   so they won't have this problem.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.200]   But I would definitely encourage people to listen
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.920]   or read all of the topics of the personal review
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.760]   and then go back and look at your calendar.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.040]   Otherwise, you'd go back,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.480]   learn a bunch of things you changed your mind on
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.680]   and then have to repeat the process.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.840]   So this was really interesting
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.480]   because I think this past year was the first year
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.960]   that the world opened up and I was a creator.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.840]   And I met a bunch of other people,
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.440]   creating podcasts, YouTube, all kinds of stuff.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.320]   That's just never been a part of my career.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.280]   I met a lot of founders and investors
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.320]   and people in finance and financial advisors and planners,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.760]   but I'd never really met a lot of creators.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   And that was one thing that gave me a lot of energy
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.320]   because this is my new job
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.880]   but I just have never been in this industry.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.800]   So that was a big one for me.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.160]   And then going on adventures with my daughter,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.760]   just me and her, and we have two now,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.120]   but we would ride our bike.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.040]   I'd put her on the back.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.880]   We'd ride the bike.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.160]   We'd hop on Caltrain.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.440]   We'd ride like two stops on Caltrain.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.360]   We'd get off.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.680]   We'd go to the donut shop.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.800]   We'd like buy a donut.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.400]   And then we'd like bike back home.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.240]   - That's so awesome.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.320]   - It's like those adventures were so much fun.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   I have a bunch of other ones,
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.640]   but those are two I'll share.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.200]   - And then the question to ask yourself,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.920]   by the way, after you identify those activities,
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.840]   those people, the projects,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.880]   is really, did I spend enough time on those?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.720]   Go look at it.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.520]   Was that like 2% of my time spent?
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.400]   And I was actually just spending the rest of my time
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.240]   on other stuff?
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.280]   Because that's a question that you then need to answer
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.440]   as you think about what your next year looks like.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.120]   So for me, I probably have a somewhat similar one to you
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.520]   in that I get a ton of energy out of creative activities.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.600]   And that's writing for me is a huge one.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.160]   Conversations with smart, interesting people is another one.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.440]   Extremely broadly, by the way,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.880]   this isn't like talking to successful people
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   is what I get excited about.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.960]   I have fascinating conversations with Uber drivers,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.320]   with people that are helping me
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.400]   with things around the house.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.720]   I find that you can learn from almost anybody
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.400]   when you open up to it.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.600]   And I get a ton of energy
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   from hearing different people's stories,
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.480]   different people's struggles.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.080]   It ends up inspiring a lot of the things
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.040]   that I end up writing about as well.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   So that's a huge energy creator for me.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.280]   And then the last one is sort of productive leisure
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.360]   as a category.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.280]   And I think about it, walking is a huge one for me.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.720]   I probably averaged close to 20,000 steps a day in 2022,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.960]   which was a huge number for me
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   relative to anything I had done in the past,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.320]   largely because my son would only sleep
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.000]   when he was taking on walks outside.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.680]   And so it forced me to be outside a lot.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.760]   And I just found that I was getting so much creative energy
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.600]   from walking and being out in nature.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.480]   So that was another big learning for me.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.200]   - To compliment that with what drained energy
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   is the next one, right?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.880]   - Yeah, and it goes in tandem.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.600]   As we said, when you look at your calendar,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.800]   you're figuring out what were the things
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.640]   that created energy.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.920]   And then you're looking at the same time
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.400]   at what was the stuff that just drained me.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.440]   For a lot of people, this tends to be stuff
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.160]   like back-to-back meetings, phone calls,
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   the meetings to talk about future meetings,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.760]   processing email, doing things
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.320]   that are sort of monotonous activities
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.200]   that happen to hijack your day a lot of the time.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.120]   So figuring out what those activities are,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.520]   what the trends are in them,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.040]   and then figuring out if you allowed those
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.320]   to take over your entire day,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.920]   or if you were able to sort of manage the balance
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.600]   that has to naturally exist across the energy creators
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.360]   and the energy drainers.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.440]   - Funny enough, I think I took this
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.240]   in a slightly different perspective,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.720]   which was it wasn't the back-to-back meetings, all that stuff.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.520]   There were two things that I put here that I'll share.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.760]   One was fitting our children into our old life.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.120]   So my wife and I probably clocked in four, five, six,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   seven trips a year when we were kidless pre-pandemic.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.600]   Whether they were weekend trips or drives
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.640]   or international trip.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.560]   And I think we had a great time in December
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.640]   going to London and Paris with two kids.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.560]   But I think trying to fit two small kids
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.000]   into the type of trip we would normally take
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.760]   actually drained a lot of energy.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.280]   And I think we probably would have been better off
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.640]   trying to think about the trip,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.680]   not from a how do we get the best of both worlds,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   but how do we maybe have one trip a year
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.000]   where we can get away on our own,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.680]   and one trip where we're taking it in a way
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.600]   that doesn't require as much effort and burden.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.960]   Especially when kids are napping one, two, three times a day.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.880]   It's just you're not gonna have that same experience.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.320]   So that was one.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.560]   And the other one was social media,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.920]   just feeling the need to put pressure to,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.360]   oh, I gotta post this much, this many places.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.280]   I was like, I found the content area that I love right now,
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.240]   which is recording a podcast, writing a newsletter.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.040]   I really love those two things.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.880]   But it drained me every time I was thinking,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.960]   oh, how do I clip it to a short form video
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.000]   and post it here and here?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.280]   We'll get to this later 'cause I have some other thoughts,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.960]   but that was one where I think it just drained, it drained.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.760]   Just trying to think about those things.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.640]   - Yeah, that one drains a lot of people
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.360]   in the creator ecosystem.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.240]   You can spread yourself way too thin
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   across all of these different platforms
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.480]   and get a lot of FOMO about like,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.040]   oh, it's growing their podcast a lot by doing this and this.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.560]   On that platform, it's just, oh, I need to be doing that.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.720]   And it just like pulls you in that direction mentally,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.840]   and the cognitive load ends up being, it destroys you.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.240]   Anything that drained you?
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.880]   - The biggest one for me is always calls and meetings.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.760]   Calls and Zoom meetings, I should say.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.240]   I love in-person meetings.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.760]   And so my big takeaway was calls,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.720]   like the get-to-know-you calls,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.240]   I'm just not doing anymore.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.440]   We're just not gonna do those.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.600]   My way to make sure that I still have
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.160]   those get-to-know-you things is doing them in person.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.000]   And basically, I'm an open book
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.320]   of meeting people in person in New York.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.800]   And New York, fortunately, tends to be one of the places
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.920]   that basically everyone comes through
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.200]   at some point or another.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.400]   And so if someone reaches out to me
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.080]   and they live in Vancouver and they wanna get together,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.360]   and I'm not doing calls
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.480]   'cause I'm not gonna do a get-to-know-you call,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.080]   they tend to be coming to New York
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.480]   at some point within the next six months,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.880]   and we will get together in person and meet that way.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.640]   And it's been awesome so far
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.320]   since I started implementing the change.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.360]   Just the energy of meeting someone in person,
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.600]   the friendships that get formed,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.760]   it's just on a different level
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.360]   from the Zoom call that you end up leaving and saying,
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.680]   hey, we should get drinks sometime,
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.040]   and you end up never connecting
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.280]   with the person in the future.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.240]   That, for me, is definitely number one going into this year.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.080]   - Going into this year,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.680]   the other thing I'm gonna do on that point is,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.180]   if someone says, can we do a meeting?
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.000]   I'm just like, can we just do the phone call?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.340]   Not every video call has to be a video call.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.480]   If this wasn't a video call,
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.920]   I feel like maybe we wouldn't connect as well.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.280]   But when we had a quick conversation before this,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.000]   we did it on the phone and it was fun.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.320]   - And you can do phone calls while walking, by the way.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.640]   Huge unlock for me is just,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.960]   I'll do phone calls while walking now when I need to.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   And it's a big unlock.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.160]   You actually think more clearly
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   when you're walking that way.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.640]   Unless you need to be in front of your computer
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.200]   for a specific reason, walking meetings are awesome.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.840]   - And if someone pushes back,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.300]   if you wanna prevent the pushback,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.700]   they're like, hey, let's do a video call.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.800]   I say, hey, you know what?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.760]   I find that when I'm doing a call on my computer,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.200]   I'm a bit more distracted 'cause there's email popping up.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.440]   So maybe we do a phone call and I'll just go on a walk
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.220]   and I'll be completely focused on you.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.600]   How's someone gonna push back there?
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.200]   You're like, do you want my attention
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.040]   or do you want part of it?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.880]   - And it's 100% accurate, by the way.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.880]   Think about how many windows you typically have up
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.240]   during a typical Zoom call
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   and how often you're checking the notifications
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.160]   that pop up in the screen or looking at the internet
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.400]   or your email or whatever it is.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.580]   It's totally true.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.040]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.880]   I get it.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.560]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.440]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.520]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.480]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.400]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.360]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.120]   take care of the supplies.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.940]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.800]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.200]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.180]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.660]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.720]   that you got through another week.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.840]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.160]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.240]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.920]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.480]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.440]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.480]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.320]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.360]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.020]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.480]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.140]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.440]   download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.680]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.020]   With travel back on the calendar
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.420]   and my kid in preschool,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.400]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.840]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.680]   which is why I kickstart my day
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.760]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.480]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.360]   for this episode.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.900]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.640]   because I think it's the best option
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.520]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.260]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.960]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.280]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.240]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.720]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.880]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.920]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.440]   and energized for the day,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.960]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.720]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.760]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.600]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.480]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.960]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.840]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.160]   to take ownership over your health
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.640]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.320]   Okay, question four.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.640]   This is one of my favorites.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   What or who were the boat anchors in my life?
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.040]   And boat anchors is a term that I created,
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   so I need to explain it.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.240]   As you would expect,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.880]   it is the thing that is creating drag on your life.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.040]   When I think about boat anchors,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.000]   I typically think about them as people,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.240]   and these are the people that are trying to hold you back.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.120]   It's the people that sort of snicker or laugh
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.480]   when you tell them what your ambitions are.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.640]   It's the people who put down your accomplishments
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.800]   or try to say that they're not as impressive
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.640]   as they otherwise were.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.080]   It's also the people who are saying that about others
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   when you're talking to them,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.440]   and they're putting down others
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.840]   just in the general context of conversation.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.920]   These are boat anchors.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   These are people that are literally placing a drag
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.360]   on your progress and holding you back from achieving
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.040]   at the next level that you're trying to get to.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.120]   So identifying who they are,
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.360]   sitting down and reflecting on the relationships
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.600]   and the things in your life
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.680]   that might be holding you back in that way
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.760]   is a huge part of this reflection process
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.040]   because developing a plan to start minimizing the impact
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.800]   that those people have in your life is really key.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.840]   For the sake of not being boat anchors ourselves,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.240]   I would say let's just skip through
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.320]   trying to talk about who these are in our lives,
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.160]   not be negative,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.600]   but I do think this is a productive step.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.880]   We all have these people.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.480]   And so it's just being really clear.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.760]   We don't need to talk about who ours are,
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.360]   but we all have these people in our lives
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.400]   and thinking about it clearly
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.240]   and sitting down and really reflecting on it.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.280]   And it doesn't have to be that you tell the person,
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.800]   "Hey, you're cut out of my life, by the way."
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.960]   This is an important point.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.120]   You can identify these people
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.560]   and just slowly minimize their role within your ecosystem.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   You don't need to hang out with them all the time.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.080]   Maybe you don't need to touch base with them
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.960]   quite as much as you did,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   or tell them about the things that you're working on
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.840]   or thinking about.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.400]   It's just figuring out a way to minimize the impact
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.560]   of their drag in your life.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   All right, question five.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.480]   What did I not do because of fear?
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.200]   So this goes back to Tim Ferriss,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.440]   who developed, I think it was in 4-Hour Workweek,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.360]   the first time he talked about it,
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.040]   but then there's a very famous TED talk
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.840]   where he talks about it, fear-setting,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.720]   which is generally the idea
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.400]   that we allow our fears to distort our reality
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.960]   and we build them up in our minds
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.440]   as much worse than they really are.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.160]   And so the concept of fear-setting
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.000]   is to get much closer to your fears,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.160]   to really deconstruct them and figure out,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.800]   were they as bad as I thought?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.360]   And what's the worst case that could happen?
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.760]   What's the upside if I actually go and do this
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.960]   and then proceed accordingly?
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.240]   So the whole idea is to go back and look at your year
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.400]   and figure out, what did you actually shy away from doing?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.120]   And then think about, okay,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.720]   well, let me break that fear down.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.040]   How real was it?
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.880]   Because at the time,
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.840]   you just passed on the opportunity due to that fear.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.120]   For me, this was just going full-time on all the hacks.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.880]   And it was so funny because a friend of mine,
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.920]   shout out to Ben who worked with me at Wealthfront,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.680]   who was like, why aren't you doing this?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.560]   Like, why aren't you going full-time on this project?
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.680]   And I was like, well, if I were giving my friend advice,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.600]   I would tell them that they need to go full-time on it.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.240]   Like, it was so obvious.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.640]   I could use all the mindset tactics
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.720]   that I've learned from interviewing smart people
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.120]   where it's like, oh, what would your friend say?
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.240]   If your friend says you should do it,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.400]   then maybe you should take the advice.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.040]   And I was like, well, I would give everyone advice.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.920]   Like, you're at this point
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.160]   where this is the time to capitalize.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   And I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.160]   Part of it was like,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.760]   oh, maybe I'll wait till the end of the year.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.680]   Maybe I'll wait here
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.040]   and I'm on parental leave and all this stuff.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.320]   And I'm happy that I did it,
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.440]   but I spent a decent amount of time
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.920]   trying to figure out why it took me so long.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.680]   That was one that I just needed to break down
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.200]   and spend more time reflecting on.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.760]   - The waiting for the perfect moment
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.880]   is the bias here that almost everyone has.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.440]   We tell ourselves we're gonna do X at the perfect moment,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.000]   and it's not the perfect moment now.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.480]   And the reality is it's never the perfect moment
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.920]   to make those big leaps and to do those big jumps.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.760]   I've written about this.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.800]   Sometimes you literally just need to open the door
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.160]   and jump out and hope the parachute was packed tight
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.800]   and just make that leap.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.120]   And so deconstructing your fears
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.520]   and going through this exercise is really helpful.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   I had the same one, by the way,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.640]   when I was thinking about making the leap
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.680]   to full-time into these personal pursuits a year earlier.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.720]   So in 2021, that was my thing that I held off on doing
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.800]   because of fear that ultimately sort of got forced upon me.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.120]   But that was definitely mine in 2021.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.840]   - The other one is, and I still have this fear,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.280]   all of the businesses I've run
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.400]   have been venture capital-backed businesses
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.800]   where all the money you have as a company,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.160]   it's not like you get to keep it.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.520]   Basically, it's always in the company.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   So you're really motivated to spend it all
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.640]   to try to grow and build a really big company
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.280]   because the benefits to you only come
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.000]   if that company really succeeds.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.320]   When you run a small business,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.440]   which I'll call a podcast a small business,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   it's like if that podcast makes money, you get the money.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.040]   That's how businesses that you own yourselves
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.240]   and you don't have investors work.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.600]   And so one thing that I'm struggling with
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.160]   is to take that money and go reinvest it
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.400]   into the business, if you will.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.600]   Hiring someone to help research or book guests
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.920]   or edit and produce.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.640]   And I feel like I've been able to chip away
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   at smaller pieces, but making a big investment
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.680]   is something that I haven't been able to do yet.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.160]   And I see all these stories of successful business owners,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.440]   not the venture capital startup founder kind of people,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.680]   but the overwhelming theme is that they all reinvested
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.200]   in their business to grow it.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.720]   And so it's like, I know I need to do it.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.560]   I know I should do it.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.440]   I would give my friends advice to do it,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.800]   but it's so hard when it's basically
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.760]   like reinvesting your own money.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.240]   And I think the mindset shift that I had
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.640]   that was so productive for personal savings
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   was that every dollar I earned,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.200]   I just immediately shelved in my brain
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.840]   as if it was my savings.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.720]   So I know a lot of people, the way they budget
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.680]   or the way they spend money, they spend their money,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.440]   but everything that's leftover, they save
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.880]   or they save 500 bucks a month
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.680]   and everything else they can spend.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.400]   For me, 100% of the money was savings.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.640]   And I treated every single purchase as if I was saying,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   do I want to dip into my savings to buy this coffee?
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.360]   Do I want to dip into my savings to have dinner out?
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.880]   That was my process, which made me incredibly frugal,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.720]   probably not spend enough money and do enough things.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.920]   Now, I have that same thing applied to business
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.000]   where it's like, do I want to dip into my savings
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.600]   to hire someone to do this thing?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.760]   And it just makes it harder to spend money.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.720]   That's interesting.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.400]   I kind of did a structural thing from a business standpoint
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.960]   that might be useful for people
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.320]   that has been sort of a behavioral hack for me,
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.680]   which is I have an S-corp that's set up
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.640]   that has all of my kind of personal holding company
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.560]   entities running through it.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.480]   And all I do is with an S-corp,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.080]   you have to pay yourself a salary,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.280]   a reasonable salary out of it.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.800]   And so that reasonable salary is what
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.400]   covers all of our home expenses and our whole life
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.360]   and everything there.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.960]   And so because of that, because it's two separate businesses,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.640]   it runs from my S-corp that pays a salary out
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.400]   to our personal joint bank account as a family.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.760]   I then just think of that S-corp bank account
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.160]   as it's the business, it's the working capital.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   And so everything there, in my mind,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.720]   is segmented as totally separate.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.240]   I need to think about reinvesting.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.960]   What does it look like?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.120]   What's the margin profile?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.440]   What's the return on this investment, et cetera?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   And that's been a hugely helpful behavioral hack for me overall.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.000]   So I just did my S-corp election at the end of the year.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.520]   Smart man.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.240]   So this is something that maybe will make it easier next year.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.320]   Yeah, it definitely will.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.160]   It definitely will.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.200]   The salary thing definitely makes a big difference
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.280]   versus the LLC.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.240]   Six, ready?
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:35.740]   Yep.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.800]   Greatest hits and worst misses from the year.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.440]   The reason for doing this one is because we are all
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600]   swayed by our natural bias.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.280]   So a optimist will see all the hits from the year.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.640]   They'll look at their year and pat themselves on the back
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.000]   and say, wow, I had a great year.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.080]   Look, this and this.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.440]   And the pessimist stares at their year
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.760]   and says, oh my god, this was the worst.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.120]   I had all these things go wrong.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.200]   It was awful.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.680]   Doing a actual explicit list of your hits and your misses
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.800]   forces you to be balanced and actually take
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.680]   a real look at the two sides of your life and success
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.160]   from a scoreboard standpoint.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.120]   So writing them all down, I find, is hugely helpful.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.720]   Which side do you skew on?
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.160]   I would say I skew towards being self-critical.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.920]   I am-- it probably comes from my athletic background.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.560]   Negative self-talk was always how I motivated myself
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.880]   athletically, which is a funny thing to say these days
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.240]   because everyone is very big on positive self-talk.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.440]   I always motivated myself by telling myself
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.360]   it wasn't good enough or the things I was doing
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.160]   wasn't good enough.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.440]   And as a result, if I sit down and think about my year,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.360]   I tend to just glaze over the awesome things that happened
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   and think about, oh, well, this didn't work out
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.080]   or I failed at this, quit this too early, whatever.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.960]   And so it helps for me to zoom out and actually
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.040]   think about the wins to balance all of that out.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.720]   What about you?
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.120]   When it comes to the future, I'm definitely in the optimist camp.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.200]   I'm like, it's always going to work out.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.960]   Kids are going to not even have jet lag when we travel.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.440]   I'm always the one like, what's the brightest side of things?
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.480]   But when it comes to myself, I am always
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.920]   the person that's trying to find how to improve, at least
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.400]   crave the criticism.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   So if I'm cooking dinner for family
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.560]   and everyone's like, this is great, I'm like, sure.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.040]   It's great.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.880]   What wasn't great?
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.400]   Yeah, like, what could have--
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.680]   did it need a little more salt?
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.940]   Could I have cooked it a little longer?
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.480]   I know that I'm not Thomas Kell--
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.320]   I'm not a three Michelin star chef.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.240]   So telling me that this is fantastic,
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.780]   I want to know how to make it better.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.280]   It's weird.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.980]   Forward looking, I'm much better at thinking optimistically.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.640]   On myself and reflection, I'm more like, oh, god,
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.920]   I could have done this better.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.640]   I definitely don't want honest feedback
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.920]   on my cooking from my family.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.400]   Like, if I make steaks on the grill,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.160]   I just want everyone to say, these are amazing.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.840]   That's so funny.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.160]   When everyone says these are amazing around our table,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.280]   I get so frustrated.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.200]   I'm like, no.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.120]   There's no way that this is a perfect steak.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:46.840]   What could have been better?
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.040]   Well, you're going to end up accelerating as a chef,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.640]   and I'm going to kind of stay at my low baseline.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.200]   That's OK.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.120]   I probably shouldn't focus on my cooking as much.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.680]   I'm clearly not going to have a profession in the culinary arts.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.760]   That's a good one, though.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.320]   OK, final question.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.240]   What did I learn this year?
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.880]   This is just the best place to wrap these up for me,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.240]   because it sort of captures everything.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.000]   You just did all of these questions.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.440]   You sort of boil it all down and sit down and write down
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.280]   a list of the things that you learned.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.320]   And how did you grow?
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.040]   And how did you learn?
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.240]   And how did you develop during the course of the year?
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.920]   So I always find this to be a great way
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.680]   to kind of summarize the whole exercise
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.080]   and really have a set of key takeaways.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.680]   So I did this one wrong.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.960]   So I'm going to share my failed experience.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.080]   What did you do wrong?
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.480]   I took it way too literally.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.280]   And I was like, what did I learn?
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.760]   And I was like, oh, well, Nick Gray
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.600]   taught me how to throw a good cocktail party.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.560]   That totally counts.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.520]   I think that's great.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.000]   Sure.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.560]   OK, so maybe I didn't take it wrong.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.240]   But what I didn't do was, what did
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.920]   I learn from going through questions one through six?
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.440]   I didn't do the tie it all up in a bow summary
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.920]   version of number seven.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.880]   I did the, here are all the things I learned.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.000]   And I was like, wow, I could just go to every podcast.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   I learned a bunch of stuff each episode.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.160]   I just had this massive list of all these things I learned.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.800]   What would have been maybe more effective, which I will
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.680]   probably do this afternoon or this evening,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.920]   is let's take the previous six questions
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.080]   in this entire process and try to put a bow on the whole thing
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.680]   and what I learned and what that means for life ahead.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.840]   Yeah, I think both are productive, to be honest.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.560]   I love the fact that you went and learned
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.640]   how to throw a good cocktail party from Nick Gray, who's
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.960]   awesome and best in class at throwing cocktail parties.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.000]   He threw an in-person event for Sam Parr and I
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.080]   that we hosted in New York this summer.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.000]   And I've never seen something so well-coordinated
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   and organized.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.120]   It was amazing.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.960]   That guy is world class.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.080]   So that's a great one.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.040]   I love that one.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.760]   Obviously, we're talking about reflection.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.360]   But I want to talk a little bit about the year ahead.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.000]   But I do want to ask, you mentioned very briefly
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.120]   at the beginning things that made it easy for you
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.720]   to go back, like journaling or sending yourself emails.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.520]   Are there things that people should
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.880]   be thinking about in the year ahead
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.160]   that will make this process easier in the future,
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.520]   whether it's a monthly review or journaling, things like that?
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.680]   Yeah, I do a monthly review that I think is super important.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.280]   And I do this for a number of reasons.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.040]   The biggest one for me is when you
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.960]   have a plan for the year, which if you're
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.680]   listening to this podcast, you're probably a planner.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.000]   You probably like to set your course for the year
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.840]   at the beginning and figure out where you're heading,
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.120]   your North Star, if you will.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.040]   But the biggest challenge with that is a year
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.520]   is just such a long time.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.080]   And changing, you get the whole one in 60 rule
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   that I think was in Atomic Habits is if you're off by one
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.840]   degree, you're going to miss your target by a mile
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.160]   for every 60 miles flown.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.760]   And it's super, super impactful.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.280]   And I think about it a lot.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.240]   So I sit down at the end of every month.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.680]   And I try to ask myself a set of questions
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.080]   and just reflect on the month from the past.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.400]   What were the really important things in my life?
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.800]   Was I focusing on those?
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.280]   Did I actually spend time on the really important things?
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.400]   Or was my attention grabbed elsewhere?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.200]   Are my daily systems, the things that I'm
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.080]   doing on a daily basis, actually in line and aligned
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.160]   with what my long-term goals are, my mid-term goals are?
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.960]   So I do sit down at the end of every month
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.160]   and try to either--
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.280]   for me personally, I like to write down by hand.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.880]   Some people like using Notion or some digital tool
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.360]   or sending themselves an email.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.120]   But for me, being able to have that then as a record
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.760]   that I can go back and look at, in addition to anything else
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.200]   I've collected from the year, like calendars, et cetera,
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.280]   tends to be a really helpful exercise.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.520]   You've published, I think, somewhere that monthly review
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.040]   process.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.520]   Is that right?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.920]   Can we link-- we can link to that.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.760]   Yeah, I released an annual planning guide
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.400]   after the annual review guide, which
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.200]   has my whole process for setting out the long-term goals.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.640]   I think about checkpoint goals that
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.360]   are in between the daily systems that come there,
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.520]   the anti-goals, what we want to avoid, the Pyrrhic victory,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   like avoid winning the battle but losing
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.600]   the war with these goals.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.200]   And then finally, how to think about tracking and adjusting,
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   which is really that monthly review process.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.720]   So I did have that out somewhere and people can find that.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.840]   We can put it in the show notes.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.320]   Perfect.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.440]   And journaling is something that I haven't adopted as a habit,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.080]   but it seems like the data out there
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.640]   is like it's a really good habit.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.680]   It seems like everybody should be doing this.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.800]   It's the best habit.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.200]   I finally figured out how to do this.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.400]   I spent five years-- to be honest, like five years--
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.360]   telling myself at the beginning of every year
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.680]   that I was going to become a journaler because of the impact
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.080]   that it has on your mental health and your ability
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.560]   to change course and reflect.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.920]   And literally, I would come into the year--
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.760]   every year, I'd say I was going to do it.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.040]   I would set up this complex journaling process
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.600]   with these fancy notebooks and these pens and all this stuff
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.280]   because that's just how I'm wired--
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.560]   and set aside 30 minutes a night to sit down and reflect
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   and do all this stuff.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.480]   And without fail, five days in, I would miss a day,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.320]   and then the whole thing would get derailed,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   and I wouldn't journal for the rest of the year.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.640]   And so I finally made progress and figured out
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.840]   a system that works by just simplifying it
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.240]   to a two-minute process where I just do--
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.120]   I call it my 1-1-1 method.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.640]   And it's one win from the day, so one thing that went well
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.600]   that you did well, one point of tension, anxiety, stress,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   like one thing that's just on your chest
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.560]   that you need to get off and get down on paper,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.060]   and then one point of gratitude.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.320]   It can be as tiny as a smell that you really
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.720]   enjoy during the day, or it can be
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.200]   huge-- the health of your family, whatever it might be.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.080]   But writing those three points down every single night,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.800]   it has just been this enormous unlock for my life.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   And it's so simple that literally anyone can do it,
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.060]   and you don't have an excuse not to,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.560]   because it can take one minute to go and sit down and write
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.060]   it.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.520]   And if you are struggling on one of those three things,
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.240]   do you sit there and think it out, or do you just skip it?
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.820]   Or what advice would you give to someone who's like,
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.400]   God, I just can't think of something?
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.480]   I try to do it from complete word-dump mindset.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.280]   I don't want to overthink it too much.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   I want to just do the first thing that comes to my mind,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.240]   the first win that I can think of from the day.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   It can be as simple as, I got up at the time
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.680]   I said I was going to get up.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.800]   Because it just gives you a nice pat on the back,
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.480]   where if you feel like you lost the day,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.920]   you feel like you had a tough day,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.540]   that first win that comes to your mind,
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.120]   and you can write it down, it's so impactful.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.360]   And everyone has tension or stress.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.160]   No one is ever going to be without one
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.240]   of those from a given day.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.480]   You always had something.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.840]   So it tends to be either the win or the point of gratitude
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.600]   is tougher.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.640]   The win is usually the hardest for people.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.680]   Open up the aperture of what qualifies
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.600]   as a win in your life, if you will.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.920]   Everyone thinks it has to be some amazing big thing,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.480]   but it can be as tiny as, I got up out of bed when I thought.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.920]   I took a shower in the way that I wanted to.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.840]   The smallest little thing can count as a win in your life.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.000]   Last night, I had an apple instead of dessert.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.840]   And for anyone who--
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.720]   Help, God.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.760]   That's how I felt. It's that meme where you're like,
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   oh, I felt like a hero.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.360]   And I recorded an episode yesterday
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.840]   with Jordan Schlane, who's a doctor, and he's awesome.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.160]   And we talked a lot about this.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.880]   So I think that episode will have already come out
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.080]   by the time people hear this.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.800]   So you'll know why I was so excited about eating an apple.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.240]   But that would have been my win if I had written that down.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.000]   It's a great one.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.320]   Do you write it digitally or do you write it with a pen?
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.560]   I write with pen and paper.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.720]   I just find the process of actually writing on paper
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.320]   to be pretty therapeutic.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.640]   I have terrible penmanship.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.920]   I need to get much better about that.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.800]   Actually, when I tweeted this whole method out,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.080]   I tweeted a picture of my journal
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.640]   and got dunked on by a bunch of people
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.880]   for how bad my handwriting is.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.400]   But such is life.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.000]   So that's one thing to take into 2023.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.760]   But I know you wrote a post that I really liked, or a newsletter.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.680]   You've been very good at, here's my content.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.920]   If you want to consume it on Twitter,
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   you can consume it here.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.880]   You want to consume it on Instagram,
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.720]   you can consume it here.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.040]   Or you can subscribe to the newsletter, which I do.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.320]   And one was about 23 things to take into 2023.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.760]   So I thought we would wrap this up and go through highlights.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.240]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.040]   Subscribe to the newsletter for sure.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.160]   But just a few of these things, since you broke them down
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.600]   into categories, what do you think?
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.240]   OK.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.000]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.800]   All right, so your first category was work.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.880]   I'll let you hit on a few, your favorites.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.000]   If unprompted, great.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.720]   And if not, I'll prompt you with a couple
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.160]   that I think are worth bringing up.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.760]   OK.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.120]   Well, the first one connects directly to the annual review.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.480]   So I think it's a great one to start on,
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.960]   because it'll help people as they
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   think about this coming year.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.120]   I call this my energy calendar technique.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.360]   It sounds like something from like Sedona, Arizona
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.640]   with crystals in the room.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.920]   Yeah, you got the vortex, the Sedona vortex.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.480]   I love that.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.680]   Sedona is amazing, by the way.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.280]   Everyone should go there at some point in their life.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.240]   The energy calendar technique is basically
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.560]   a simple color coding strategy to figure out
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.440]   over the course of a week or two what
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.240]   it is in your life that's creating energy
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.480]   and what's draining energy.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.640]   So the way I do it is take a week when
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.440]   you're going to do this, go through a workday.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.520]   At the end of the day, look at your calendar
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.360]   and make changes to the color of the things on your calendar
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.120]   based on what created energy, what was sort of neutral,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.760]   and what drained energy from you.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   And literally go change the color of those things
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.880]   on the day that just passed.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.080]   So if something created energy, you mark it as green.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.000]   If it was neutral, you mark it as yellow.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.280]   And if it drained energy, you mark it as red.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.560]   Do that every single day for a week, maybe two weeks,
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.240]   and then go back and look at it.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.480]   And you'll immediately be able to viscerally, very clearly
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.920]   identify trends in what created energy in your life, which
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.360]   you need to amplify and try to spend more time on,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.000]   what was neutral, which you can kind of continue to leave
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.280]   or potentially try to delegate, and then what was draining
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.360]   energy from your life.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.560]   And with those, the whole idea is
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.600]   to start slowly working your way towards being
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.360]   able to delegate or delete those from your life.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.360]   The one thing that I'm going to try with this
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.200]   is there are times, especially when you're
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.820]   working on your own schedule like I am,
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.800]   where I'll be doing something, but I
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.160]   didn't put it in my calendar.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.320]   I'm not as good as others at time blocking
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.280]   the whole perfect day.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.440]   But at the end of the day, it'd be really easy for me
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.200]   to be like, oh, for this hour, I researched this topic.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.780]   So if you do it at the end of the day,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.880]   it could be really quick.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.160]   So I'm going to go in back and also add other things.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   I'm also bad, by the way, at time boxing.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.340]   I think time boxing is near a all who is amazing.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.640]   And I think it's a great technique for a lot of people.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.880]   I really struggle with having like every minute
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.960]   of my calendar filled.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.120]   Just optically, it intimidates me about the day.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.080]   Even if a block literally says, go on a walk with your son,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.680]   it's intimidating to me to see at the beginning of a day
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.720]   every minute filled.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.560]   So I have huge open blocks.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.400]   So I actually do exactly what you just said.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.440]   I'll go back and say, oh, I did this piece of research here.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.400]   I did this here, et cetera.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.320]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.760]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.560]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.500]   to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.520]   harder as you build your wealth.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.680]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.560]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.360]   with backgrounds in everything from technology, finance,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.280]   medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.680]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.640]   I've loved being a part of the community.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.920]   And I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.080]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.440]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.160]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.960]   are first generation wealth,
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.040]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.160]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.520]   and learn from each other
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.120]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.400]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.720]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.160]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.300]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.760]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.560]   to your children's education,
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.840]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.320]   So many of these conversations
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.520]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.200]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.040]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.160]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.320]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.520]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.000]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.920]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.000]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.620]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.260]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.180]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.620]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance,
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.340]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.920]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.340]   to help protect your family
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.680]   and cross that important to do off your list,
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.360]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.960]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.480]   to help you get a high-quality,
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.200]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.960]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.760]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.160]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.740]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.760]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.960]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.840]   and you could be offered coverage instantly
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.040]   with no health exam required.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.080]   So, protect your family today with Fabric by Gerber Life.

[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.480]   That's meetfabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   M-E-E-T fabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.760]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.480]   not available in certain states,
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.680]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.800]   Well, speaking of walks, let's talk about taking breaks,
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.000]   'cause I know that was in there, number four.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.560]   This is all about attention residue,
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.400]   which is a concept that I think one of your prior guests,
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.140]   Cal Newport, has written about in the past
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.360]   that I've become somewhat obsessed with.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.160]   Generally, just this idea that
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.300]   we're always context switching
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.000]   because of the world that we live in
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.520]   with constant notifications.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.920]   So, you'll be working on something
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.640]   and then you decide to check your email.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.800]   And when you check your email,
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.160]   there's this tiny cognitive load
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.960]   that is now stuck in that email
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.680]   when you come back to the work.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.340]   And you're just getting spread thin.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.620]   You're literally just like leaving
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.200]   your kind of mental capacity
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.440]   in all of these different places,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.120]   in your messages, in your emails, et cetera.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.400]   And so then, when you're going back
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.140]   and working on the really important thing,
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.000]   you're operating at like 60%
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.060]   of what your optimal mental capacity is.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.640]   And obviously, as a result, your work is gonna suffer.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.280]   So, this whole idea is we need to minimize
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.960]   the impact of attention residue.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.040]   Attention residue is that actual scientific side of that
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.860]   when that happens and your attention
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.200]   is grabbed in different places.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.120]   And taking breaks is really a key way to get around this.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.920]   And so, the biggest way that I think most people
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.640]   can put this into their schedule and into their lives
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.720]   is schedule 25-minute meetings
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.140]   instead of 30-minute meetings.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.280]   And immediately, you'll see a difference.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.440]   Rather than having the context switch
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.840]   that comes from having back-to-back meetings
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.920]   that are just pushing you from one thing to the next
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.760]   when your mind is still in the prior meeting
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.600]   while you're in the new one
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.800]   or your mind's on the next meeting
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.760]   while you're in this one,
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.960]   you create an actual separation window.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.320]   You can go for a quick walk.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.880]   You can sit and just breathe.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.360]   It has a massive impact immediately.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.080]   And by the way, if anyone doesn't know this,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.180]   it's a setting in Google Calendar
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.560]   to turn on speedy meetings,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.760]   which takes 30-minute meetings, makes them 25,
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.600]   takes hour meetings, it makes them 50 minutes.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.620]   So, you don't even have to work hard to do it.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.040]   You could just enable the feature.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.100]   And then, when you drag an hour-long meeting,
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.600]   it auto readjusts to 50 minutes.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.080]   - That's a great hack, I love that.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.220]   I think this pairs well with your number seven
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.000]   about batching email into Windows to process.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.520]   - Yeah, this one has been a huge push for me personally,
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.800]   which is I just found myself constantly checking emails
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.480]   and texts throughout the entire day.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.000]   And so, when I started really focusing
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.340]   on minimizing attention residue,
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.920]   I thought about what's the best way for me
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.400]   to minimize the impact that has.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.840]   And what I did was I just set a one-hour block
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   late in the day,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.400]   which was when I was going to actually check email.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.520]   And initially, I definitely wasn't perfect about it.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.240]   I'm still not 100% compliant.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.460]   I will still pop it open
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.820]   because I have the finance gene in me
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.820]   where I feel like I need to be on email 24/7.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.880]   But having a window of discrete time
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.800]   when you're actually gonna process those emails
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.480]   allows you to minimize how it impacts
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.680]   the other parts of your day.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.040]   And then also, you really focus on the emails
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.560]   and you think clearly about the things
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.800]   and the questions people are asking
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.660]   when you're working on them
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.640]   because that becomes the core thing
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.120]   that you're doing during that time,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.920]   rather than it being just a little distraction
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.280]   and you're trying to process it
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.040]   as quickly as you can between meetings.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.480]   So that one's really impactful.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.960]   It depends on what your career track is
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.480]   and what you're working on
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.000]   to think about how many of those windows there need to be,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.240]   how long they have to be.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.760]   If you work in professional services,
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.480]   if you're a lawyer, if you're an investment banker,
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.840]   if you're a consultant,
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.600]   it's rich for you to think
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.160]   that you can have a one-hour window
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   when you're doing email.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.820]   It's ridiculous.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.660]   I worked in finance.
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.480]   You can't do that.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.440]   But can you have three of those windows during the day
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.280]   and get away with it?
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.120]   Probably.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.440]   You could probably have one early in the day,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.640]   one around lunchtime and one in the evening
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.080]   and be in a good spot
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.280]   where you're still getting those periods of deep work
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.940]   when you can really think about things,
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.880]   but then you also have those fixed times
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.600]   where you're processing and moving through stuff.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.480]   So I think there's a happy medium for everyone to find
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.980]   that'll really optimize this.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.280]   - I don't know the science behind this,
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.720]   but my gut would say
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.120]   that part of the reason we love checking our emails,
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.700]   'cause every time something comes in,
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.180]   it's like someone's wanting to talk to you.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.640]   There's this dopamine hit of seeing this thing.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.280]   I can say that when you start batching your emails,
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.000]   you just increase the likelihood
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.280]   that some interesting thing is gonna be there
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.520]   every single time you check your email.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.760]   So at the end of this recording,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.920]   I'm gonna go check my email
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.280]   and I'm gonna be excited
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.640]   because I know that there's actually something interesting.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.000]   Whereas when you're in the habit
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.040]   of checking your email all the time,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.960]   90% of those times, it's just some stupid spam thing.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.080]   It's something unimportant.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.040]   But now when I batch my emails,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.280]   every time I check my email,
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.920]   if it's only two or three times a day,
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.400]   there's usually something valuable and interesting in there.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.420]   So I actually get a lot of satisfaction
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.320]   when I've gone without email for a little while,
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.760]   is I get that dopamine hit of like,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.280]   oh, there's one great thing every time.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.480]   - You're a really positive guy.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.320]   I like this about you.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.140]   That's great.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.240]   I'm a dread email guy.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.160]   I'm trying to avoid the stressful thing
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.760]   that's coming into my inbox.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.800]   - Oh, no, I'm excited.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.400]   I'm like, what exciting thing could be here?
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.220]   - And by the way,
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.000]   doing the same thing with text messages
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.680]   has been a great change for me
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.200]   'cause it's the same exact impact
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.920]   when you're checking texts throughout the day.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.360]   My goal for 2023 is to try to do this with social media
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.760]   because popping open Twitter once an hour
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.640]   and looking at things and doom scrolling
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   and seeing what notifications or who's yelling at you
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.080]   or sending you mean DMs,
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.000]   just like super, super counterproductive for deep work.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   - For Twitter, one thing I've done
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.040]   is just relentlessly unfollow.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.960]   You don't even have to unfollow.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.000]   You can mute a person so you can still DM them,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.200]   but you don't have to see their tweets
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.560]   to the point that there's just not that many people
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.400]   in your feed.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.320]   So your feed is something you can manage
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.040]   and actually maybe complete in the day.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.840]   - Did you turn to the latest tweet setting
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.760]   or are you still on?
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   'Cause now that they've changed the algorithm,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.520]   the home feed is tons of stuff of people you don't follow.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.240]   - Yeah, so I still use TweetBot
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.320]   because I don't like that in the Twitter app
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.920]   and I don't like seeing sponsored tweets.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.840]   So I still use TweetBot as my main Twitter app
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.560]   and there are reasons it sucks.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.240]   It's delayed on getting notifications from DMs,
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.760]   but throughout this conversation,
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.080]   I'm wondering if maybe that's a good thing.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.880]   I would love to see the Twitter app
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.000]   be something that I could use more regularly,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.960]   but I don't use it much right now.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.800]   - The hack here is you go to the little star icon
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.120]   in the top right of your Twitter thing
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.920]   and just change it to latest tweets
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.400]   rather than doing the home.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.720]   And it means that it just does it in chronological order
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.640]   and it's basically only people you follow.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.000]   And so that cleans up your feed immediately.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.960]   You don't have all the stuff
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.360]   that Twitter is serving up to you.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.720]   - Does it sync between platforms?
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.560]   - No, it doesn't.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.960]   I literally just checked this
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.960]   'cause I had my Mac OS Twitter app was on latest,
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.480]   but my phone is somehow not.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.760]   I'm now gonna go fix that.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.600]   - TweetBot for me,
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.280]   since I only follow a handful of people
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   and they're like news sources and people,
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.480]   I could just go on my computer
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.160]   and it's like there are 12 unread tweets.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.960]   I scroll up and then when I go to my phone,
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.760]   it jumps right to that same spot in the feed.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.600]   But- - I love it.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.040]   - Hopefully Twitter can get their act together.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.560]   The one thing I'll add to this,
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.560]   so I guess by the end of this,
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.120]   it might be 26 things or 27 things to take into 2023,
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.520]   is from my reflections,
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.640]   which is just learn to outsource tasks
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.320]   to increase the ROI of your time.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.560]   I will say, depending on what industry you work in,
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.160]   this may or may not be allowed.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.280]   So check with your company.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.760]   If you work for yourself, you have a lot more flexibility,
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.400]   but there are certainly tasks during the day
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.880]   that I'm sure someone else could do
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.400]   and give you more time to spend on the things
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.040]   that are the most high ROI for your time,
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.800]   especially if your company would support you,
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.520]   maybe hiring a virtual assistant
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.680]   to help do some of these things.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   I've seen a handful of examples of people,
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.960]   especially in sales,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.800]   where they were able to hire people,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.520]   their company wasn't gonna give them the budget.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.280]   So they just personally freelance hired people
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.360]   and convinced the company that they should have the budget
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.600]   to bring this person on
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.920]   so that they could spend their time closing the deals
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.760]   and drive up the actual output they got,
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.000]   their salary went up,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.720]   even net of what they had to pay out.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.880]   So I think there are a lot of opportunities to outsource,
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.080]   to optimize where you spend your time.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.200]   All right, health?
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   Health, all right.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.960]   Well, there's a couple in here that are my go-tos.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.320]   So the first one is something
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.760]   that I started doing in college,
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.720]   which I guess I will loosely call the 55530 method.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.440]   And the reason I will loosely call it that
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.480]   is because someone else called it that.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.440]   I put it in this like life hacks document
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.160]   that I did maybe six months ago,
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.240]   and then someone wrote a Twitter thread on it
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.700]   without citing me actually,
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.920]   because they thought that it was like a well-known method.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.200]   And it was literally just something that I created
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.760]   and started doing in college that no one knows about.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.160]   So it's pretty funny to me that it now has a name.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.680]   But basically this is,
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.880]   as soon as you wake up and get out of bed,
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.360]   you do five squats, five lunges per leg,
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.360]   five pushups, and a 30 second plank.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.600]   And all this does is just immediately sparks
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.800]   your energy and metabolism to start the day.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.440]   It's like a simple thing, right?
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.280]   Five pushups.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.100]   It's not like you're saying,
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.120]   "Oh, I'm gonna do 100 pushups as soon as I get out of bed."
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.600]   It's a low enough amount that it's not intimidating
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.520]   and you can force yourself to just quickly do it
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.360]   to start the day.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.680]   You can do it while your coffee's getting made
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.440]   or literally as soon as you get out of bed.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   But it gives you this huge energy boost to start the day.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.820]   And I think it's hugely impactful.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.080]   I started doing it because we had
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.680]   these early morning baseball practices in college.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.480]   And it's just a habit that's now stuck with me
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.000]   throughout my life.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.480]   What else do you do in the morning?
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.320]   I'm curious.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.880]   I think there are a few things in your health list
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.920]   that are morning routine.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.880]   I get out of bed.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.560]   I drink a whole bunch.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.640]   I keep a cold water on my bedside table.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.280]   So as soon as I wake up, I drink a whole ton of water.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.760]   I do the five, five, five, 30 really quickly,
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.320]   just like on the floor on the side,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.960]   trying to stay quiet 'cause I wake up earlier than my wife.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.860]   And then I go get in a cold plunge.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.900]   So this is a new ad.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.420]   I got the cold plunge in July of 2022
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.460]   and have done every single day since,
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.380]   three to seven minutes in it every morning at 39 degrees.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.780]   And that's been probably the biggest impact in my life
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.740]   of a single thing that I've added to my routine
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.220]   in the last like five or 10 years.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.540]   I've experienced just a massive set of benefits
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:02.420]   in terms of energy and in terms of the dopamine rush
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.260]   that I get from it.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.140]   The surge that just lasts for hours
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.860]   that just makes me feel superhuman
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.260]   during the early part of my day.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.900]   That's been the big ad for me.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.900]   - Yeah, we've just created a space in our home
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.000]   where a cold plunge will one day go.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.160]   - I don't know enough of the science to say like
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.560]   the brown fat and the metabolism and the immunity.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.800]   And there's all this research.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.920]   Dr. Huberman has talked about it, I think on an episode
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.960]   that shows all of these great health benefits.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.800]   But if nothing else other than the dopamine rush
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.840]   and the feeling of doing something hard
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.220]   that makes the rest of the day feel easier,
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.120]   it would be worth it too.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.200]   I've absolutely loved it.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.760]   I think it's phenomenal.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.600]   - Awesome.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.640]   Anything else you do in the morning?
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.680]   Well, number nine was about a tech free walk.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.720]   - Oh yeah, this is with my son now,
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.720]   which is even better on all of this.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.880]   But waking up in the morning, doing those things
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.520]   and then just going out and getting sunlight.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.160]   Again, this is like goes back to a thing
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.720]   that Dr. Huberman has talked about a lot,
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.200]   the impact of getting sun first thing in the morning.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.720]   And that can be on a cloudy day,
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.880]   you just have to stay out longer, there still is sun.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.080]   But having that kind of just being able to breathe,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.560]   not having your phone on you so that you're not looking
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.720]   and checking messages, checking email,
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.440]   checking social media, et cetera.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.000]   Is a great way to start your day,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.720]   set your body in the right direction.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.860]   It improves your mood, it improves your sleep,
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.640]   the next night, a whole host of health benefits.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.160]   But for me personally, just from a cognitive standpoint,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.200]   to start my day with a feeling of breathing and creativity,
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.680]   it has been a great habit.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.240]   - I'm gonna add a couple, I'll do them quick
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.360]   'cause they're actually four.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.800]   And most of them came from this conversation I had
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.280]   about health a couple weeks ago.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.220]   Technically I had a day ago,
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.600]   but by the time you're listening to this,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.040]   it'll be a couple weeks ago.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.800]   So one, we talked about how one of the most valuable things
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.680]   you could do is just time-restricted eating.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.720]   So you call it intermittent fasting,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.560]   you can call it whatever you want,
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.040]   but just keeping your eating window to a smaller time.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.020]   That's something that I had done for a while,
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.520]   took a pause in the holidays
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.840]   and hopefully will bring back this year.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.600]   Another is we talked about Jordan, who I spoke with,
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.480]   was like one of his diagnostic things
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.620]   is going through who are you
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.280]   and just collecting the basic data
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.720]   and diagnostics about your health.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.320]   So I'm gonna encourage a lot of people
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.600]   who haven't done this to consider it,
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.400]   which is just like get your basic metabolic panel.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.680]   Like your blood work done.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.000]   I know a lot of us, when we're young,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.080]   we're like, ah, everything seems fine,
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.280]   but trying to figure out,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.080]   is there an area you need to work on?
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.560]   For me, it was cholesterol.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.000]   That's my area right now,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   but for everyone else, it could be different.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.320]   So just doing that.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.400]   There are some great companies
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.680]   that can support that, by the way.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.700]   You can look up the different ones.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.880]   I'm not affiliated with any,
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.320]   but I've used InsideTracker in the past.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.220]   It's relatively pricey, but it's an incredible experience.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.720]   And they have a great kind of dashboard
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.560]   that allows you to track it over time as well.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.160]   They are a partner of the show, so everybody gets 20% off.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.680]   So bring that price down a little.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.280]   Another one he pointed out was stop using alarms.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.360]   And this'll be interesting one to hear your reaction to,
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.360]   'cause I know you wake up early.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.320]   And he said, switch from a wake-up alarm to a bedtime alarm.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.520]   Once you learn how much sleep your body needs
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.960]   to naturally wake up,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.400]   then instead of setting your alarm for 5 a.m.,
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.600]   which I think is something you do,
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.680]   figure out how much sleep you need
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.160]   and set your go-to-bed alarm,
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.720]   because there's just so much magic that happens
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   while you're asleep that interrupting that process
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.180]   can have an impact on your health.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.960]   And if you could force that to be different,
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.800]   that's better.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.800]   So I actually don't use an alarm in the morning
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.680]   because I've gotten pretty good at waking up naturally
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.560]   around the same time,
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.380]   as long as I go to bed at the right time.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.360]   That's an interesting one.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.680]   I've always just loved alarms.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.000]   So I'm not trying to take it away, just switch.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.760]   I originally needed them
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.040]   because I just wasn't sleeping enough.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.360]   And so I just needed to get up early.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.000]   When I was working in finance in my early days,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.760]   I was getting up at like 3.45,
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.480]   going to bed probably by 10.30.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.800]   I just wasn't sleeping enough for like a period of six years.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   I've recently, over the last year and a half,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.560]   started taking sleep very seriously.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.400]   And now I just have a grandpa schedule, man.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.360]   I'm asleep by 8.30 and I'm up by between four and five,
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.520]   depending on the day.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.080]   And I get my seven to eight hours and I feel great.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.860]   And I wake up and I don't have an issue with it,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.320]   but maybe I should experiment with it.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.840]   And then the last was along the lines of that apple.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.440]   I had this like negative impression of fruit
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.280]   my whole like last few years.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.440]   I was like, well, fruit has sugar.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.720]   If fruit is sugar, can't be good for you.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.040]   And if I'm going to have sugar, why not eat a cookie?
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.240]   My wife has told me that was crazy forever.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.000]   And we finally dug into the science behind it.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.440]   And it's like, fruit is actually pretty good.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.680]   There are some fruits that are not as good as others.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.120]   Like I think a mango,
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.560]   especially when it's dried or in juice form,
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.520]   is maybe more like a soft drink than something.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.560]   But I'm going to try as part of this cholesterol plan
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   to replace dessert with like fruit and dark chocolate.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.600]   It's a great approach, by the way, for limiting calories.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.960]   Like you get the sweetness hit,
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.800]   but you don't have the negative impact.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.640]   So I love that one.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.460]   That's a great ad.
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.440]   And the amount of fiber in an apple,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.240]   like you just can't have five apples.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.360]   Like I can tell everyone listening from experience,
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.720]   you can have five cookies.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.600]   Like it is a physically possible thing.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.240]   I don't think I could eat five apples.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.280]   No, you definitely couldn't.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.400]   And by the way, this all goes to one of my health hacks,
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.960]   which is to just do all of your shopping
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.840]   on the outer perimeter of the grocery store.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.440]   If you just do that, you will immediately get healthier,
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.520]   lose weight, be in better shape, et cetera,
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.840]   because all of the good stuff is on the outer aisles
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   and all the bad stuff is on the inner aisles.
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.720]   One fun financial kind of psychological money hack
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.400]   that I learned in an episode a long time ago
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.720]   was that if you walk the grocery store in the reverse order,
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.160]   on average, people save, I can't remember the percent,
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.080]   but they spend less.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.800]   Because like the grocery stores, you think it's like,
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.480]   oh, they managed to put this thing on this aisle.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   It's like, no, they very meticulously engineered
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.640]   every aspect of your grocery store
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.080]   for you to spend the most amount of money possible.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.720]   And just by going to the back
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.880]   and working your way around the other way,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.160]   you will avoid certain marketing things,
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.600]   certain various elements that are trying
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.440]   to get you to spend.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.560]   - It's like Ikea, man.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.760]   Ikea has that maze that you have to go through at the end
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.120]   that is so perfectly engineered
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.440]   to make you buy shit you don't need.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.280]   - I remember one time we were like,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.920]   we just need to find an accent chair.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.440]   And I was like, it is so hard to get to anywhere in Ikea
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.240]   without following the map.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.720]   Like, there's like a couple like hidden doors.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.680]   You're like, can I go through this?
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.640]   I just need a chair.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.480]   - Oh, so good.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.300]   - So that's health.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.140]   Jordan and I actually talked about
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.280]   doing some follow-up episodes.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.640]   So I wanna get more serious on that this year.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.120]   I'm excited for Peter Attia's book,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.880]   "Outlive" coming out later this year.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.200]   All right, let's talk about personal
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.680]   before we wrap and money.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.060]   - I just wanna thank you, Quik,
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.360]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.200]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.680]   and discounts from our partners,

[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.460]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.300]   - Okay.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.820]   Personal, again, going back to one of your prior guests,
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.400]   Cal Newport, I think this is back in college.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.520]   I first read this from him.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.660]   He had a blog piece about like a shutdown ritual
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.820]   or something like that.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.220]   I call it a power-down ritual,
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.240]   but basically creating a very fixed separation
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.580]   between your professional life and your personal life
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.660]   is something that you can do
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.580]   that immediately improves your mental health
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.820]   and has definitely had an impact on my life.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.940]   This is like establishing a sequence of events
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.780]   that you do at the end of your day
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.820]   that mentally and literally marks the end of your workday.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.460]   So it might be like checking messages for the last time
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.180]   and firing off any last emails that you need to set.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.980]   Might be doing the little bit of prep
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.340]   for your next morning's work
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.460]   to kind of set yourself up to hit the ground running.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.540]   Might be checking Slack.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.420]   Whatever it is, you kind of do this one set sequence
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.580]   of a couple of events.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.680]   And then in Cal's original blog piece,
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.460]   he actually advocated saying something out loud,
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.980]   like having kind of like a nerdy,
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.780]   actual like shutdown sequence initiated thing
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.260]   that triggers in your mind that the day is over.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.360]   And the whole goal is that
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.700]   once you do this shutdown sequence, you're off.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.100]   You're not checking email.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.860]   You're not going and looking at things.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.980]   That's it for the day.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.540]   And it's just a really helpful practice,
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.100]   especially in this hybrid and remote work world
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.740]   that we're living in where it's so easy
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.820]   to let professional and personal blur.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.980]   I don't have a ritual yet.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.820]   And I think people learn this when you have kids.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.540]   It's like, you wanna have your quality family time
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.860]   'cause you're working during the day.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.460]   You kind of have to do this, but I don't have a ritual.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.900]   And I feel like I'm gonna bring that one into this year.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.740]   So it's a good one.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.580]   I like that.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.540]   Two more for you really quick on the personal side.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.860]   If you're in a relationship,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.260]   tell your partner one thing you appreciate
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.460]   about them every single night.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.180]   And this can be the tiniest thing.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.340]   It can be like, I appreciate how you picked up that one thing
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.760]   or how you let me know about X, Y, or Z.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.700]   Just tell them one small thing
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.120]   because as relationships go on,
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.260]   it's really easy to just not think about all the good
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.420]   and to just have the stressful or the tension
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.420]   or the anxiety be the things that you hold in your mind.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.340]   And doing this every night has had a really positive impact
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.940]   on my wife and my relationship.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.740]   And then the last one,
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.340]   take yourself out for more meals alone.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.500]   I do this once a month without fail,
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.060]   either a lunch or a dinner, dinner preferably,
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.220]   although probably doesn't happen quite as often now
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.380]   with the little guy.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.720]   But just go out to a restaurant by yourself.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.900]   It can be your favorite place or it can be a new place.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.300]   Don't bring any technology or just keep it in your pocket,
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.600]   put it on airplane mode.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.400]   You can bring a book, you can bring a notebook
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.140]   if you wanna journal and write things,
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.860]   but just sit by yourself and allow yourself
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.860]   to sort of be bored and just observe the world around you
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.500]   and have a nice meal by yourself.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.140]   Huge unlock that not enough people are doing.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.980]   I love this one.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.940]   I'll share one that's similar for people with family.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.940]   And it's, if the theme of yours was,
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.260]   you don't always have to eat with your partner
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.820]   or with someone else, you can eat by yourself.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.420]   Mine is you don't always have to spend
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.100]   all of your family time with all of your family.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.080]   You mentioned you'd take walks with your son.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.760]   I think that it's important to have quality time
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.320]   as a family and it's also important to have quality time
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.880]   with people in your family together without everyone else.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.760]   So that's for us, I would say,
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.220]   encourage people to find a way to get childcare,
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.400]   to go on a date, even if it's a lunch date
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.240]   in the middle of the day or dinner or something.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   And then also with your kids alone.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.040]   Like I take my daughter on an adventure.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.500]   So my wife and I are talking about what we wanna do
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.160]   with our family in the future and taking a trip
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.800]   with each kid without the other kid
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.820]   is something we wanna do.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.300]   And spending time with lots of different
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.500]   like one-on-one stuff is also really important.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.440]   So that's one that I wanna take into 2023.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.120]   All right, last section is money.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.140]   All right, money.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.340]   I just had three in there.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.740]   We can hit them rapid fire.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.260]   First one is automate a direct deposit
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.580]   into an investment account
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.180]   that you basically never look at.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.060]   One should do this.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.400]   I mean, this is just like an absolute financial no-brainer.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.060]   Allow the money to just compound.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.540]   Don't think about how much money's in it.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.020]   Just set some low number
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.220]   that feels not super stressful to you
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.940]   that automatically goes out in a direct deposit
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.220]   into this investment account every single month.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.580]   Let compounding work for you.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.900]   Number two, automate all the simple financial tasks
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.820]   in your life.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.500]   I used to be a type of person
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.660]   that would just check all of my different bills
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.100]   and look at all the numbers and pay them all manually
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.580]   'cause I figured someone was gonna be trying
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.780]   to screw me over.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.360]   It never once happened.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.500]   And I was just wasting a whole bunch of mental energy
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.260]   by going and looking at these things every month.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.500]   So automating all of your bill payment and credit cards,
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.800]   investing, et cetera,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.540]   anything that's pulling your mind away
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.700]   from things that really matter is easily automatable.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.900]   And then the last one for me
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.960]   is this rule I have around material purchases,
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.820]   which is a way to save money and build wealth.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.780]   Make a 48-hour rule about material purchases,
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.860]   which means if you put something in a shopping cart,
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.660]   walk away, and 48 hours later, come back.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.740]   If you still want the thing, buy it,
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.380]   and there's no issue with that.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.180]   But most of the time, you're gonna realize
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.260]   that the material purchase
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.460]   that you had put in your shopping cart 48 hours later,
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.340]   you've thought about it and you don't go buy.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.660]   So it's a behavioral hack
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.340]   for avoiding the unnecessary purchases
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.580]   that we don't really need.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.740]   And if you can invest that money instead, even better.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.580]   I like it.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.380]   I do both the first thing and the second thing.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.100]   So I love all the automation.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.740]   I'm not as diligent about putting in your shopping cart,
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.020]   but I'll add mine, which is everyone knows
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.200]   that's listening to this show that has in the past.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.780]   When you're about to check out on something,
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.300]   go find all the ways you could save money for it.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.100]   Ask LiveChat for the discount.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.820]   Use Rakuten or some other platform to get cash back.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.620]   See if you could buy gift cards at a discount.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.500]   Use the right card.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.940]   Obviously, we're all doing those things.
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.620]   Especially on miso soup, by the way.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.380]   Yeah, you could save money on that $4.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   I'm gonna add two others.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.460]   One is if you're not already tracking
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.540]   and organizing something in an automated way, do that.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:04.260]   So I have two or three primary platforms for this.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.940]   So I worked at Wealththreat for a while.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:06.780]   People know that.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.860]   They have a free way that you can link all of your accounts,
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.940]   see your net worth all in one place.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.620]   I also use a product called Kubera,
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.940]   which is, I would say, if you want the free version,
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.020]   Wealththreat does a great job.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.140]   If you want the full bells and whistles pro version,
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.260]   I think Kubera is best in class.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.060]   Tracks all of your accounts across all places.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.300]   It works well with everything from manual assets
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.660]   to crypto to real estate and everything.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.540]   So I think it's a great product.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:37.540]   And I use Trustworthy for managing all of life's stuff.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.140]   So where are our old tax returns?
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.620]   Where are all of our COVID vaccine cards,
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.700]   our social security cards?
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.500]   I put all of our life stuff there.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.660]   They've built like the family operating system.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.860]   There is a price.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.540]   But when you just think about the overhead you have
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.820]   of trying to manage and find and store all of this stuff,
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.060]   it's not worth it for me.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.260]   So those are two things to just set up some organization
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.420]   for where's your money, what's your net worth,
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.300]   what are all your accounts, all that.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.100]   And then the other is for 2023,
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.300]   this is mostly for people with kids,
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.660]   but knock off the two big tasks
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.860]   that every single parent I know punts on,
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.540]   which is setting up a will or a trust or something like that
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.980]   and setting up life insurance.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.900]   Those two things are things that have been bogging you down.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.980]   Like go get them done in 2023
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.140]   because they're just like so, so, so important.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.540]   That's my recommendation for two things on the money side
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.340]   to bring into the year.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.500]   I need to check out Kubera.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.580]   This sounds really interesting.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.940]   I've always looked for something like this.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.780]   I'm gonna go check it out.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.620]   Awesome.
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.540]   Is it an Indian company?
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.300]   'Cause I think it's derived from the God of wealth.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.460]   The founder, I believe has family is from India
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.300]   or is from India.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.140]   I don't remember.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.960]   Okay, cool.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.260]   Yeah, it's a great name 'cause it's the God of wealth.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.380]   So Kubera is awesome.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.860]   By the time this episode comes out,
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:48.980]   they will be a partner of the show
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.340]   and we'll have a discount for you.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.540]   If not, go to allthehacks.com/deals
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.900]   and it should be there.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.740]   That's it.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.580]   We covered a lot.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.420]   You say that's it.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   Oh, man.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.780]   I think that's it for now, actually,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.020]   because you've written all these amazing posts,
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.500]   one on razors, paradoxes.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.740]   And I was like, we should go through all this.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.380]   And I was trying to plan for this episode.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.580]   And I'm really glad we didn't try to fit all that in here.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.420]   Oh, man.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.340]   'Cause it would have just been one of those
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.260]   like run through everything, no depth, no value.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.300]   So I think we got to have you back on
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.100]   and we can run through a few of the other things
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.900]   you've written about that I think would be really valuable
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.020]   to talk through.
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.180]   I would love to do it, man.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.020]   This was a blast.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.300]   It was really fun getting to actually talk
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.140]   through this live.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:23.960]   I haven't gotten to do this.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.540]   I'm excited to get everyone's feedback
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540]   and hopefully people come away with a few things
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.780]   that changed their life this year.
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.620]   I love it.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.020]   One thing that I like to ask everyone,
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:32.380]   which I paused in the last interview,
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.740]   I don't know why I forgot,
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.940]   was is there a place, whether it's where you're from,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.440]   where you travel a lot, that you know a lot about,
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.420]   that if someone were going to for a day,
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.140]   you'd tell them here's a place to eat,
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.120]   here's a place to have a drink,
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.720]   or here's something unique to do?
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.560]   Yes.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.420]   So in Bangalore, India, which is where my mother's from,
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.460]   that I've spent a ton of time in over the years,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.960]   there is an amazing restaurant at this pretty old hotel,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.060]   which is now called ITC Windsor.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.060]   The restaurant is called the Royal Afghan
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.220]   and it is my favorite meal in the entire world.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.620]   The best naan that I've ever had.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:08.380]   And they have a dish called dal bukhara that is unbelievable.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.060]   So that would be mine, the Royal Afghan in Bangalore, India.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.060]   Anything else you'd say?
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.380]   If someone's going all the way to India,
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.820]   they're going to the Royal Afghan,
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.540]   how should they spend the rest of their day?
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.500]   Oh man, just take in the culture.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.660]   If you've never been to India,
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.560]   it is an unbelievable and very different experience.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.620]   The smell will last with you forever.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.060]   It is a very distinct smell
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.700]   when you get off the plane in India.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.400]   Well, I'll add one extra Bangalore recommendation,
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.700]   which is not actually in Bangalore,
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.220]   but if you like to rock climb, hop on the train,
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.140]   which is a whole other experience and head to Hampi,
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.500]   which is a really cool place
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.700]   for a ridiculous amount of outdoor bouldering.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.540]   We had a lot of fun there.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.380]   I haven't done that yet.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.980]   I'm going at the end of this month though.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.100]   So maybe I'll have to go do that.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.420]   Do you rock climb?
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.260]   No.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.220]   It's like a backpackery rock climbing town.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.880]   That is what the town is known for,
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.780]   at least for tourism purposes.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.020]   Yeah, I think I'm going to pass on this.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.540]   I'm just going to stick to doing the commercial stuff.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.800]   No, you can have a lot of fun in Bangalore.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.420]   We had a great time, but awesome.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.020]   All right, thank you so much.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.340]   Where can people sign up for the newsletter,

[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.960]   (bubbles popping)
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.800]   (bubbles popping)
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.640]   (bubbles popping)
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.700]   you
