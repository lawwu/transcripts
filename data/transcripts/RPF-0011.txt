[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.780]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 11.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:59.680]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, your daily finance episode.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.020]   Eventually.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.320]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.800]   Today is July 1, 2014.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.340]   And today's show, even though it's Episode 11,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.940]   today's show is actually going to be the new first episode of the show.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.460]   So stick with us to find out what is the Radical Personal Finance Podcast
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.720]   and how can we serve you today?
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:32.720]   Thank you for being with us again.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.860]   I am thrilled to have you here with us.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.240]   And I am excited to be back in front of a microphone.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   Well, excuse me.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   That's not true.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.260]   I'm not back in front of a microphone.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.140]   I'm in front of an actual microphone for the first time.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.680]   If you go back.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.720]   And you listen to the first 10 episodes that I recorded of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.000]   you will quickly realize, at least I hope, if everything is working correctly
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.320]   and all this equipment is working correctly,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.700]   you'll quickly realize that the audio is a little bit better now
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.560]   because I actually have a microphone.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.100]   For the first 10 shows, which were pretty much kind of a trial run
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.860]   to see if I could do this whole podcast thing,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.640]   I was using a $10 MP3 recorder held in my hand.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.880]   And I was trying to lay down a comforter on the table in front of me
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   to kind of minimize the amount of echo in the room
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.460]   to try to make the audio a little bit better.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.420]   And then with the Skype recordings,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.760]   I was recording Skype with just the built-in microphone of my laptop on the desk.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.740]   So I think there's some really great information there.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.700]   But I think there's some really great information.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.460]   I hope you go listen.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.140]   But please make allowance.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.480]   For the poor audio quality, you have to look past the audio
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.540]   and listen to the content.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.660]   And this show, I'm sure the audio is not perfect, but I'm excited.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.280]   And I will improve it in the future.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.240]   But hopefully, in my opinion, it's a world better.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.700]   So we'll see if you agree.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.220]   Today's show, the new Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.980]   What is it?
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.020]   Why should you care?
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.880]   Why are we here?
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.640]   So today, we're going to explain all the details of the show.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.120]   I'm going to explain who I am, what I'm doing,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   and I hope that you'll follow along for the ride.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.140]   It's been a year since I recorded those first 10 episodes.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.460]   The first episode was recorded in July of 2013.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.860]   I didn't actually intend for it to be a year.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.800]   I intended it to be, well, I intended to be plugging along in July of 2013,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.760]   August of 2013, et cetera.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.560]   But here we are a year later.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.780]   And today, all will be clear.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.100]   And as far as the difference between the two,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.420]   I'm going to talk about the difference between them and the difference between then and now.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.540]   So first, let me introduce myself to you.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.900]   In case you don't know, my name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.780]   I live here in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is right next to West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.600]   And I am actually a former financial advisor.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.880]   And the former financial advisor is the key bit of data that you need to understand the year without shows.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.080]   Now, those shows weren't really released publicly, but I did share them with a few of you guys in the past.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.520]   And so that's the reason for the year of no shows.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.480]   A little bit about my background.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.040]   Then I'm going to talk about the show and what is going to make this show different.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.620]   So the design of the Radical Personal Finance podcast is going to be important.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.300]   And I think my background is going to be important.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.220]   I won't start with the, well, I was born at such and such a date at such and such a place.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.600]   Although I was born 29 and some years ago here in West Palm Beach, Florida, in case you care.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.060]   But the key aspect for the show, obviously, is the connection to finance.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.940]   So I am a finance, personal finances junkie and have been for a very long time.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.060]   When I was in high school, all the way back time when I was 13 years old probably,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.680]   and I should have been out playing football with my friends and getting some exercise,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.240]   I was sitting in the house reading books on investments and finance because I'd always been fascinated by it
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   and always wanted to be rich, always thought that was just cool,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.900]   and always thought that money and economics was really interesting.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.640]   Thankfully, I didn't lose that love of money and economics in the school system,
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.220]   and I just have always enjoyed that.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.280]   My favorite section in the bookstore, Barnes & Noble, was always the personal finance section.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.000]   And my favorite section of the library was always the personal finance section of the library.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.740]   So I was the nerd that was sitting around reading, I don't know, Ben Graham's securities analysis
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.000]   when I should have been out playing.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.520]   That was over my head.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.200]   But I did get it because I said, well, good enough for Warren Buffett is good enough for me.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.480]   And I tried to read it.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.020]   I never applied enough of it to the book.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.280]   I never applied it to my life as much as I could have and should have.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.380]   But I did enjoy that stuff.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.140]   And so over the years, I read every bit of finance literature that I could get my hands on,
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.460]   would subscribe to personal finance magazines, would listen to personal finance or to finance radio shows,
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.680]   would read every book I could get, subscribe to various newsletters,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.500]   spent way too much money on personal finance programs, audio programs,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.000]   and how to get rich plans, and had business ideas and all kinds of things that I was,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.460]   was pursuing.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.700]   And all of these things, in my opinion, were really good and really helped shape who I am.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:34.520]   After college, probably the important parts for at least this show without going through a whole biography of my life,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.120]   the important parts of this show were after college, I spent some time working for a corporate company.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.300]   And I worked in the marketing and brand management consulting business for a company here in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.380]   And really enjoyed it.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980]   And I was a big fan of the corporate world.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.080]   And this was kind of the cushy, my degree in college was in international business.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.540]   And this was kind of the cushy corporate job that I had always dreamed of.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.020]   When I started college, I wanted to be a Fortune 500 CEO and work in the corporate world.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.060]   And this was a good start for me.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:12.000]   But I learned over the course of a year or so that I wasn't a big fan of the corporate world and the cubicle and the 9 to 5 and kind of all of that stuff.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.540]   But I was working at it.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.960]   And this was, let's see, so this would go back to 2008 that I was at that point.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.480]   But I knew quickly that it wasn't going to be the long-term fit for me.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.380]   I knew quickly that it wasn't going to be my career dreams and my career goals.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.400]   So I was making plans to somewhere around to work at the company I was working at through the end of 2008.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.140]   And then in 2009 to leave and to go on to something else.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.200]   And so I was working on kind of what that something else was.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.520]   But I got surprised in June of 2008.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.940]   And I got surprised.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.420]   And I got surprised by being laid off.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.000]   And at that point I was young and brash.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.380]   And I'm still pretty young and probably still too brash.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:00.400]   But I had the opinion that getting laid off was something that you did if you were bad at your job.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.300]   And I didn't think I was bad at my job.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.280]   I thought it was good at my job.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.480]   I had just gotten a very nice pay raise a couple months earlier.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.600]   And I had just gotten, I was involved in some projects.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.800]   And I was getting good feedback.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.020]   And my performance reviews and all that were good.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.120]   But the company that I worked with.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.160]   Made a management decision to adjust their, I guess, employee structure.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.480]   And they eliminated my job position.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.520]   Laid me off and everyone else who was in my job position.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.380]   And was pretty surprised by that.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.920]   Caught me pretty flat footed.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.820]   And, you know, I learned something through that.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.140]   I definitely learned that you don't only get laid off.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.620]   And I kind of corrected that theory.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.420]   You don't only get laid off if you're bad at your job.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.740]   There are lots of reasons for layoffs.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.360]   Which is a good reason for a plan B.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.740]   So thankfully I had done a pretty good job with my own financials.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.480]   And financial planning through circumstances that I'm sure I'll share in the future.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.520]   But at that time I was completely debt free.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.120]   I had paid off.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.020]   I had worked really hard.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.720]   I had saved money.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.580]   I had paid off all of my credit cards.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.180]   Paid off all of my student loans.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.200]   And I had saved my emergency fund.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.360]   And again, I always paid attention to the books that I read.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.320]   I was the nerd who on my 18th birthday.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.580]   I remember sitting at my parents kitchen table.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.680]   And I applied for my first two credit cards to start building my credit score.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.240]   And I opened my Roth IRA.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.620]   And at that point in time, I think, yeah.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.280]   It was USAA that I was banking with.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.600]   And USAA was offering a new program for new, for young adults.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.400]   That they could waive the minimum amount requirements for a mutual fund.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.600]   And so I started buying shares of a mutual fund.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.140]   And I should have done it before that.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.440]   But whatever.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.500]   I waited until I was 18.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.280]   But I just have that distinct memory.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.580]   So at the time I got laid off, I had done good financial planning.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.660]   I had my emergency fund.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.600]   So I was in pretty good shape.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.700]   I was probably a little bit ungrateful at the,
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.520]   at the interview.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.340]   I kind of was so, I guess I was nervous and taken aback by the whole thing.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.840]   And I just said, wow, great.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.580]   You know, I'm letting me off.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.940]   Awesome.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.040]   How big is the severance?
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.100]   And made a really crass joke that I probably shouldn't have.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.600]   But anyway, it all worked out.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.380]   So at that point in time, here I was fresh out of college and ready for,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.260]   to try to figure out what on earth do I want to do?
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.340]   And I had a whole long list of business ideas and different aspects of a business
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.480]   that I thought were, would be, would be neat.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.140]   And I had different things that I wanted to do,
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.660]   different things that I had thought about doing.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.920]   But I wasn't exactly sure what the winning idea was going to be.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.240]   So a couple of weeks after being laid off,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.660]   I was having lunch with my former boss and he was very kind and was helping me out.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.920]   And I said, you know, if I can give you any career advice or information about what you'd
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.500]   like to do and, you know, give you, help you out with any connections.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.400]   Again, just kind of helping, helping me out any way that he could.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.420]   So I laid out for him kind of what I wanted in a business, you know, what,
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.340]   what I wanted to do.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.540]   I didn't want to be paid for my time.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.740]   I wanted to be paid for my results.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.680]   I didn't want to work for in a corporate world where I had to put in a certain number of hours.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.900]   I wanted to run my own business.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.100]   I wanted to build ongoing equity over time instead of just receiving a straight paycheck.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.300]   And there are a couple of, I wanted to work, be able to work from anywhere.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:07.900]   So at the end of my list, he said, you know, it sounds a lot like a career in, you know,
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.780]   financial services, if you ever considered about working in financial services.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.340]   At that point in time, I was very opinionated, you know, again, brash young man saying, nah.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.780]   And my opinion was, you know, after all of the reading that I had done, you know,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.860]   financial advisors are out to, you know, brokers are out to make you a broker.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.000]   And insurance is a scam and a waste of money.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.840]   It just makes the insurance agent rich.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.900]   And, you know, I could do better on my own.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.280]   I was always a do-it-yourself investor.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.020]   And I can figure it out on my own.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.540]   And so he said, listen, you know, that may be true, but you ought to at least consider it.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.320]   His son had actually interned in the financial services business and had had a good experience.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.180]   And so he said, I'm a client, he was a client actually at that time of a company called Northwestern
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.720]   Mutual, which is an old traditionally life insurance company out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.780]   And he said, go look at Northwestern Mutual.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.180]   And he was a client of theirs.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.540]   And so he gave me a referral to his financial advisor.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.900]   And his financial advisor was a person who his son had actually interned with in years past.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.220]   So I went and said, fine.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.020]   You know, I didn't expect anything to come of it.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.060]   But went and interviewed with the financial advisor.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.020]   And probably one of the more difficult interviews that the
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.820]   recruiting interviews that the, excuse me, recruiting interviews that the advisor had ever conducted.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:28.760]   But, you know, I had tons of questions and very strongly and sure about my opinions and beliefs.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.340]   And, but I liked him.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.340]   And I liked the aspect.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.440]   I liked the financial planning atmosphere that he created.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.800]   And I just really liked it.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.860]   And so it kind of opened my eyes.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:45.020]   And I said, you know, I wonder if I could achieve my goals in working in the financial services business.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.400]   So I started interviewing.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.800]   Started researching.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.720]   Interviewed at a couple different companies.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.620]   Researched various compensation programs.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.560]   Looked at the wire houses.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.080]   Looked at local small advisors.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.020]   Looked at, you know, insurance companies.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.300]   Kind of crossed the basis.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.220]   And kind of laid out my goals as far as what I wanted in a financial planning practice.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.940]   After all of that, I wound up back at Northwestern Mutual.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.320]   And opened a practice there.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   And this would have been 2008.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.380]   About fall of 2008.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.360]   And started my practice.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.380]   And I started.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.400]   And I started primarily working with insurance products.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.320]   That's the simplest way to get started in financial services.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.680]   And I'll explain.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.200]   At some point in time, I'll share some thoughts that I have.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.400]   As far as different models for succeeding as a financial services professional.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.080]   For anybody else that's interested.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   And I hope that it will help people who are researching the business.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.980]   I would have liked to have had more information at that time when I was researching the business.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.400]   I'll share the thoughts and the ideas that I have.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   On that at some point in the future.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.000]   But for now, I started with insurance.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.640]   Life insurance.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.920]   Disability income insurance.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.900]   Long-term care insurance.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.640]   And health insurance.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.440]   And then as I was able to get my licenses squared away.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   And grow in ability.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.780]   I started working with the investment business.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:06.960]   And became primarily really built into having a goal with being an investment advisor.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.320]   And I enjoyed the technical aspects of financial planning.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.120]   So I tried to focus my practice on working a lot with business owners and with retirees.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.800]   Because I enjoyed all of the complex technical aspects of financial planning.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.740]   That those types of clients can present.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.700]   And over the years as I've watched it.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.880]   I learned a lot.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.820]   I learned a lot about financial planning.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.340]   And I learned a lot that there are many aspects to the advice that's needed.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.200]   And there's good technical advice that's needed.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.940]   And then there's good behavioral advice that's needed.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.940]   And many times one of the problems that financial advisors.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.540]   And the clients face is that sometimes they're looking for a technical solution.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.900]   When in reality what's needed is not a technical solution.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.060]   But a what's the term for it?
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.840]   Maybe an imaginative solution.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.900]   Or a psychological solution.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.400]   You know I always compare financial planning to dieting.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.760]   Dieters don't fail for lack of adequate diet plan.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.580]   And people don't fail at their finances for lack of an adequate you know financial suggestions.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.920]   They fail for other reasons that go beyond whether or not the diet works.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.040]   Or whether the financial planner works.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.880]   And I've always been a consumer of financial media.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.640]   Always have enjoyed financial blogs.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.960]   Always have enjoyed financial radio shows and books.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.580]   And always enjoyed reading as many personal finance books as possible.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.140]   And I just over the years I've noticed a disconnect.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.580]   And there's a disconnect between the personal finance side.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.700]   And then the professional finance side.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.720]   And I don't you know I never understood why there should be a disconnect.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:54.760]   But the experiences that I had was that a lot of times many of the personal finance pundits were not coming from the professional side of having worked with clients.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.800]   And many of the professional side you know just had this air of superiority in some ways.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.420]   That is almost like the technical solution is going to solve everything.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.500]   And I've seen them both as incredibly important.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.580]   So I thought well with my background why don't I start a show.
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.700]   And I thought I tried writing.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.080]   I've been writing various articles and things.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.500]   But writing has always come it's been difficult for me.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.700]   And I can talk for a long time as you'll find out.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.220]   Hopefully it's interesting talk.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.740]   But I can talk much more easily than writing.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.760]   So I said I'll create a podcast.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.200]   So I started creating a podcast.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.540]   And I recorded the 10 episodes which I'm now releasing publicly.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:44.720]   Recorded those 10 episodes with a goal of kind of using it as a test bed.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.680]   To be able to release.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.040]   And really enjoyed it.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.280]   And was not able to publish them.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.520]   And market them extensively because I was in the business.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.760]   But using it as kind of a test platform.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:08.240]   So then I went started working through the ropes of getting them approved by my company and all of that.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.680]   And basically long story short we weren't able wasn't able to get it done.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.700]   The problem one of the reasons.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.720]   And you may not be aware of it.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:23.840]   But one of the reasons why you won't hear many professional financial advisors publicly in the media.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.020]   Is that any time a financial advisor makes a public appearance.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.080]   And there are exceptions to this.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.240]   But generally the general rule is that if you see an article written by someone who is a practicing advisor.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.400]   That this person has a team of attorneys that have probably read through it to make sure that it's okay.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.240]   And different companies will allow different things.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.120]   But it ranges from companies.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.080]   And especially if you work at a broker dealer.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.280]   You have a lot of challenges because the laws are fairly stringent.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.680]   And there's a lot of liability for the broker dealer.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:02.040]   And so and rightly so the broker dealer generally is slow to approve outward facing media content.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.720]   And this is right.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.200]   You know if I were running a broker dealer I would you know you have a responsibility to your to your owners.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.680]   Whether it's your stockholders or your shareholders or whoever owns the company.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.840]   You have a responsibility and that is.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.680]   That is right.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.480]   And that is proper.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.280]   But it's challenging for the individual advisor.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.200]   So I always just had these frustrations.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.120]   But I see the good that the financial blogger world or the financial pundit world brings.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.440]   And I also see the good of where the financial advisor world brings in.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.480]   And that I think that they should be working together.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.860]   And I really want to bridge that gap.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.320]   Because it's a win win win.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.200]   The best educated customer.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   Excuse me.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   My best clients.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:51.960]   When I was a financial advisor were always the clients that had the most financial knowledge and the most financial that were the most financially literate.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.280]   That was who I felt was was my best client.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.880]   And it was a lot easier to work with someone who was extremely financially literate than to work with somebody who didn't have a high degree of financial literacy.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.520]   And so you know I want to create I want to help bridge that gap.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   So my show you know my purse a little bit of my philosophy.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:25.840]   But as I've watched for the last six years of working as a professional advisor and still consuming financial media I have learned from a lot of my mistakes years ago and I hope I continue to learn from my mistakes.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:34.920]   But one of the things that I have learned is that there is actually very little that is right or wrong in financial planning.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:44.480]   And what's right or wrong has much more to do with an individual situation with one's perspective than some kind of existential eternal perfect financial.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   And so I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.480]   And I think that's the real reason why I'm here today.
