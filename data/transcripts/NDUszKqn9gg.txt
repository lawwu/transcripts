[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   I wanna start talking about the best cashback cards
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.080]   for everything.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.920]   The new kid on the street,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.240]   the U.S. Bank Smartly Visa Signature Card,
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   because it earns up to 4% cashback
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.200]   on every single purchase.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200]   It's stated as a unlimited 2% cashback card,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.320]   because in order to get to 4%,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.640]   you need to have some money stored at U.S. Bank.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.840]   Now that money doesn't have to be in a checking account.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.440]   It could also be in a brokerage account.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.480]   And so you could transfer over an IRA or some stocks.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.240]   And if you transfer 5,000 or more dollars over,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.080]   or you hold $5,000 or more in your accounts,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.280]   you get 2.5% on everything.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.760]   If you go over 50,000, you get 3% back on your card.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.640]   And if you go over $100,000,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.080]   you get 4% back on everything.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.480]   Now, that is incredible.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.320]   I don't honestly even understand how this is possible,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.440]   because as someone who now runs an e-commerce website,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.640]   I'm not paying 4% to run credit card transactions.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.720]   So how they can afford to give you 4%, I have no idea.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.440]   How long this will last, I don't know.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320]   But I have multiple friends with this card
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320]   and they have gotten their 4% back
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.560]   and they've been very happy
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.400]   with their experience with U.S. Bank.
