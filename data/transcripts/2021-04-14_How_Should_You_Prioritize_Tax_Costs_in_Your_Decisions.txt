[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today we're gonna talk about taxes
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.400]   as we continue our tax series
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.040]   here at Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.740]   by specifically focusing on this question.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.240]   How should you prioritize taxes,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.380]   the cost of taxes, your tax savings,
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.580]   in your personal decisions?
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.580]   Should it be your number one factor?
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.260]   This is the thing, I'm gonna move to Florida
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.720]   because I don't have to pay any state income taxes,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.000]   or I'm gonna move to the Bahamas
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.620]   so I don't have to pay any income taxes.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.960]   Should it be in the middle?
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.200]   Okay, this is nice to have.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.640]   Or should it be at the bottom?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.440]   This is just something that doesn't matter whatsoever.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.800]   I'm gonna talk about that.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.740]   And I'm gonna tell you not the answer,
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.500]   because of course I can't deliver on the actual answer.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.040]   What I'm gonna give is I'm gonna give you a model
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.380]   that you can use to think about your own situation.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.240]   Because here's my answer.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.380]   How should you prioritize taxes?
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.980]   Well, you should simply make an examined decision.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.780]   This is one of those things where you and I
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.860]   could come to the same set of decisions
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.300]   and walk away making completely different choices
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.200]   because of our personal factors,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.260]   things that you look at, that I look at,
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.740]   that we think matter to each of us.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.040]   And so they'll be different for you than for me.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.200]   The only wrong decision in my opinion
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.280]   is an unexamined decision.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   And all examined decisions are right decisions.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.520]   So let me give you a simple model.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.440]   It's got five steps, very, very simple.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.900]   Number one, calculate the actual tax liability
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.400]   of a certain decision so you actually know the numbers.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.040]   Number two, calculate other costs
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.400]   and benefits of your decision,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.120]   both financial and non-financial.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   Consider and calculate the opportunity costs
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.860]   of your decision.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.220]   And then next, most importantly,
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.560]   think creatively about your options
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.800]   and look for a third path if one exists.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.440]   Look for the win-win.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920]   And number five, make the decision that seems best to you
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800]   based upon the personal factors,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.240]   not just the tax factors.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.160]   I'm gonna give you a number of examples here
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.260]   as we walk through these steps in detail.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.120]   But I genuinely believe that you can use this
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.760]   as a decision-making model
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.920]   and make a smart decision for you and your family
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320]   if you'll simply walk through these questions.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.980]   Let's begin with this.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.760]   Let's pretend that you can live totally tax-free.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.880]   By the way, I'm gonna actually give you a model
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   to live totally tax-free
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.320]   or as close to totally tax-free as is possible
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.880]   on this globe we call Earth, okay?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.200]   There is a place in the world,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.680]   at least one, probably more,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.600]   but there is at least one place in the world
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   that you can live where there are no income taxes.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   There's no tax on your income.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.800]   There's no employment tax system.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.060]   There is no capital gains tax system.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.000]   There are no income tax systems.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.760]   And what's more important and more impressive,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.320]   not only are there no income taxes,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.400]   but there are none of the other tax systems either.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   There's no property taxes.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.960]   There are no sales taxes.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.560]   There are no sin taxes on this place.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.580]   And here's what's even more amazing.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.560]   Not only are there no taxes,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.520]   but you can actually genuinely
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.260]   be given land to live in this place.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.700]   You don't even have to buy land.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.520]   You might have to buy materials to build your house,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.420]   but you don't have to buy land to live in this place.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.480]   It's a sovereign place, a sovereign country,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.380]   and it has all of these factors.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, the name of this place is Pitcairn Island.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360]   Pitcairn Island.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.600]   Perhaps you've heard of it.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   It's a group of four small volcanic islands
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.940]   in the Southern Pacific Ocean.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.820]   They form the sole British overseas territory
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.360]   in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.560]   These four islands, Pitcairn Proper, Henderson,
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.760]   Ducey, and Ono, are scattered
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000]   across several hundred kilometers of ocean.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.360]   They have a combined land area of about 18 square miles,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.840]   very important.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.760]   The largest country, the nearest country
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.640]   to the Pitcairn Islands would be French Polynesia,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.240]   found at a distance of 1500 miles,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.540]   followed by the Cook Islands, 2000 miles away.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.480]   New Samoa, Tonga, let's see, Chile,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.660]   would be the next closest big country
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.280]   that you might be familiar with, 3375 miles away.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   And going down the list, it continues.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.120]   The point is that Pitcairn Island
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   is in the middle of nowhere.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.160]   So while you have all of these benefits,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.360]   no taxes, they'll give you land if you come be there.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.000]   Oh, and by the way, the population is something
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.480]   like 40 to 50 people who live there, total.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.760]   So you genuinely do have all these options.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.700]   And you could live there.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.200]   Maybe you're an internet billionaire, right?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.720]   A Bitcoin billionaire.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.080]   And you can move there.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.620]   You can set up a nice satellite dish
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.540]   to get your satellite communications.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.120]   Maybe you can get your email over HF radio.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.420]   And so you can genuinely move to Pitcairn Island.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.580]   Would you do it to have no tax liability?
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.640]   Would you make taxes your number one thing
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.260]   and move to Pitcairn Island?
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.520]   I would say with almost total certainty,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   of course you wouldn't, right?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.880]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.080]   I have zero interest in moving to Pitcairn Island.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   Visiting, yes.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.000]   Moving there, zero interest whatsoever.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.320]   I'm not going to move to Pitcairn Island
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.200]   to get free land and no tax.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.960]   It's just not worth it.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.840]   So I think we can start by saying we would all agree
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   that taxes are not our sole decision-making criteria.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.420]   But how important are they genuinely?
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.360]   Well, you don't know until you do step one,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.880]   which is start by actually calculating the numbers.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   The numbers here matter.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.080]   And if you're going to make a good decision about this,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.840]   you need to actually calculate the cost of a tax liability.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   And this is something that almost none of us
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.000]   are even capable of doing.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.640]   It's hard for me.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.160]   I am a certified financial planner.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.640]   I'm a chartered financial consultant.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.200]   I have all these other degrees and designations
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.960]   that say that I should know how to do this.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.200]   And I still have a very difficult time sitting down
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.640]   and actually tracking the total taxes that I pay
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.280]   and actually knowing the cost of any particular move.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.800]   It's very difficult.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.420]   But you want to start with as close
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.200]   to correct numbers as you can.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.240]   If you're thinking about buying a house in a certain county,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.440]   you need to know what is going to be
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   the property tax of that house.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.800]   Sometimes this makes a big difference.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.080]   Where I used to live in South Florida,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.640]   I used to live fairly close to the county line
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.300]   between Martin County and Palm Beach County.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.520]   But there's a big difference in property tax assessment
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.080]   rates between Martin County and Palm Beach County.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.420]   And there are all these interesting little communities
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.680]   that you have no idea whether you're in Palm Beach County
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.200]   or Martin County, but your tax assessor does.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.480]   And if you're just thoughtful about
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.600]   which particular house you buy,
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.580]   you can potentially over the course of the decades
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.560]   you might live in that house,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.840]   save thousands and tens of thousands of dollars in taxes
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.080]   because Martin County has a tax rate,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.360]   I think about half of what Palm Beach County taxes
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.920]   and imposes, right?
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.460]   There are many places in the world that you can live
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.180]   in a certain country where you can live
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.040]   right on a state line.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.100]   And on one side of the state line,
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.200]   you pay no state level income taxes.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.620]   On the other side of the state line, you pay a lot.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.080]   Classic example here would be, I think,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.420]   a place like Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Lake Tahoe, California.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.740]   Same town, state line runs right through it.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.640]   But if you live on one side of the state line,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.380]   you have no state income taxes.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.040]   You live on the other side of the state line,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.840]   you have high state income taxes.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   And the property values and property prices
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.640]   often reflect this.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.200]   But you wanna actually know the cost.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.640]   Many years ago, when I was working
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.880]   as a professional financial advisor,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.360]   I had a client of mine who was offered a job
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.440]   in North Carolina.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   She was a pharmacist living and working in Florida.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.000]   Her husband was a physical therapist
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.240]   and she had been offered a job in North Carolina.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.360]   So we were talking about whether she should take the job.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.000]   And of course we had the salary figures for both jobs.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.360]   We had the job offer.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.520]   First thing that I did though,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   was do a quick assessment of what her cost
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.440]   of state level income taxes would be in California.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.880]   Of course, her federal income taxes would be the same
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.360]   in both places, but her state level income taxes
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.800]   were about a 5% rate.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.320]   North Carolina poses about a 5% little over,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.560]   mostly flat tax system on their income.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.240]   And so I calculated, all right, if you move from Florida
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.800]   and you have your combined household income
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   of X number of dollars, now we take X times 5%.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.720]   This is gonna be a cost of your moving to North Carolina.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.280]   So you need to know that.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.520]   Now, knowing it doesn't mean
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.600]   that you make a different decision.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.720]   Knowing it may just mean, all right,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.560]   well, I use it for negotiations.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.540]   Hey, I'd like to take this job offer in North Carolina,
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.960]   but if I move from Florida, North Carolina,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.440]   I have to start paying state level income tax,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.320]   I need a higher job offer.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.600]   Or maybe another thing that you're doing,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.680]   you're currently working as a contractor
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.920]   and you're trying to consider whether you should go
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.120]   and take a job as an employee for the same company
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.480]   that you contract for.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.960]   And they're making you a job offer.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.440]   Well, you need to calculate.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.000]   What are gonna be the tax consequences of that decision?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.160]   So you sit down, you calculate it as much as possible.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.000]   And at the very least,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.080]   you use it as a negotiating bargaining chip.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.920]   Might go the other way.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.380]   You're an employee and you're trying to think
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.840]   about becoming a contractor.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.040]   Well, sit down and calculate the actual numbers.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.560]   Because until you have some actual number to go by,
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.440]   you don't really have any starting point
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.560]   other than just an emotional guess.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.720]   And you may be surprised at the number.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.840]   I would bet you very well were probably surprised
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.480]   at some of the numbers that I shared
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.360]   in the most recent episode of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.160]   When I shared how I, as a father of four children,
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.440]   I could live in the United States
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.280]   and basically earn $100,000 per year
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.000]   and pay $0 of federal income taxes
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.400]   living in the United States.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.600]   Pretty cool.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.080]   Right, I was a little surprised when I sat down
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   and calculated the numbers again.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.200]   And by the way, I didn't include,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.680]   all I included was the child tax credit.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.920]   That was basically it, right?
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   The tax liability on $100,000 of income
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   was like $8,243, something like that.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.680]   And the child tax credits with four children,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.760]   $8,000 child tax credit, boom,
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.600]   wiped out my tax, the federal income tax liability.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.680]   So you wanna calculate the estimated tax liability
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.300]   of a certain decision.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.920]   Number two, you need to calculate other costs
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.880]   and benefits of your decision.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.040]   Let's start with some financial examples.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.960]   When you're looking at tax savings,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.160]   there's all kinds of interesting ideas.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   I have a friend of mine who refuses to have a new boat.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.960]   In the state of Florida,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.520]   if you have a boat that is 30 years old or older,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   and if that boat is used for recreational uses,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.960]   and if the whole boat matches,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.920]   meaning the powertrain of the original boat
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.000]   is basically the same type of powertrain
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   that the current boat has,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.520]   then you can actually be exempt
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.120]   from the annual state registration fees
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.200]   in the state of Florida.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.900]   So you don't have to pay the annual tax
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.100]   for your boat ownership.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.720]   So my friend likes saving money on taxes,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.880]   and so he buys antique boats, has antique boats,
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.320]   and pays no tax on his annual registration fees,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   which is cool, cool for him, right?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.000]   But what's the problem from my perspective?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   Well, you need to calculate the other associated costs.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.880]   So for me, when I think about owning a 30-plus-year-old boat
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.880]   I get really concerned about the costs of maintenance.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.040]   I get really concerned about the ability
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.620]   to find spare parts as easily
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.520]   if I had a boat that's five years old.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.440]   And to me, if there is a substantial difference there,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.680]   I'd just as soon go ahead and pay the tax,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.840]   which is a relatively simple, knowable number
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.160]   that all things considered is fairly low.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.920]   I'd just as soon pay that annual registration tax
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.040]   and not have to pay higher maintenance costs
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   on the older boat.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.960]   But that's me.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.940]   My friend, on the other hand,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.220]   does all of his own boat maintenance,
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.000]   doesn't have any problem finding parts,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.720]   likes working on it, so he likes saving the money.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.040]   Buys the old boat, saves his tax money,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.360]   works on it himself, all good for him.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.520]   But you wanna calculate what are the other costs
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.820]   and benefits of your decision.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.960]   I think here, though, some of the most important ones
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.340]   need to be played to things like career potential.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.040]   Let's say that you're living in a place
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.360]   that's relatively unknown, Bahamas, okay?
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.800]   The Bahamas is very close to Florida,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.900]   and the Bahamas is a place that does not impose
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.960]   any kind of state income taxes,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.620]   sorry, country income taxes.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.960]   There's no, yeah, income taxes.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.340]   They don't have any.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.880]   Tax-free, tax haven, tax-free country,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.680]   living in the Bahamas.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.480]   But there are many, many Bahamians
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.240]   who will move from the Bahamas to Europe.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.400]   They'll move to the UK.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   They'll move to Florida.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.520]   Why?
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.480]   Well, frequently, it's so that they can gain access
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.680]   to a much bigger job market,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.360]   have a much bigger career potential.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.720]   For some people, that's a benefit.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.020]   For some people, it's not.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.920]   Now, here's where I think you gotta get
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.620]   into the specifics of your situation.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.960]   And you gotta ask yourself,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.160]   what am I gaining by going from a place with low tax
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.840]   to a place of higher tax?
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.360]   What do I gain from being involved in that?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.320]   And there will be a very different scenario.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.300]   I like to think of it like this.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.320]   I imagine myself, let's pretend that I were Swiss,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.680]   or I were a Brit, or I were, I don't know, German, right?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.720]   I'm picking some of these Western countries,
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.980]   these brand names that you and I know,
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.560]   not necessarily low-tax places,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.280]   but just some of these places where we recognize
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.560]   there is a strong economy in each of these countries.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.700]   There are lots of career options, lots of job options.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.900]   I imagine myself, would I ever move to the United States?
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.640]   Unless I really loved the culture,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.660]   or I don't know, I fell in love with a US girl
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.440]   or something like that, and I really wanted to live there,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.180]   my answer is generally no.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.760]   I wouldn't wanna get involved with the United States.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.540]   I'd rather just steer clear.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.320]   I don't wanna go.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.360]   I'd rather avoid it.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.280]   Why?
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.800]   Well, because if I'm Swiss, or if I'm German,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.260]   I can travel the world and I can gain access
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.580]   to the world's job markets in a far simpler way.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.520]   If I'm German, I can move to Hong Kong
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.960]   and get involved in the import/export business.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.280]   I can move to Singapore and get involved in finance.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.480]   I can move to Dubai and I can start a business there.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.720]   I can move to any job market practically in the world.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.600]   If I need a work permit in the United States temporarily,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.440]   I'll go get a work permit in the United States.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.760]   But I'm not gonna have to deal with the complications
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.120]   of the United States that's gonna impose
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.480]   all these issues on me if I become a green card holder
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.760]   or a citizen of the country.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.920]   On the other hand, if I'm living in El Salvador
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.880]   or Honduras, and I'm just a penniless campesino,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.480]   living out in the country, and I notice
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.000]   that all of the fancy houses in town have a guy,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.920]   have a husband or a father that's living
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.440]   in the United States and sending remittances back,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.660]   I'm gonna be sorely tempted to do that.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.680]   If I'm a Filipino, I'm gonna be sorely tempted
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.900]   to go to Dubai and work.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.640]   I'm gonna be sorely tempted to go, why?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.840]   Because I gain access to a labor market
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.920]   that gives me more opportunities.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.120]   I mean, it's to me very sad.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.800]   I hate when fathers leave their families
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.560]   to go abroad to work for extended period of time
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.520]   'cause I think it destroys the social fabric
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.360]   of the local community.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.640]   I think it destroys the families.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.720]   I'm very opposed to it.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.120]   But I also consider it understandable, right?
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.240]   You can go into a little town in the countryside
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.120]   in Guatemala, and I can drive you through the town,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.520]   and I can ask you to make a guess
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.140]   of the 30 different houses, which of them
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.000]   have someone living in the United States,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.040]   and you can point with perfect accuracy
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.600]   to those houses because the remittance money goes far.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.960]   If I'm living in the United States, I might be there.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   I might not have any work papers,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.240]   no permits to work to be there,
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.120]   but I can still send 1,500 bucks a month back
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.760]   to my family in Guatemala, which is gonna help them
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.860]   to move up in society.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.340]   So it's an understandable trade-off.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.680]   So the point is, what about the tax system
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.520]   in the United States?
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.960]   Well, if I'm already German, I probably don't gain much
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.400]   by getting involved in the US tax system.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   But if I'm from Guatemala or Honduras,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.440]   and I don't have a lot of other job prospects,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.780]   I probably do.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.280]   So you wanna consider things like that.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.840]   Those are financial aspects.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.160]   But you consider where you're coming from
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.360]   and the cost of getting involved in a high-tax country
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.520]   like the United States.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.720]   You also consider other financial costs and benefits,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.400]   such as government programs, right?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.560]   Tax holidays you might get.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.240]   So when a company is saying,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.080]   "Hey, we wanna move to your state.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.720]   "Will you give us a tax break?"
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   That company now can move to a high-tax state
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.020]   because the state says, "We wanna attract you,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.960]   "so we'll give you a 20-year exemption from taxes."
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.360]   Well, that's powerful.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.400]   There can be other financial benefits, right?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.240]   A company like, I don't know,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.560]   let's say that I were anointed as the CEO of Lockheed Martin.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.720]   Do you think that I would ever open my mouth
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.600]   and say anything that could in any way
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.880]   ever be misconstrued by anybody
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.840]   as the tiniest thing that was anti-US American
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.180]   in any possible way?
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.220]   CEO of Lockheed Martin knows where his bread is buttered.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.240]   He's not gonna complain about tax.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.280]   He's not gonna complain about anything
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.640]   because he makes billions of dollars
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.760]   from the government every single year
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.880]   by selling them war machines.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.600]   And so you wanna understand, where is your bread buttered?
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.080]   So if you're working for the government
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.040]   or something like that,
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.520]   then it behooves you very well
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.120]   to never open your mouth about taxes
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.280]   and not talk about going abroad,
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.880]   not set up some kind of foreign subsidiary
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.240]   to try to lower your global tax liability.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.020]   You wanna go ahead and make all the money you can
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.080]   'cause you know where your bread is buttered.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   So it's totally fine for Starbucks to do it.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.800]   Starbucks isn't making much money from the US government.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.040]   It's not okay for Lockheed Martin to do that.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.000]   So you wanna calculate,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.320]   do I make money from this certain thing?
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   Do I have offsetting costs?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.660]   But then think about your career options.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.600]   I think this is a little more practical.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.280]   If you wanna make money,
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.800]   you're gonna make money more easily
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.240]   by going to a big city
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.040]   and probably by living in a place with a bigger economy.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.620]   San Francisco is not hurting.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.880]   New York City is not hurting all that much.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.320]   They're hurting a little bit right now.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.160]   Why?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.320]   Well, because they offer so many opportunities to people
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.200]   that, and all around the world, it's the same trend,
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.180]   but you understand that it's much easier
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.860]   for you to build a global network
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.480]   that can really enhance your career in Manhattan
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.300]   than it is in St. Augustine, Florida.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.100]   It's just totally different.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.560]   And so for people who are aggressive,
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.540]   who can take advantage of it,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.360]   the taxes are just a cost of doing business.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.740]   It's worth paying for.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.020]   It's worth getting involved in
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.660]   because it opens up opportunities for you.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.120]   So calculate the long run financial costs
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.720]   as much as you can.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.860]   Then calculate the non-financial benefits
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.100]   and lifestyle costs.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.780]   Right, there are a lot of people
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.380]   who might move from the Bahamas to Florida
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.860]   and then realize that, you know,
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.940]   actually I like the lifestyle in the Bahamas better.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.260]   And so the tax savings are just one component of it.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.060]   There would be many reasons why you would choose
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.020]   a non-financial benefit
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.660]   because it's ways more to you than the finances.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.840]   Why am I not gonna move to Pitcairn Island?
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.740]   Well, I don't see what future my children have
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.800]   on Pitcairn Island.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.080]   All right, do I really think that my children,
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.300]   if I moved to Pitcairn Island,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.940]   do I really think that my children
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.320]   are gonna be established there
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.700]   and that we're gonna keep on the island?
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.780]   Of course not, right?
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.620]   Who are they gonna marry?
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.660]   What are they gonna do?
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.140]   We're not villagers in that sense.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.700]   Like we're not subsistence farmers.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.460]   And so that's just not where we're gonna go.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.380]   And so I'm not gonna go to an island
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.200]   in the middle of nowhere
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.960]   because of what it would do for my family
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.300]   and about their future prospects.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.740]   There could be so many other non-financial things
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.780]   that you need to calculate the costs and benefits.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.820]   Let's say that you're affected
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.660]   by seasonal affective disorder, right?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.740]   Sad, you get sad during the winter time.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.380]   So you can live in a place that's low tax
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.140]   and be sad half the year,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.420]   or you can move to a place that's high tax
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.220]   and be happy half the year or happy all the year.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.860]   Well, to me, I'd do that.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.180]   I'd do that.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.380]   There can be lots of other things, right?
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.380]   Maybe you face some kind of discrimination, right?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.700]   In the place that you live.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.380]   Well, if I face some kind of discrimination,
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.300]   I'll leave a place that's low tax
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.000]   where I can't get ahead
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.040]   or I'm hated for some innate characteristic.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.540]   And I'll go someplace that's higher tax
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.940]   where I can go ahead 'cause I can build a bigger thing.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.820]   And these things really matter.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.980]   They affect your lifestyle.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.200]   They affect your quality of life.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.100]   And what we want is quality of life,
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.440]   not the lowest possible tax bill.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.700]   That's number two.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.220]   Number three, you wanna consider and calculate
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.780]   the opportunity cost of your decision,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.780]   especially the long-term opportunity cost.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.140]   I like to compare it in this way.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.620]   Let's say that you are a 25-year-old man
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.380]   who's just graduated from,
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.780]   you know, you've graduated from university,
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.540]   you're getting a job, okay?
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.780]   You're not yet totally enveloped
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.640]   in the network of a local place.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.620]   You still have an opportunity.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.920]   Wherever you go next, you can settle down
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.420]   and build good options for yourself.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.160]   You can build a good network wherever you go.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.420]   Well, you have a choice.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.060]   You can pick New York City or you can pick Miami, Florida.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.340]   These are not your only two choices,
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.940]   but they're two choices.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.620]   And I think they're good examples.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.060]   You have these big cities that offer big city stuff,
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.860]   big city nightlife, big city environment.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.660]   They have their good weather and their bad weather, right?
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.900]   Miami's hot in the summer and New York's hot in the summer.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.300]   Miami's beautiful in the winter.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.240]   New York is New York in the winter.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.060]   Beautiful in many ways.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.580]   I like to go to New York in the winter.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.420]   I like to go and do the ice skating thing
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.260]   and look at the trees.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.700]   It's fun for about four days.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.380]   But the point is that you have your options, okay?
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.760]   And so you're weighing these things and you're saying,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.140]   well, if I live in Manhattan,
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.620]   I can generate X amount of dollars of income.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.620]   If I live in Miami,
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.820]   I can generate X amount of dollars of income.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.580]   But I've got this pesky state and city level income tax.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.160]   And let's assume that you do something
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.980]   that is equally valuable in both places.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.740]   You're gonna make a good career in both places.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.580]   This is interesting actually,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.300]   is significant portions of the finance business
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.140]   have moved to Florida.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.740]   It's something I never expected years ago.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.580]   It's kind of hard, but increasingly, right?
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.260]   The New York Stock Exchange is thinking,
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.500]   well, do we move out of New York?
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.020]   You can't even imagine the New York Stock Exchange,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.540]   Wall Street without Wall Street.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.980]   It's just so ingrained into us.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.820]   But it's really interesting that the kind of the movements
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.620]   that you see right now.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.180]   But let's say that you're gonna pay $5,000 a year,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.660]   just modest expectations,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.980]   $5,000 a year of income taxes
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.740]   by living in New York versus $0 a year of living in Florida.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.160]   Well, if you calculate the opportunity cost,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.380]   what are you giving up with that?
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.140]   Maybe that $5,000 is just gonna be put into savings.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.340]   It's gonna be put into mutual funds or into,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.420]   but we'll get to some exciting options.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.020]   Let's say you're gonna put it in index funds.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.380]   And so you can sit down and calculate and say,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.480]   okay, $5,000 per year.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.260]   That's gonna be my annual savings.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.700]   And I'm gonna set up an annual Roth IRA contribution
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.500]   starting at 25 years old.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.060]   I'm gonna do this from 25 to 65 for 40 years.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.980]   And I'm gonna put it in mutual funds at 7% per year.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.820]   And I'm gonna start with nothing.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.520]   So at 65, that decision to live in Florida
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   is worth potentially $1,068,000.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.620]   $1,068,000.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.560]   So that's a million dollar decision.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.360]   And if I get you early enough,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.520]   and I say, listen, you can build a network in both places,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.880]   then now it makes sense.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.520]   And I wouldn't tell the 50 year old guy
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.360]   who's got this deep business network
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.400]   and all his contacts in New York,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.420]   I wouldn't tell him to move to Miami.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.400]   But the 25 year old who hasn't built that network yet,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.200]   might as well build it in a place that's efficient
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.280]   from a state income tax perspective.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.960]   Well, now let's say that you're in finance
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.880]   and let's say that you can invest in your own,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.520]   your hedge fund you're working for.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   And maybe instead of 7%, maybe you could make 13%.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.960]   Okay.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.920]   Well, now all of a sudden,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.240]   that's potentially a $5.7 million decision.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.000]   So the opportunity cost of what you give up
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.960]   potentially compounds.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.400]   So you need a lot of benefits
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.600]   to choose the higher tax jurisdiction.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.420]   What do you need?
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.360]   Well, you need the much better job prospect in New York
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.720]   than you can get in Miami.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.600]   You need the industry that really only exists in New York
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.920]   than you get in the Miami.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.800]   Or you need substantial non-financial benefits
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.880]   like your family is in New York
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.040]   or your wife's family is in New York
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.560]   or your college network is in New York.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.640]   You need those opportunities.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.120]   You wanna consider them for the longterm.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.560]   So think about the opportunity cost of your decision.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.840]   What are you giving up
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.620]   if you make one decision versus another?
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.000]   What would you invest that tax money in
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.800]   if it weren't into taxes?
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   I've often made recommendations to people.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   Okay, when you're starting your business,
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.040]   go to the tropical MBA, right?
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.940]   Go to a low cost living place,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.940]   go to Thailand or Vietnam or someplace like that and set up
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.880]   and then also do it tax efficiently.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.720]   Why?
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.280]   Well, because if you can live cheaply
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.040]   and whereas maybe your living costs in Chicago
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.160]   might be $75,000 a year,
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.680]   you can live an equivalent lifestyle for $30,000 a year.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.640]   That frees up $45,000 per year
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.200]   that you can now invest back into your business.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   In addition, maybe you save a bunch of money on tax.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.320]   So instead of having $20,000 a year of tax
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.760]   that you would have in Chicago,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.720]   you now have an additional $20,000 tax savings available
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.200]   to you by living in Thailand.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.880]   So now go and build the business there
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.080]   and then compound the numbers.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.720]   See how quickly that extra $65,000
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.600]   invested in your business can set you free.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.720]   You may now be able to become financially independent
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.560]   in seven years instead of in 27 years
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.040]   because you went to Thailand.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.600]   So calculate the opportunity cost.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.520]   What do you give up?
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.440]   Would you rather be in the high cost,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.720]   the high tax, high cost of living place
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   and go with the 27 year plan
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.240]   or would you rather go to the low tax, low cost living place
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.920]   and potentially be on the seven year plan?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.700]   Some people would choose either one.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.560]   Step four, think creatively about your options
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.020]   and realize that true win-win options
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.700]   might be available to you.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.560]   In my opinion, this is probably the biggest opportunity
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.720]   where many people don't think creatively
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.600]   about their options.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.160]   Let me give you an example, okay?
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.320]   About a month ago, a little under a month ago,
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.680]   I was watching Ramit Sethi.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.400]   Ramit is a personal finance author or a guru.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.680]   He wrote a book called "I Will Teach You to Be Rich."
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.360]   Interesting guy, very smart, very smooth,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.080]   very good communicators, built a really good business.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   Book is pretty good.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And he thinks a lot about lifestyle.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.520]   He's one who advocates for lifestyle maximization as I do.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.400]   I don't really disagree with,
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.560]   I don't disagree with much of anything that Ramit teaches.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.640]   I don't know of any point of personal disagreement with him.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.840]   I'm sure I could find him, but not an enemy of his.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.940]   He's done a great job.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:19.080]   But Ramit is an increasingly outspoken advocate
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.640]   of higher taxation.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.280]   He politically would align with more of a progressive
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.040]   left-wing political identity.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.880]   He believes that taxes should be raised on the rich,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   as many people do, and he's quite vocal about it.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.840]   He's also vocal about the fact that you should live
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.800]   the life that you wanna live.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.840]   And so here's Ramit's tweet thread.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.920]   Guy on Reddit, quote, "I'm 27 male, $14 million net worth,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.160]   "looking for a city to live in.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.860]   "City must have one, good weather, two, be safe,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.560]   "three, low capital gains tax," close quote.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.520]   Ramit's comments.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.540]   "Imagine being on track for $100 million plus net worth
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.340]   "by breathing oxygen, and of all your options in life,
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.780]   "you decide on taxes as a top criteria for where to live.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.180]   "There are two groups who make decisions based on taxes
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.340]   "that I find incomprehensible.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.300]   "Number one, low earners.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.020]   "I remember a guy making $14 an hour in Texas
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.660]   "telling me I was dumb for voting Democrat because,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.360]   "quote, they'll raise your taxes.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.200]   "Buddy, they want my tax money, not yours.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.420]   "And they should raise my taxes.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.900]   "Two," the second group, "Two, the rich.
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.540]   "Okay, you're a multimillionaire, you can live anywhere.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.320]   "You make 8% returns with capital gains advantages.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.100]   "You literally cannot spend it all."
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.840]   I find that a total crazy statement, but he says,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.600]   "You literally cannot spend it all.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.380]   "Of all the things you can do in your life,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.700]   "what guides you?
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.980]   "How little you can pay in taxes?"
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.460]   Censored, get an imagination, okay?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.500]   So this is Ramit's basic comment,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.860]   is that taxes should not be the criteria.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.700]   Oh, it continues, excuse me.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.960]   "If Reddit guy wants to live in San Jose or Dallas, great.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.100]   "But why would taxes be in your top three,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.020]   "five, or 10 criteria?
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.140]   "This dude will have hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.400]   "in his lifetime.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.700]   "This is the predictable endpoint of people
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   "who have been taught that, quote, taxes are evil."
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.300]   So this is Ramit's thread.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.900]   Now here's what I find interesting.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.960]   We don't know if this guy is a US American or not.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.660]   Let's start with him not being US American.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.020]   Actually, I'm gonna ignore him being US American,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.940]   because the US tax rules are so ridiculous,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.100]   it is worth thinking about, but I'm just gonna ignore that.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.420]   So first of all, let's say this guy's a Canadian, right?
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.420]   27-year-old male, living in Toronto, Canada.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.780]   $14 million net worth.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.140]   He's looking for a city to live in.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.980]   That city must have good weather, be safe,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.020]   and low capital gains tax.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.320]   Here's my question.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.660]   If this guy were a Canadian, would you say to him,
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.020]   "Buddy, you absolutely have to go to San Diego, California,
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.200]   "because it's got good weather, it's safe,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.640]   "and there are low capital gains taxes."
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.500]   Nonsense.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.320]   You might say, "Okay, it's got good weather, right?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.460]   "This is what San Diego is known for, generally,
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.200]   "but there are lots of places in the world
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.500]   "that have good weather.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.120]   "There are lots of places that are much, much safer
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.060]   "than San Diego, and there are places
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.960]   "where his capital gains tax could be zero."
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.740]   Now, we don't know what kind of income he's creating
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.140]   from a $14 million net worth, but let's just run,
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.780]   let's do our analysis.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.120]   Let's calculate the estimated tax liability
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.700]   of a certain decision.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.900]   So this guy, let's pretend he's living in Canada.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.820]   Let's say with, maybe he's got a million dollar a year
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.440]   income, $14 million net worth,
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.140]   but a million dollar a year income.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.860]   So he's generating a million dollars a year
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.700]   of taxable income.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.140]   Let's say that his taxes are $400,000 per year all in, okay?
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.780]   Now, he goes out, and he calculates the tax liability.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.920]   He also calculates other costs and benefits of his decision.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.480]   He looks at the world, and he says,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.800]   "I wanna live somewhere where there's good weather.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.660]   "I wanna live somewhere where it's safe,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.080]   "and where there's a low capital gains tax."
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.520]   So maybe he thinks about some of the classic winners, right?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.460]   Monaco.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.000]   Beautiful weather, exceedingly safe,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.720]   no capital gains tax, party town, right?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.020]   Maybe he looks at some of the current places.
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.200]   He looks at Dubai, right?
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.720]   Sparkling city, maybe Doha or some other place
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.520]   if he wants something that's a little quieter.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.560]   But he looks at a place like Dubai.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.680]   Far safer than any place in the Americas.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.840]   No capital gains tax, good weather.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.200]   Maybe he's beyond that.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.400]   Maybe he doesn't, maybe he genuinely does
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.520]   just have capital gains.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.160]   And so he looks at, I don't know, New Zealand, right?
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.880]   And he thinks, "Well, okay, Christchurch, Auckland,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.680]   "safe, good weather, depending on what you're looking for.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.480]   "No capital gains tax."
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.520]   And so his cost is $400,000.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.200]   You're trying to tell me, Rameen,
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.980]   that he shouldn't factor that in?
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.020]   Let's calculate the opportunity cost of that decision.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   Let's say that this guy is content spending $600,000 a year,
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.460]   50,000 a month, right?
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.060]   Million dollars a year of income,
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.920]   $50,000 a month of what he's gonna spend in expenses.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.880]   But he just says, "You know what?
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.780]   "I don't love Toronto.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.780]   "I'm gonna move someplace that has good weather
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.060]   "and I'm just gonna be tax efficient."
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.980]   And so maybe he's gonna go and set up residence in,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.300]   again, set us up residence in Dubai,
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.240]   lives in Dubai for four or five months a year.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.740]   When it gets hot in Dubai, he goes to Europe,
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.580]   spend some time in Europe.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.060]   He can go to France, he can go to Mediterranean,
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.180]   he can go to Monaco, doesn't matter.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.780]   And then he goes to Miami, right?
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.040]   Or San Diego, and he goes and spends three months
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.220]   every year during the winter in San Diego, right?
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.140]   So he's not becoming a US person for tax purposes.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.100]   He's not generating income there,
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.460]   he's just spending three months a year there.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.640]   Well, he's got great weather,
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.540]   but he's saving $400,000 a year.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.340]   Well, let's do the math.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.680]   27-year-old saves $400,000 per year.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.460]   Does it for 40 years from age 27 to 67,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.320]   invests at a boring 8% return,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.220]   and starts with nothing, pretentious starts with nothing
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.620]   'cause he's spending just income,
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.680]   and he's just doing the tax savings.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.540]   Well, that's $111 million 40 years from now.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:21.740]   Would I give up having $111 million for my children?
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:28.140]   Would I give up having $111 million for my church,
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.440]   for my charity, for my grandma?
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.700]   Would I give up 100,
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.860]   she's probably not gonna be alive when I'm 67.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.740]   Would I give up $111 million to set up an offshore trust
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.600]   that's going to endow my children
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.280]   for potentially 10 generations
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   in order to feel good about sending that $400,000
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.960]   to the Canadian or the US American government?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.460]   Seems pretty dumb, doesn't it?
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:00.520]   And the answer is, in my opinion, it's obvious,
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.840]   because it's often people not thinking creatively
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.780]   about their options
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.040]   and not realizing that you can have win-win decisions.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.900]   If you wanna spend time in San Diego, fine,
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.780]   just make it three months a year.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.660]   Don't make it 12 months a year.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.540]   If it's hot in Dubai, go to San Diego.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.140]   If you don't like Dubai, then pick some other place.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.220]   You can set it up as the point in a creative way
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.280]   that gives you the best of both.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.540]   You can have better weather, better safety,
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   better lifestyle, better culture, and low or no taxes.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.380]   So if you're not happy with your options,
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.340]   go back and try to figure out, is there a better option?
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.100]   And if you've made the best choice,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.340]   that you think this is the best option,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.100]   Josh, I don't want, listen, I'm a US citizen.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.580]   I don't wanna go anywhere.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.100]   I just wanna do there, and so I like San Diego.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.260]   Great, go for it.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.900]   But consider the cost carefully
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.660]   and make sure you've actually recognized
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.060]   what's available to you.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.380]   And then finally, make the decision that seems best to you
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   based upon the personal factors, not just the tax factors.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.540]   You may not be me, right?
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.180]   If I were this guy, 27 years old, $14 million net worth,
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.580]   I would do what I've described.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.540]   I wouldn't live in Canada.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.500]   I wouldn't live in the United States.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.340]   I'd visit them.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.420]   Canada and the United States treats visitors very well.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.660]   They treat tax residents very poorly.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.460]   So if your business, if your net worth
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.820]   is something that can be run better
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.500]   in another jurisdiction, do it.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.860]   I would choose that.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.140]   If you don't wanna live that lifestyle though,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.140]   then you just make the examined choice that's right for you.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.220]   So my answer is that taxes should be calculated
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.380]   and you should make an examined choice,
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.580]   an examined decision that's right for you.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.140]   And there are very, very good and compelling reasons
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:00.140]   why many people will consciously choose to live
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.060]   in a higher tax jurisdiction
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.320]   because it gives them other benefits,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.700]   both financial and non-financial.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.220]   I would rather live in New York City
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.580]   than on Pitcairn Island.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:20.300]   I would rather live in Paris, France, or Toronto, Canada,
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.100]   than on Pitcairn Island.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.240]   I will make far more money net of taxes
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.180]   by living in any of those three cities
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.660]   than by living on Pitcairn Island.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.020]   So I'm gonna come out ahead
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.180]   just because of my net wealth is gonna be bigger
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.940]   and I'm gonna enjoy every day a whole lot more
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.780]   than living on Pitcairn Island.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:46.460]   But you should look and say,
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:51.460]   can I get something and still get it tax efficiently?
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.020]   Can I get something better
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.660]   and have the benefits of tax efficiency?
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.260]   For US Americans, if you will just simply spend
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.260]   no more than 35 days per year inside the United States,
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.940]   meaning that you spend 330 days per year or more
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.060]   outside of the United States,
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.580]   then you can exempt the first hundred and about $507,000
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.860]   of your income from federal income taxes.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.700]   And so let's say that you're someone like me, right?
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.240]   You like traveling.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.140]   You wanna take your kids and show them the world.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.020]   And you would do that
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.420]   whether you lived in the United States
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.940]   or you didn't live in the United States.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.100]   You just wanna show your kids the world.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.260]   That's what we're planning on doing
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.420]   is doing some traveling this year.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.580]   Well, a side benefit of that is some tax savings.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.020]   It's not the number one reason.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.540]   I wouldn't leave the United States
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.820]   and move to Pitcairn Island so that I can save on taxes.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.740]   But if you're telling me I could leave the United States,
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.380]   go spend a month in France,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.580]   month in Portugal, month in Turkey,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.780]   spend a month in Dubai, spend a month in Hong Kong,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.100]   spend a month in Thailand, spend a month in Australia.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.460]   Well, all of a sudden now,
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.020]   I've gotten more personal benefits,
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.180]   this interesting travel lifestyle.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.160]   I may have lowered my personal expenses
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.900]   depending on my style of travel.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.940]   I've certainly lived a more interesting life
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.340]   and I've had the benefits of tax savings.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.020]   And so I think in many cases,
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.420]   there's a way to find the win-win
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.840]   if you're creative.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.740]   If you take the time, do the research,
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.740]   get to know yourself and work your way through it.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.840]   At the end of the day,
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.700]   I think people are simply unimaginative.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.000]   And often you've gotten so used to being abused
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.460]   by your embezzling business partner who beats you up
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.380]   if you don't pay him his fair share
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:53.020]   that you just don't think there's another choice.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.900]   This is what I find incomprehensible.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.060]   I don't understand why don't you wake up
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.700]   and realize, many people,
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.060]   why don't you wake up and realize
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.180]   that you're in business with an abusive business partner
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.920]   who's stealing half your money
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.220]   and giving you almost nothing back for it?
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.720]   You say, well, my business partner gives me a $1,300 check.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.400]   Yeah, your business partner shut down your business
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.540]   for six months.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.400]   I often imagine, okay, what if I were a New Yorker?
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.260]   I've paid all this money to live in this place
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.180]   where they closed my business down
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.780]   and refused to let me operate for months, six months.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.900]   That's insane.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.140]   That's insane.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:45.540]   I don't understand why people sit back
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.180]   and let themselves be abused day after day after day.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.540]   I'm trying to carefully avoid making this ranty,
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.640]   but I guess for 60 seconds of ranting,
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.960]   unless you're Lockheed Martin,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.060]   why do you deal with people who abuse you?
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.500]   Some point in time, walk away, walk away.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.140]   Now, I understand why Ramit advocates for higher taxes.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.280]   It's smart, it's smart.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.220]   If you're a wealthy person
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.020]   and you live in a society like the United States
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.540]   that is built on covetousness,
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.860]   where it's one of the most important,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.740]   I mean, I see it as vice, as sin,
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.860]   but today it's considered to be a popular thing,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.300]   you'd be foolish not to advocate for higher taxes.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.580]   I think if you're rich,
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.260]   one of the smartest things that you can do
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.180]   is advocate for higher taxes.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.060]   I encourage you to do it.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.180]   Don't tell anyone to listen to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.020]   You should advocate,
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.540]   or at least not advocate for lower taxes.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.940]   The rich have always had to worry
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.780]   about people coming in with pitchforks and torches
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.220]   to take what they have.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.460]   Remember that throughout the world,
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.060]   for basically all of history that we can figure out,
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.540]   you've always had 20% of the people
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.740]   have always controlled 80% of the resources.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.700]   And then in the modern world where we have better numbers,
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.060]   we know, of course, that the top 20% of the top 20%
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.780]   control 80% of the resources,
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.020]   and then the top 20% of the top 20% control 80% of those,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.540]   and it goes on, and that's why you have
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.980]   1% of the world's population
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.420]   that controls 50% of the world's wealth.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.780]   Whenever you read a story on,
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.060]   well, so-and-so, the top .00 whatever 1% owns
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.620]   X number of billions of dollars or trillions of dollars,
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.140]   just sit down and do a Pareto principle and ask yourself,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.780]   is this a normal distribution?
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.500]   'Cause a normal distribution is that 20% of the society
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.940]   owns 80% of the resources,
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.700]   which means that 4% of the society
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.020]   owns 64% of the resources,
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.300]   which means that 20% of the 4%,
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.780]   which is like 1% owns,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.860]   what would that be, 51% of the resources, et cetera.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.380]   And so there's always been a problem.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:56.180]   And so you should intelligently advocate for higher taxes.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.820]   Think about a guy like Warren Buffett.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.780]   Imagine how hated Warren Buffett would be
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.020]   if he publicly advocated for lower taxes.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.660]   But because he says,
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.420]   well, we should have the billionaire's pledge
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.740]   and we should have higher taxes,
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.140]   and after all, my secretary pays more money in tax than I do,
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.740]   then that causes him to be the beloved,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.780]   elder, wise grandfather that we all love,
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.100]   rather than the hated, greedy capitalist.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.900]   Meanwhile, what's the actual reality?
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.940]   Well, number one, wealthy people
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:35.140]   always have the money to pay for good tax planning.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.020]   They can easily afford it
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.940]   and it's well within their interests,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.700]   which is why being a tax planner for the wealthy
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.900]   is a very good business, that's number one.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.140]   Number two, wealthy people always have the choice
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.180]   to influence government for themselves.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.980]   Why does Amazon say, yeah, absolutely,
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.980]   we support collecting state-level income taxes
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.500]   on all internet commerce?
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.580]   Because they're so big now that they don't need that benefit.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.860]   They would have died if they had to collect
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.380]   and calculate sales taxes for every state in the country
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.180]   when they started, but now they're so big,
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.340]   they can do that and they can freeze out their competitors.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.740]   So as companies grow, they advocate for more intervention,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.540]   more regulation, because they have the money
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.700]   to pay for the regulation,
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   whereas their upstart competitors don't.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.740]   Number three, wealthy people can adjust their operations
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:31.540]   so that they don't generally owe tax.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.620]   Number four, if the tax regime gets too heavy,
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.900]   they can leave, rich people can leave.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.140]   It's always the case.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.060]   You saw New Jersey, whatever it was years ago,
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.540]   the story, oh, we lost thousands of millionaires
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.900]   and even the governors of the state.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.460]   Listen, we can't do any more of this, guys,
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.340]   we're losing all our wealthy people.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.140]   France years ago, wealth taxes, people left.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   The United States doesn't offer a bad proposition.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.940]   It's not as tax efficient as most places,
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.820]   but as long as you're careful,
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.580]   you got decent capital gains tax rates, et cetera,
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.660]   you can live pretty well there.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.900]   You get some good lifestyle benefits, it's hard to move,
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.900]   and so you're not gonna see a lot of wealthy people change.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.900]   And then finally, you should know,
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.140]   if you're wealthy, you absolutely know,
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.580]   you got the Laffer curve in full effect.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.660]   The US government has dialed in perfectly
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.900]   on the optimal level of taxation.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.620]   That's why I don't personally expect taxes
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.180]   to change all that much.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.460]   You don't get any changes.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.740]   You get a lot of publicized, oh, President Trump,
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.380]   we're gonna lower your taxes, President Biden,
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.900]   we're gonna raise your taxes.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.940]   I would be, I won't, I should be careful
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.100]   about putting my money where my mouth is.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:40.940]   I'm happy to do it,
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.940]   but I just try not to make reckless statements.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.780]   I cannot imagine, let's say that you get President Biden
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.420]   gets through a tax proposal,
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:53.980]   top marginal bracket, what, might go to 39, 41, 42%.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.500]   It's not gonna be over 45, no chance, right?
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.060]   Why?
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:03.700]   Because while the politicians need to claim a victory,
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.500]   the realists always know we've dialed it in.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.420]   We've got the highest possible level of taxation
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.420]   that we can get people to pay without charging so much
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.300]   that they're willing to leave.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.860]   We abuse them just enough to get enough money
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.540]   to support our lifestyle, but not so much
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.140]   that they actually decide that they gotta leave
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.140]   and get out of the abusive relationship.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.260]   And so meanwhile, it's very good policy
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.340]   for wealthy people to advocate for higher taxes.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.100]   And I'm not being, I'm not accusing anyone
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.140]   of being insincere.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.020]   I think that I'm sure that Ramit's perfectly sincere
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:35.860]   about this.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.820]   I'm just pointing out for you that it's very good policy
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.060]   for you to advocate for higher taxes
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.500]   because if you're wealthy,
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.660]   there's very little chance of it affecting you.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   You can plan around it.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.020]   You can afford to pay guys to do it.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.340]   You can always leave, but in the meantime,
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.220]   you'll get the social credibility
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.780]   and be in a safer position as a wealthy person
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.340]   by saying, listen, I'm not your enemy, right?
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.660]   I advocate for higher taxes, right?
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.100]   I'm not your enemy.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.060]   I got a billion dollars.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.740]   I could go ahead and, you know,
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.780]   Warren Buffett could go ahead and stroke a check
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.340]   and pay off some national debt.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.220]   He could do that, but he says, no,
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.500]   I'm gonna give it away, right?
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.860]   I'm altruistic.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.700]   We're gonna give it away.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.220]   We're gonna give it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.220]   et cetera, and he gets the social credibility
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.180]   while he's alive.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.620]   So that's kind of a minor tangent,
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.220]   but you should recognize always
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.500]   that it's good public policy for wealthy people
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.700]   to advocate for higher taxation
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.100]   'cause you're well-protected
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.420]   if there actually is higher taxation.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.180]   You can always leave, go elsewhere, get out of the tax net,
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   but in the meantime, you'll get much more social credibility,
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.700]   much more popularity, which you can enjoy now in this space.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.420]   So forgive me for this minor tangent.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.340]   I just think it's important that you recognize
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.300]   how these social dynamics work.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.260]   That's it for today's show.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.820]   In summary, I would simply say you should consider taxes.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.380]   Follow this process that I've outlined for you.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.460]   Calculate the actual tax liabilities of a certain decision.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.380]   If you're thinking about moving
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.100]   from Florida to North Carolina
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.020]   or from the Bahamas to France,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.500]   then calculate the actual tax liabilities.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.560]   Calculate the other costs and benefits of your decision,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.700]   both the financial costs.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   You're gonna build a bigger career.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.460]   You're gonna make more money net of higher taxes,
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.060]   and also the non-financial costs.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.740]   I'm just gonna live a better lifestyle, right?
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.580]   I'd rather live in New York than in Pitcairn Island.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.620]   Consider and calculate the opportunity costs
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.460]   of your decision.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   What are you giving up, right?
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.180]   You don't have to live in Pitcairn Island.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.300]   You could live in Panama City,
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.180]   get a tax-efficient lifestyle.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.940]   You could live in Uruguay, get a tax-efficient lifestyle.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.700]   You could live in Monaco, get a tax-efficient lifestyle.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.620]   So you don't have to move to New York City,
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.300]   and it might be worth it to you to get some of those things.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.020]   Think creatively about your options
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.860]   and look for those win-win situations.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.500]   Hey, I wanna travel the world.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.980]   I'd like to live on a beach.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.900]   I'd like to do that, so why not go ahead
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.020]   and live in Thailand and save money on tax?
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.860]   Come and make whatever decision seems best to you
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.260]   based upon the overall factors
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.620]   and emphasize those personal factors,
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.820]   not just the tax factors.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.540]   Having been a tax planner for many years,
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.980]   having spent a lot of money on taxes,
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.620]   having saved a lot of money on taxes,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.700]   I will tell you this.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:21.900]   I am not willing to let the tax tail wag me the dog.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:25.140]   I'm not willing to give up something
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.660]   that's important to me and say,
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.820]   oh, look, but we saved money in tax.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.620]   I'm not willing to look at my children and say,
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.100]   yeah, I did something that I didn't think was best for you,
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.020]   but look, we saved money in tax.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.240]   It seems really hollow.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.380]   I'm gonna look for the best solutions that I can find.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.020]   Tax savings are not the ultimate goal,
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.140]   but they are a factor.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:52.060]   So this is what I wrestle with personally, me personally.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.580]   I think, okay, well, I could move to the United States
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.380]   and I could pay more tax,
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.620]   or I could spend the tens of thousands of dollars a year
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.120]   and take my children around the world.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.440]   Which of those is a better investment?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.420]   I'm not convinced that it's a better investment
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.620]   for them to be in the United States
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.340]   than to spend tens of thousands of dollars a year
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.860]   taking them around the world.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.460]   I just assume, I think,
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:20.020]   I just assume use those tax savings and save the money
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.720]   or use the tax savings and buy airplane tickets.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   I think, well, should I go and spend more tax
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.660]   or should I be able to afford an annual ski vacation
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.220]   that I would otherwise wouldn't spend the money on?
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.580]   Or should I go ahead and spend more money
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.340]   on a private school tuition
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.980]   that I might not otherwise spend the money on?
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.540]   Should I hire a private tutor?
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.940]   Is it better for me to move to Atlanta, Georgia
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.880]   and live in Atlanta, Georgia,
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.980]   or should I take the same $50,000 a year of tax
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:03.380]   and live in a tax efficient place
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.260]   and spend that on a private tutor?
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.540]   Right, these are the trade-offs,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.280]   these are the opportunity costs.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.380]   So I am not willing to prioritize taxes
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.740]   at the height of the list.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.940]   I'm not willing to move to Pitcairn Island.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.660]   But if I can find that win-win,
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.280]   if I can find that balance,
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.320]   to me, that's a compelling thing.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.460]   That balance might be Miami, Florida.
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.660]   Right, that balance might be the Bahamas.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:37.080]   But can I find that balance
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.880]   that puts me in the overall best situation?
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.060]   I encourage you to think about it and think creatively.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.760]   Don't let taxes drive your life,
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.600]   but don't ignore them either
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.240]   because they are a real net cost
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.860]   that takes money out of your pocket
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.440]   and sends it to someone else.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.960]   Thank you so much for listening, I really appreciate it.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.840]   Be back with you very soon.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.960]   I would just ask today,
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   if you have not left me a rating and a review,
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.800]   I would be so grateful if you would do that.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.940]   Just take a quick moment right now,
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.560]   click pause, grab whatever app you're listening to me on,
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.580]   and just simply leave a quick star rating and a review.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.520]   One or two sentences is perfect,
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.280]   but that would really help my show to grow
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.600]   and I'd be so grateful.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.520]   Thank you so much.
