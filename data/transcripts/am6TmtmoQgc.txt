[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.300]   All of this is a plea for unity in the church.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.780]   The unity of the church is the church's greatest testimony,
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.580]   and yet it seems to be the hardest thing to see realized.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.200]   Given that this is such a high calling, heavenly calling, holy calling,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.300]   what the Lord wants from us is lowliness.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.080]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.580]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:57.980]   Open your Bible.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620]   Open your Bible to Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:10.080]   This is a very important book, and I have chosen to go through it, if ever so slowly,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.800]   because it is so foundational to our Christian life.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.500]   And we find ourselves now in chapter 4,
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.620]   and we're trying to work our way through verses 1 to 6.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.960]   This is the third verse.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.720]   This is the third message in chapter 4, 1 to 6,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.720]   and we will actually get a third of the way through verse 2.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160]   But you'll see why.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.520]   Let me read the text to you, chapter 4, verses 1 to 6.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.460]   "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.900]   with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.660]   showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.880]   Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.700]   There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.500]   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.520]   all and in all."
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.540]   What clearly strikes you here is the repetition of "one" in verses 4, 5, and 6.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.080]   And this is the foundation of our unity.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.020]   That is a creed, you might say.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.120]   That is a theological creed that celebrates the oneness of divine reality, realities related
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   to salvation.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.920]   And based upon that, we are to be diligent, verse 3 says, "to preserve the unity of the
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520]   Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.180]   Everything about our salvation, everything about the work of God.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.440]   It has a oneness to it, a unity.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.640]   That should be displayed in the church.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.280]   The church should manifestly declare its transformation by its unity.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.220]   John 13, Jesus said, "By this will all men know that you are My disciples, if you have
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.300]   love one for another."
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.720]   John 17, Jesus prayed that they may be one, that the world may know the Father sent the
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.120]   Son.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.440]   This is clear, unmistakable, and yet elusive in the experience and life of the church in
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320]   the world.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.060]   So I want to take a little bit of time as we go through this to help you understand
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:53.920]   these very important components that lead up to unity that will make our living consistent
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   with the creed.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:07.500]   Now, let's think back to how we got to chapter 4 in Ephesians, and let's talk about what all
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.320]   true Christians possess.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.520]   It started in chapter 1, verse 3, "We're all blessed with all spiritual blessings in the
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.840]   heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.080]   All true Christians possess all spiritual blessings.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.400]   And Paul delineates these blessings.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:36.340]   All the way from election to glorification, down through verse 14 of chapter 1, and culminates
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.720]   it in verse 15, which expresses our love for the saints.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:52.640]   We are all possessors of the same full range of blessings in Christ, salvation blessings,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.040]   and they culminate in love for all the saints.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.500]   As he goes on in that chapter, Paul continues to talk about what we all possess as true
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.680]   believers.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.260]   We possess these same spiritual riches.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.000]   We have been lavished with spiritual riches, with power, with strength, because we are
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.100]   in Christ.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.060]   He is our life.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.520]   He is our head, and we are His body.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.680]   So we are connected to Christ in that unity, that spiritual unity.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.280]   As you come to chapter 2, Paul says we all started out in the same condition.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.000]   We were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.600]   We were walking according to the course of this world.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.980]   We were under demonic and satanic influence.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.200]   But we were all saved by grace through faith, not of works.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.720]   But we were saved unto good works, which God before ordained that we should walk in them.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.620]   So we all started out with all the same spiritual blessings.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.660]   We all came to engage with these blessings, to receive these blessings when we were saved
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.120]   by God's divine grace through faith.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.140]   We have now become Christ's, and Christ is ours, and we are in Him, and He is in us.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.680]   We are His body.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.540]   As we go further into chapter 2, we find, again celebrating our unity, that all believers,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.220]   whether Jew or Gentile, are one new man.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.260]   It doesn't matter what their ethnicity is.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260]   We are all one.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.700]   We are one new man.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.580]   We are all fellow citizens.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.960]   We are all members of God's household, God's family.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   We are one building.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.240]   We are one holy temple for the Lord.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.960]   We are built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.260]   It also says that in chapter 2.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.400]   So again, all of these things mark out our unity.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.900]   And then in chapter 3 we read that we are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body,
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.380]   fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, and that collectively
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:09.140]   and together, verse 19 of chapter 3, we are filled up to all the fullness of God, so that,
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:18.760]   verse 21, God can be glorified in the church, and in Christ Jesus the church displays its
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.340]   redemption to all generations forever and ever.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:30.160]   So Paul has been going through these three chapters, lavishing on us all our spiritual
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   blessings.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.460]   The idea is to help us understand we all have the same blessing.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.780]   We are all one.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.900]   And that comes out, as I read a moment ago in verses 4 through 6, where Paul goes back
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.460]   to the foundations of our faith: one body, one spirit, one hope of your calling, one
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.980]   Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.700]   And one God and Father.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:03.740]   All of this is a plea for unity in the church, for unity in the church.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:11.540]   But even with all these pleas, there are some necessary attitudes and some necessary spiritual
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:18.060]   dynamics that have to be at work in a church to fulfill this calling.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.620]   And that's what we find in this passage before us.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.160]   First, there is the call to walk worthy.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.620]   Look at verse 1: "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord" - he was actually a prisoner
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.220]   when he was writing this - "the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.980]   worthy of the calling with which you have been called."
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.840]   We looked at that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.900]   The call to walk worthy.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.160]   The word "worthy" is axios .
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.340]   It means equivalent.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.460]   In other words, our conduct should match our convictions.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   It's equivalent.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.300]   Our duty should match our doctrine.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.980]   Our behavior should match our belief.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.800]   This is Christian Life 101.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.540]   If you say you belong to the Lord, you ought to walk the way He walks.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.420]   This is the basic reality of every Christian's life.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.300]   What you are in position, what you are in possession, you need to be in conduct.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   "Anything other than that is not worthy."
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   That is hypocrisy.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:31.500]   And anything other than that, of course, cripples the message of saving power because it doesn't
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:37.160]   demonstrate that transformation to the world if people are hypocritical.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.000]   And again, we have to come back to the fact that the unity of the church is the church's
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.700]   greatest testimony, and yet it seems to be the hardest thing to see realized.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.140]   So the call to worthy walk, we talked about it.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.780]   But as you come to verse 2, then we look at the characteristics of this worthy life
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.260]   or this worthy walk.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.040]   And the characteristics might be a little surprising because given that this is such
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:12.160]   a high calling, heavenly calling, holy calling, what the Lord wants from us is lowliness.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.480]   Verse 2: "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.980]   in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.120]   Again, the goal is always the unity of the Spirit.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   That is the demonstrated testimony of transforming gospel power.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.260]   But in order to get to that unity, there have to be some virtues that are manifest and that
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.620]   are established as the priorities in the life of every Christian.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.080]   And notice in verse 2, and I want to take time with this because these are what is essential
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.820]   to being a Christian in the church in such a way that the church becomes one.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.960]   Verse 3: "With all humility and gentleness, showing tolerance for one another, showing
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.880]   tolerance for one another, showing tolerance for one another, showing tolerance for one
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   another, showing tolerance for one another, showing tolerance for one another, showing
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   tolerance for one another, showing tolerance for one another, showing tolerance for one
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   another.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   With all humility."
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   The Christians invented this word.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.440]   Literally, the word means "to think lowly of yourself," "to think lowly of yourself."
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.580]   That is a far cry from the unconverted world's interest.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.000]   In fact, no such word existed in classical Greek.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.320]   Apparently the Christians coined this word because thinking lowly of yourself was the
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.660]   last thing that Greek culture wanted to have.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.480]   "To advocate as a virtue."
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.840]   We would be the same in our culture today as would be almost every culture throughout
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   human history.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.680]   You're supposed to think highly of yourself, promote yourself, because, of course, in your
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.940]   fallen condition, pride is the default position of every human sinner.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:46.880]   But Christians have come up with this by virtue of God's design and God's revelation that
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.500]   we are to be defined by all humility.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.140]   "Not some, but all humility."
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:01.820]   This is the virtue of the person who is aware of his own unworthiness and weakness.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.360]   In other words, to walk worthy, you have to recognize you're unworthy.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.980]   Now, we're talking about humility.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.380]   What are we talking about?
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.180]   Well, I think there are three things that would simply help you to see what humility
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.480]   essentially perceives.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.340]   Number one, self-awareness.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.340]   Self-awareness.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:29.400]   A humble person is aware of his own limitations, his own boundaries, his own competencies and
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.340]   incompetencies, his own weaknesses, his own sins.
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.280]   Self-awareness.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.240]   You start by being honest about yourself, and you hear Paul say, "I'm the chief of sinners."
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.860]   Or you hear him say, "I don't do what I want to do.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.860]   I do what I don't want to do.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.860]   I'm a wretched man."
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.180]   Well, Paul is declaring his unworthiness.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:59.680]   The worthy walk is a walk of one who is convinced he is unworthy.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:08.400]   Honesty about yourself, because as we said, the default position for fallen sinners is
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.520]   to overestimate themselves, and pride is the dominating default sin.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.020]   And then secondly, I would say it's a Christ-awareness.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:27.960]   When you're overestimating your significance, your importance, your value, your competencies,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.540]   you probably have been looking to compare yourself with someone less than you, not likely
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.020]   Christ.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:43.420]   But as you gaze at the glory of Christ, and as you see Him for who He is, you get smaller
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.460]   and smaller.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.860]   John the Baptist said, "He must increase, and I must decrease."
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.100]   And then it's also a view of God, like Isaiah 6.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:02.140]   Isaiah, who's the prophet, sees God, and having seen God, he puts a curse on himself and says
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:09.400]   he's a man with a dirty mouth and pronounces judgment on himself.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:16.980]   So humility comes from an honest evaluation of yourself, and a true vision of Christ,
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.700]   and a true vision of God.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:31.420]   And the purer your vision of yourself and your Lord and God, the more useful you become.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:37.760]   In Jeremiah 9:23 and 24, Jeremiah wrote this: "Thus says Yahweh, 'Let not a man boast in
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.200]   his wisdom.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.180]   Let not a mighty man boast in his might.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.740]   Let not a rich man boast in his riches.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:49.540]   But let him who boasts, boast in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am His
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.120]   Lord, and I am Yahweh, who shows lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness on earth.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.240]   For I delight in these things,' declares Yahweh."
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.660]   If you're going to boast, boast in the Lord.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.200]   That's what we're after here.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.820]   So this is humility.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.080]   But we talked about that last time, so let's go on to the next word.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.380]   And the next word will be enough to occupy us.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380]   Let's go on to the next word.

[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.380]   Let's go on to the next word.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:47.940]   "And to him - " Isaiah 53 " - he was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open - " what?
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   " - his mouth."
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:59.340]   He didn't open his mouth.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:06.820]   He was like a sheep dumb before its shearers.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.200]   He had power.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.400]   But he never used it for himself.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.460]   You don't find that.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:24.240]   He was always humbling himself, taking on the burdens, taking the hostility, the hatred,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:32.460]   and eager and fiercely loyal to his Father.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.880]   And he is our model of what meekness looks like.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.980]   You defend God.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.080]   You defend His kingdom.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.020]   You defend His truth.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.920]   You don't defend yourself.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.320]   That's the power that's under control.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.620]   Meekness is that power under control, used only at the right time and the right occasion,
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.020]   for the right length and at the right cause.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:04.300]   So this is a virtue that goes right along with humility.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.880]   Whereas believers, we're not into defending ourselves.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.840]   Because if we are all in the same place, we're not in the same place.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.300]   We're all busy defending ourselves.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:18.600]   There can't be unity, because we don't look on the things of others.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:27.560]   We're too absorbed in our own issues.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.540]   Follow the pattern of Christ.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.840]   Do you experience that kind of control?
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.640]   Is your anger controlled?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.660]   Is your self-defense?
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.600]   Common?
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:49.220]   Or do you save your anger for holy things, righteous indignation?
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.900]   Are you honored only when God is dishonored, His Word is dishonored?
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:00.260]   Do you always seek to make peace?
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:05.340]   No trouble, no gossip, just forgiveness, restoration.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.480]   Do you respond to the Word humbly, meekly?
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:17.920]   Do you receive intrusion and instruction and love the people who disagree with you?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.580]   This is power under control.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:28.740]   And the final question is, do you rise to the defense of your Savior and your God and
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.160]   His truth?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.420]   Because that's when you should express that power.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   Do you rise to the defense of your Savior and your God and His truth?
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.420]   Do you rise to the defense of your Savior and your God and His truth?
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   Do you rise to the defense of your Savior and your God and His truth?
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.120]   John Bunyan put it simply.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:46.480]   He said, "He that is already down need fear no fall."
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:53.540]   A meek person is not proud of himself, nothing of which to boast, demands nothing.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:26:01.200]   He's not self-protective, self-defensive, self-pitying.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.240]   It is to be finished with yourself altogether, and that's the twin of humility.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.200]   That's the two.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:21.600]   It sums it up when you read how our Lord responded to his mistreatment, 1 Peter 2:21: "For you
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.100]   have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.940]   for you to follow in His steps."
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.620]   Now look, Christ died as a substitution, but He also died as an example.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.720]   And what does that mean?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.120]   "Follow in His steps.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   Follow in His steps."
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.400]   He said, "Follow in His steps."
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.900]   Jesus set the example.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.900]   You don't retaliate.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:11.940]   You suffer righteously, and you leave the vengeance to God.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:20.320]   This is the kind of humility and gentleness that leads to true unity in the church.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.720]   Never think you should get your way.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.400]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   Never think you should get your way.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.480]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:24.520]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:24.560]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:24.600]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:24.640]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:24.680]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:24.720]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:24.760]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:24.800]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.680]   You should always want to get God's way.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.840]   Physical strength is something we all understand, and many prioritize in their daily schedules.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.040]   But what about spiritual strength?
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.900]   While both are important, only spiritual strength has an eternal reward.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.960]   We build this strength by being disciplined to spend time in God's Word, and John MacArthur's
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.520]   devotional, "Strength for Today," was written to help us in that pursuit.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.360]   Each reading is presented in a short, but it is a very powerful reading.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.980]   short, clear and accurate way and offer suggestions for prayer and further study.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:06.120]   Order a copy of Strength for Today for yourself or a friend you think might enjoy the daily

[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   today.

[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.360]   Grace To You.
