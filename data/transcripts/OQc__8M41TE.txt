[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   SPF had this entity Alameda, and it was supposed to be this really hot crypto trading fund,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   but maybe it was a Ponzi scheme all along. And then maybe at some point,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   that Ponzi scheme started to run short on cash. So he decided to start an exchange,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.360]   and the exchange got more cash, and then he used the cash to pay off whatever.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.320]   I think that's one version. And then the maximally exculpatory version, which actually
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   is still really bad, is Alameda was a real company. They really made money trading. They took tons of
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.040]   risks, and SPF has talked about why he thinks that's a good thing, that FTX cut some corners
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.960]   when they were raising money, and that they had really bad internal accounting, and that basically
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   the extended entity of Alameda and FTX sort of lost track of whose money was where, and it ended
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.160]   it up with Alameda Spending.
