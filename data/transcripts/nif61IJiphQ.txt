[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   Well, in the early 5th century, Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo, found himself on the
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.360]   precipice of unparalleled societal collapse.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.640]   The Roman Empire was on the verge of falling and the Visigoths were basically knocking
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.240]   at his door and his congregation was asking him questions about how to understand the
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.120]   fall of Rome.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.800]   And here was the dynamic that Augustine was trying to navigate as you looked back through
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.200]   the previous centuries of the Roman Empire, when Rome was at its strongest is when they
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.040]   were persecuting Christians.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.600]   When Christianity was on the rise, Rome fell.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.780]   So how do you navigate that as a pastor when people are asking you what is the Lord doing?
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.280]   Why is God bringing this empire to a screeching halt?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.880]   People were quick to blame the Christians.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.200]   If only the Christians would have also served the Roman gods, then God would have seen fit
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.000]   to extend the length of the Roman Empire, but instead the Romans were being converted
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.680]   to Christ and the empire fell.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.880]   Augustine spent, you know, ten years plus writing an answer to that question, which
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.920]   is the form of his book, The City of God, and the book is so complex, if you've read
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.280]   City of God, you know it defies summary, really.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.380]   It's part philosophy, part theology, part history.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.760]   The first eight or nine books or so he spends largely making fun of the Roman deities, which
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.260]   should not win him friends or influence people.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.280]   From there he moved on to addressing the reality that there is a city on earth, it's a city
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   of men.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   They have hopes in the city of man, they have loves, compassions, desires, they have
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.280]   all the ethos and pathos of city of man is alive in people's hearts, and there's a city
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.400]   of God in the world as well.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   You have people that interact with both of those cities, but they couldn't be more different.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000]   On the outside, the two cities could even look the same, but their ends are categorically
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   different.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.300]   I think we would all agree with that, and I think the American church by and large would
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.600]   agree with that as well.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.960]   But what would get Augustine in trouble today if he were to say it is his main conclusion
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.200]   of the book as I read it, which is that the fate of the city of man is disconnected from
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.840]   the activity in the city of God.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.040]   That as the kingdom of God advances and waxes and wanes, it does not affect the duration
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   of the city of man.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.280]   I mean that's, as I read Augustine, I take that away to be his main point.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.460]   Augustine's militates against the idea that is so prevalent in American Christianity that
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.480]   if only the church would stand up and do this, we could win back our culture.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   If only the church would do this or that or the other thing, you're sick of inflation,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.360]   you're sick of open borders, you're sick of rainbow flags on your elementary school teachers'
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   lapels.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.560]   Well, if only the church would stand up and be the church, we could bring a stop to that.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   And there's this contradiction in so much of American Christianity that the United States
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.800]   is a nation under judgment by God for our conduct and at the same time, the church has
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.320]   the power to stop that judgment or to avoid that judgment or to direct society in a different
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   direction.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800]   And you can see that those two are in conflict with each other.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.720]   Either we're under the judgment of God or we're not.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.080]   How do you engage with people that are under God's judgment?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   Of course, you preach the gospel to them and appeal for repentance.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.080]   Augustine comes along and says, "The spiritual condition of a society is disconnected from
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.800]   the rise and fall of the city of man."
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.200]   Nations come and nations go and the word of the Lord lives forever.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.840]   And you cannot, as a Christian, try to manipulate that or direct that.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.600]   You cannot control the way God causes nations to rise and fall.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.120]   If Augustine couldn't control the rise and fall of Rome, what do you think you're going
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.520]   to do?
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160]   That's the reality behind Augustine's city of God.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.440]   It's in that context today that I want to talk to you about Christian nationalism.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.760]   The title is how you shepherd Christian nationalism or shepherd people through Christian nationalism
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.320]   in an election year, which is like three subtitles in that, but that's fine.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.760]   I thought of that while I was reading Augustine.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.080]   He's the king of 87 subtitles.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.960]   You know, does your church hand out voter guides?
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.800]   Do you have the American flag on the pulpit?
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.360]   Do you organize little buses to take the elderly to go vote and cure their ballots?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.280]   Do you get involved in elections?
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.200]   Do you have people running for office come and speak to your church?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.680]   Do you tell your church to mobilize and get active in order to win over society?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.660]   Do you go after an election as a motivation in your church?
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.600]   And Christian nationalism is rising right now.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   I think there was by and large a consensus that ten years ago it was waning, that it
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.340]   was on the decline, but then COVID comes and churches get closed and, you know, the borders
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.120]   get opened and inflation goes up and you have the kind of the so-called evangelical elites
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   that sat back and seemed to cheer all of that on, didn't they?
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.040]   They seemed to rejoice in the open borders and they seemed to rejoice in the churches
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   being closed.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.600]   And when you have groups like the ERLC and other groups like that that are really celebrating
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   restrictions on church, you have a lot of people in your own churches, I'm sure, that
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.560]   are looking at that and going, "Our Christian leaders, our religious leaders are selling
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.280]   us out.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.900]   There has to be a better way to navigate this."
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.440]   And so they're drawn to people that are talking with conviction and clarity in the political
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   world.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.800]   At least that has been my experience.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.360]   The people that I have met in the last few years have been drawn towards Christian nationalism.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.240]   That's what's drawn them that way is they think, you know, it used to be, even five
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.560]   years ago, it was just in Christianese, when you were asked a layperson in your church
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.880]   to pray before a meal at a church potluck or before an evening service or whatever,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.760]   and they weren't prepared, they would get up behind the pulpit or behind the casserole
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.120]   and they would start their prayer by saying, "God, we're thankful that we live in a country
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.760]   that is free and lets us meet here without restrictions and we don't take that for granted
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.920]   and thank God for the casserole."
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.080]   And you don't hear those prayers anymore, do you?
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   And the people that used to pray them are looking around going, "What happened?"
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.120]   And they're being drawn towards Christian nationalism.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   So of course any discussion on Christian nationalism has to begin with definitions.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.520]   How do you define Christian nationalism?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.200]   I'll start there.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:46.520]   If you ask NPR, which I don't recommend, a Christian nationalist is anyone who is to
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.840]   the right of Justice Sotomayor.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:58.880]   A Christian nationalist is anyone who is pro-life, has a Bible, a Jesus fish on their car, or
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.080]   has voted Republican in the last 20 years.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.000]   Would make you a Christian nationalist.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   Not a very helpful definition.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.520]   If you ask somebody like Al Mohler, he defines, he describes himself as a Christian nationalist.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.960]   The definition he operates from is kind of just the two words exist independently of
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   each other.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.000]   And Mohler's lexicon, nationalism, is the belief that there are nations and that nations
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.400]   should generally speaking look out for their own interests above other nations.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.120]   That's just a larger political theory.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.480]   Christian is attaching the word Christian to that.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.560]   There's nations that look out for their own interests and some of those nations are Christian
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   and Mohler would clarify that that's by their Judeo-Christian heritage, the Anglo-Protestant
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.200]   legal tradition is the phrase Mohler often uses that Western civilization has come out
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.360]   of this Anglo-Protestant tradition from the Reformation forward that has given us common
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.680]   law, the notion of common law, and the sense of liberty and democracy and all of that.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.040]   And that's what he means by Christian nationalism.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.720]   And I think Mohler's description of Christian nationalism makes so much more sense if you
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.040]   just take it out and substitute the word conservatism.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   When he talks about it, he really means conservative, not in like conserving, slowing down the cultural
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.040]   decline, but in recognizing that there's a legal tradition that stretches back hundreds
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.080]   of years that is the basis of liberty and democracy and we should embrace that legal
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080]   tradition.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   And that's fine and well.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   I mean, that's fully compatible with every statement of faith that is probably represented
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   in this room.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   There's nothing overly controversial with that form of Christian nationalism.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.520]   And so that's not my desire to critique that form of Christian nationalism at all for lots
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   of reasons.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.880]   But the form of Christian nationalism that is more prevalent in our churches, in my experience,
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.200]   that is more dangerous in our churches, and is probably why you're here today, is much
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.940]   more of the active form of nationalism, the call for some kind of Christian prince or
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.320]   Christian leader to engage in leadership in our nation, to galvanize the church, and to
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.080]   see some kind of melding of the church-state relationship.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.160]   I'm thinking of, I brought this up for show and tell today, The Case for Christian Nationalism
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   by Stephen Wolf.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.480]   This is a, it's a long book.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.320]   It's very well written and well researched and it's had an outsized impact on a lot of
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.600]   our churches as people have read it and they're reading it and they're being drawn to the
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.200]   answers that he's offering, that there's hope in the church by placing this desire to see
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.180]   a reformation inside of government and see our nation linked with a kind of Christian
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.180]   nationalism.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.320]   Wolf, in this book, defines Christian nationalism as, quote, "The totality of national action
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.280]   consisting of civil laws and social customs conducted by a Christian nation as a Christian
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   nation to procure for itself both earthly and heavenly good in Christ."
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.560]   So it's a, it's a detailed definition.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.600]   It's a little bit circular.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.380]   His version of Christian nationalism is basically things the Christian nation does.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.760]   So it becomes a little bit circular, but when you go through his understanding of Christian
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.240]   nationalism and what is appealing to people about it, it's very much an active role from
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.060]   the government in propagating the Christian faith.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.280]   It's this idea that the government is, has an active command of God or an active duty
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.360]   from God to propagate the Christian faith, to guard the church from heretics, to rebuke
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.980]   slothful or lazy ministers, to summon church synods and councils, to clarify statements
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:29.280]   of faith, to fund missions, to have oversight and general sense of the church of God on
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.440]   earth.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.000]   Say it in a way that I think would honor Wolf's larger argument in most of the Christian nationalism
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.640]   books that I have read.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.040]   They would argue the government has a role in fostering true religion, in keeping the
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.760]   church accountable, in guarding them from heretics.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.680]   The core of that form of Christian nationalism is the idea that a nation properly expressed
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.840]   exists of one ethnicity and ethnicity there is almost a synonym for nation.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   Wolf would say, you know, there's some differences between them, but as I read him, he defines
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.400]   a nation properly constituted as existing of only one ethnicity, and that ethnicity
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.960]   is a shared culture, language, values, traditions, calendars, you know, foods and social customs
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.000]   and all of that.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.080]   And then Christian nationalism is a nation that is deliberately and intentionally Christian
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.400]   in those holidays, Christian in those rituals where a government guards the Sabbath and
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.840]   facilitates church worship on the Sabbath is an example he often uses.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.680]   And again, rebukes slothful ministers and has oversight in a general sense of the church.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   In this form of Christian nationalism, the political leader, in a sense, is the protector
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.600]   of the church.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.620]   The political leader in this kind of Christian nationalism is not a pastor.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.260]   He's not doing the sacraments or the ordinances.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.260]   He's not preaching.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.600]   He's not baptizing babies in this form of Christian nationalism.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:00.160]   He's not doing those things, but he's keeping watch over it.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.800]   That has an appeal to our current generation of evangelicals, especially younger people
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.720]   who are drawn towards kind of an authoritative protector of the church when they see, as
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.920]   I mentioned earlier, a previous generation of people who were to be protecting the church
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.440]   have kind of abdicated their responsibilities.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.040]   I won't drag you through all of this book, but I did just to let you know where I'm going.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.000]   I have four critiques of this form of Christian nationalism, not just this book, but that
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.700]   form of Christian nationalism that are philosophical, and then I have five critiques that are theological.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700]   So that's where I'm headed.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.180]   I want to critique this view of Christian nationalism from a philosophical perspective
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.880]   or kind of just like reading the book and saying, "Here's four things that I really
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.920]   don't like, and then I'll give you five theological reasons that you should not be a Christian
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.680]   nationalist."
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.940]   That's where we're headed.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.160]   So first of all, I will say this, there are some good things in this kind of Christian
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   nationalism.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   There are some good things.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.800]   The way he esteems parts of our country's past kind of Christian heritage, the way he
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.920]   defends Mayberry.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.320]   There's a section in this book where he defends Mayberry like, "Don't you wish your kids could
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.360]   grow up in the kind of cul-de-sac where they can play with their neighbors, and you don't
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.520]   have to know where your 10-year-old is 24/7."
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.800]   There's a kind of wholesomeness that's there that he feels like we've lost, and not only
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.480]   have we lost it, but you have people that had criticized it, that spent decades criticizing
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.360]   the Christian cultures, creating false morality, and Pharisees, and Christian culture are bad,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.880]   it interferes with the gospel.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.640]   And so now everybody's listening to them, and now we've lost that culture, and we've
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.840]   lost Mayberry, and we've lost the cul-de-sac where kids can play in, and all of that.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.920]   So I do appreciate that about his book, along with other things as well.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.400]   But I do want to clearly say my four big concerns with the book from a philosophical perspective.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.720]   First of all, it idolizes the past.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.840]   It idolizes the past.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:56.240]   He calls on Christians to kind of bring a restoration to our nation's own Christian
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   past.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.360]   He describes it as, quote, "a recovery of a former shared Christian ethic and ethnic
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.360]   tradition and heritage."
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.680]   And when you start describing it like that, it forces you to reexamine the past.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.240]   It forces you to ask a question, was our nation founded properly as a Christian nation?
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.720]   Was there a period in our nation's past where we really did function like a Christian nation?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.840]   Once you start using the language of recovery, it's appropriate to ask, what are you recovering,
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.560]   and where are you looking for it?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.360]   You know, what are you retrieving from the past?
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.560]   Not everything that you retrieve from the past is good.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.720]   Sometimes your golden retriever brings back a dead squirrel.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.500]   You didn't want that.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.000]   So what exactly is being retrieved from the past?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.040]   And you would ask yourself, was there a time in the U.S. history that it was functioning
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.560]   as a Christian kind of nation or culture?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.920]   And it's very difficult to identify that time.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.940]   I mean, I dare you.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.080]   Start naming a decade where you're like, that's where we had a Christian culture.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.600]   And here's a thought experiment for you.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.960]   You would think of that and go back to that decade and ask yourself, the Christian leaders
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.440]   and pastors and ministers who were around back then, what did they say about the culture
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   when they were there?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.600]   You know, Al Mohler often goes to the 1960s.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.440]   That's where everything changed, he said, you know.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.920]   1961, Democrats and Republicans basically were the same when it came to social issues.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   And the sexual revolution comes, the wheels come off the car and, you know, here we are.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.320]   But go back in your mind to that era of world history or American history and ask yourself,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.880]   what did the leaders of that day say about American Christianity?
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.240]   Evolution was on the rise.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.360]   This is the decline of inerrancy, the attack on the fundamentals of the faith.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:46.280]   This is the era where Martin Lloyd-Jones lamented American culture, particularly for its materialism,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.920]   its embracing of liberalism, the racism that was rampant back then.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.600]   All of that is worthy of substantial critique.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.100]   Or you go back further, okay, the 1800s there.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.180]   Certainly that was the Christian zenith, the 1800s, before all of liberalism, before evolution
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.400]   became a thing, when the denominations were rocking and you got evangelists preaching
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.760]   in the streets, like that's where you're at.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.320]   And then you go and read Spurgeon about that time period.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.200]   Christian George's introduction of the Lost Sermons of Spurgeon has some quotes of Spurgeon
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.440]   about the United States then.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.840]   He called the American culture of the 1800s, quote, "shameful and abominable, abhorrent
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   and bloodthirsty."
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.360]   And he said that unless the United States was punished with a graphic and brutal civil
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.200]   war, then the kind of justice he associates with God must not really exist.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.160]   Spurgeon did not mince his words when it came to the United States.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.560]   And largely Spurgeon's critique was over slavery and race relations, which he didn't excuse
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   England from either.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   He said, quote, "if slavery would not have come to the United States had it not been
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   carried there from Manchester and Liverpool," he understood his own nation's complicity
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   in that.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.600]   Nevertheless, he critiqued the American culture for its bloodthirsty and shameful and abominable
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   ways.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.520]   I mean, you can go back all the way to the United States founding and think about what
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.920]   the evangelists of that era said about our culture.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.960]   Think of the kind of things that are in our founding from the Revolution forward.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.640]   Even, you know, the religious test clause in the Constitution.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.440]   You can't have a religious test for government service.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   It's in our Constitution.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.740]   That's not the kind of thing that you would put in your Constitution if you were deliberately
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.220]   constructing a Christian nation.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.300]   And to prove that, you could ask any of the Christian nationalists you see today, in your
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.320]   view of Christian nationalism, should unbelievers be allowed to have high seats in the government?
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.680]   Of course, it's antithetical to what they're putting forward.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.400]   You know, the truth is our country wasn't founded by that concept of Christian nationalism.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.840]   Obviously, there's an Anglo-Protestant legal tradition in our country.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.280]   There's a form of liberty.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.120]   There's a form of God providing rights to us, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.180]   all men are created equal kind of language.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.160]   You can't say people are created equal unless you believe that there's a creator.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.200]   I mean, that's just straightforward right there.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   That's obviously in our country's fast, but our country chose the route of e pluribus
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.360]   unum, not in Christosolis.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.160]   You know, we chose to embrace multiple ethnicities, multiple cultures, and amalgamate them into
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.560]   one nation rather than to say that we are a nation of a distinct Christian ethnic identity.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.120]   It's also not the 1619 Project.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   My point is that at no point in America's history did we have really a Christian culture,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.880]   the kind of which that is argued for by proponents of Christian nationalism.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.480]   My second concern about this form of Christian nationalism is that, first of all, it idealizes
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.120]   the past, but second, it impossibilizes the present.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.640]   Impossibilizes is not a real word, but it's going to fit with my outline, and I'm a preacher
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.160]   more than I am an English major.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.360]   It impossibilizes the present.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   It presents an ideal for people that draws them in that is impossible to obtain.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.360]   Wolfe says that Christian nationalism has never truly been experienced in our country,
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.600]   but that's almost, he reads as if he's saying it's because we haven't tried enough.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.400]   We haven't sought to put it into place with enough effort.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.140]   In other words, all that's missing is willpower, but the truth is that's not what's missing
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.140]   in our country.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.680]   It's not a matter of the church standing up and being the church and getting more of your
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.960]   congregation to vote and finally take our country back.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.560]   That's not it at all.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   The problem in our own country is that we're just dealing with a numbers game.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.400]   The way is narrow that leads to life.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.920]   If you're dealing in a democracy, the majority wins, and the church, the true church, is
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.840]   never going to be the majority.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.320]   We're dealing in a culture now that is what is often called the negative world for Christianity,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.080]   and that language I think is helpful.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.440]   Before the 1960s, Christianity had more or less a positive connotation in our culture.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.120]   From the 1960s to 2010 or so, it had a neutral connotation.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   In other words, if you wanted to excel in politics in the 1940s or '50s, you probably
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.400]   had to be a church member.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.320]   From the 1960s to 2010, it didn't matter.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.480]   You could be or you didn't have to be.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.800]   Nobody really cared, but now it's a detriment.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   Now it's a negative association with you.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.640]   If you want to rise in society, being associated with the church has a negative impact on you,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.520]   so it's hard to make that jive with this idea of Christian nationalism that if only the
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.780]   majority of people would rise up and reclaim their Christian identity if you're functioning
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.720]   in a society with a negative view of Christianity.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.360]   The reality is that we are the remnant.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:32.620]   I mean, I even think back to what presidential election was in the 2000s where Rick Warren
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.080]   moderated the debates.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.260]   Do you remember that?
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.720]   He moderated a presidential debate.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.320]   Could you imagine today?
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.000]   And he got lambasted for it even back then for being too, you know, too Christian and
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.800]   what's President Obama doing in this age with Rick Warren, of all people.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.760]   The whole thing just seems comical in retrospect.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.680]   It's such a different world even from now.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.240]   The truth is the church is the remnant.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.600]   The church is the remnant.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.440]   And when you start angling for a victory at the box office, that makes you at the ballot
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.840]   box -- California football right there -- if you're angling for a victory at the ballot
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.560]   box, it forces you to make coalitions and partnerships and political alliances to drum
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.880]   up a majority.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.760]   That's the way politics works.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.680]   If you're going to lobby for a certain measure to be passed, you have to partner with the
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   Catholic church.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.760]   You have to partner with the Mormon church, what's so called.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.120]   You have to partner with all of the different groups to get it across the finish line because
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.920]   the objective is political.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.640]   In our culture today, the church cannot advance something that far.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.920]   If you take the Benedict option as your political model that you're going to, you know, retreat
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.960]   and make your own Christian society, don't be surprised if you have to partner with Benedictine
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   monks.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.440]   That's how that strategy works.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.040]   Now for law issues, that's fine.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.440]   You know, to pass pro-life legislation for issues of law where the government is checking
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.400]   evil pro-life legislation, school vouchers, that kind of stuff that is law issues, it's
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.000]   fine to be co-belligerents with people that aren't Christians.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   That's fine.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.200]   But not for gospel issues.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.560]   Gospel issues, there's an exclusivity of it.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.040]   You're not a co-belligerent in a gospel issue with people that aren't regenerates.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.120]   But in Christian nationalism, that divide gets erased.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.800]   And the way it's presented, as I read this form of Christian nationalism, it presents
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.680]   a union between law and gospel issues both under the general authority of the government
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.320]   which requires a kind of partnership that erodes gospel distinctives.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.080]   The majority of a nation will never be able to institutionalize true religion.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   That's the problem.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   What's missing from all these books about Christian nationalism is examples of this
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.880]   kind of government actually having occurred in church history.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.840]   And that's because the majority is generally wrong, the true church is the minority, and
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.080]   at some point you just have to ask yourself, what am I supposed to do?
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.520]   If I believe in Christian nationalism, I want to be a Christian nationalist, let's roll,
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   let's go do this thing, let's do it.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.400]   What do I do now?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.280]   Vote harder?
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   Press the button harder?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   Harder?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.480]   I'm running out of options here.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.320]   Get my neighbor to press the button?
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.800]   I mean, you're in California, how many people you got to get to vote here to make a difference?
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.040]   It just makes it an impossible situation.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.840]   My third concern with Christian nationalism, it idealizes the past, it impossibilizes the
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   present.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.960]   Thirdly, it institutionalizes the church.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.240]   It institutionalizes the church.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.520]   The classic Baptist political theory has a separation of church and state, and by separation
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.080]   of church and state, of course we don't mean it as it's often used today, but more of the
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.240]   classic two-kingdom theology.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.760]   There's a civil magistrate that rules the civil affairs of the world, the law category
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.680]   in the world, and there is the church that has ecclesiastical oversight that oversees
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.240]   the souls.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.160]   This form of Christian nationalism erodes that distinction by institutionalizing the
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.280]   church, by giving the government oversight and authority in the realm of the church.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   I think it's helpful to think through how this develops, you know, Augustine's approach,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.320]   the city of God and the city of man, when Augustine's using that language, he doesn't
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.560]   mean by the city of man, government, and the city of God, church, he meant really like
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.460]   your hopes and how you're partnering with people.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.720]   It maps onto government really well, but he means more or less that non-Christians are
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.760]   the city of man.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.760]   But that developed in the Catholic church to what's called the doctrine of the two swords.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.280]   In the Catholic church, you have really two spheres, you have the kingdom of man, ruled
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.360]   by kings and presidents and whatever, and then you have the kingdom of the church, ruled
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.320]   by the church, and the doctrine of the two swords, it's one person who holds both swords.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.440]   One person who has oversight of both, that's the pope in the Roman Catholic church.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.040]   Well, that's been morphed over time to this idea in Catholicism where the actual political
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.840]   leadership is more of a hands-off kind of association, you have the king of England,
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.580]   he's the oversight of the church really, but not really, he protects it, he's the protector
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.320]   of the church, but he's not really the head of the church, even though that's what the
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.840]   documents might say.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.600]   That's the classic doctrine of the two swords.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.400]   The Puritan tradition went a different way.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.580]   The Puritan legal tradition went separately and said you have two kingdoms, but let's
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.520]   keep them separate from each other.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.120]   We don't want one person ruling the church and one person ruling the state.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   That would be bad.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   There has to be distinctions.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.520]   And granted, in early Puritan history, those distinctions were somewhat unfortunate.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.280]   Like when you think of the kind of church-state separation that some of the Puritans had like
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.920]   John Owen or Samuel Willard or people like that, I mean, it was often the church IDs
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.080]   the heretics and the government kills them.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.860]   That was their view of separation of church and state.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.200]   They told the government, "Would you stop calling people heretics?
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Let us do that."
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.240]   And the government tells the church, "Okay, would you stop killing them?
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   Let us do that."
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.240]   Great.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   Deal.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.760]   Let's roll.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.360]   We've moved on from that, of course, but you should have sympathy for some of those guys.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.760]   You know, Samuel Willard, he's called to testify at the Salem witch trials.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.040]   There's somebody on trial for being a witch and the judge says, "What did the pastor say?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   Call him up.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Bring the pastor.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   Swear him in.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   Are there witches?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   What should we do to him?"
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   I mean, how would you respond to that?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.400]   It's just, again, such a different world that we're in now.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.640]   But that was the idea of separation of church and state.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:13.600]   Christian identity, Christian nationalism often melds those and brings them back together.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.840]   To use, I think, their own terminology, I would say that the state should be overseeing
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.380]   the law and not the gospel.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.040]   You don't want to give the state the gospel also.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.600]   The state or the government messes everything up, don't they?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.520]   Have you ever encountered something the government's done well?
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.320]   And this is hard for me pastoring in DC because when I use the word government, it's like
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   the people.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   They're in front of me at the pews.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   I'm like, "The government's awful."
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.960]   And they're like, "Hey, I stayed late on Friday.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   Back off."
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:49.480]   You know, it was Reagan, right, who said the nine most frightening words in the English
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   language.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   "I'm from the government and I'm here to help."
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.880]   There's some truth to that.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.760]   Would you want to shift gospel implications and church oversight and the power to rebuke
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.880]   slothful ministers and whatnot over to a category of people that don't do their own obligations
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.200]   well?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.160]   You want them to have more power and power in the realm of the church?
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.920]   Please no.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   Please no.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.840]   You know, you want the government to be able to get power to the church to turn the lights
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   on.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.960]   To have the water come out of the faucet.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   Those kind of things.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.000]   You don't want them to oversee the ordinances of the church.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.960]   Fourthly, my first concern is that Christian nationalism idealizes the past.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.880]   The second, it impossibilizes the present.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.120]   Thirdly, it institutionalizes the church.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.640]   Fourthly, it idolizes ethnicity.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.060]   It idolizes ethnicity.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.680]   And forgive me for reading now because I want to stay close to my words.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.520]   Overall this desire, and presented in books like this, is a desire to guard ethnic heritage.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.920]   And they use the language of ethnicity, not the language of race.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.640]   We understand that we are all one race.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   There's not multiple races.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.620]   Race is a biological fiction, granted.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:07.660]   In their world, they embrace this concept of ethnicity to describe certain shared cultural
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.660]   features.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.940]   But then they argue that every nation, properly comprised, is made up of only one ethnicity.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.900]   And as I mentioned earlier, that's just not the route that the United States took.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.780]   The United States deliberately was designed with multiple ethnicities embraced inside
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:32.060]   of its borders, from Spanish Catholics to, you know, the Dutch to the slaves to the Puritans
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.860]   and everyone in between.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.420]   You know, the founding of New Mexico predates the founding of Plymouth Rock.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.140]   Do we count as properly constituted in the United States?
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:49.060]   And I use the word "idolize ethnicity" because so much of this argument hinges on putting
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.700]   ethnicity back into the Garden of Eden and seeing it before the fall.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   A lot of these Christian nationalist arguments hinge on the idea that governments and ethnic
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.460]   divisions would have happened without the fall in the world.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.580]   Had no sin entered in the world, there still would have been government because people
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.060]   on one part of the stream need the water for farming and people on another part of the
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.660]   stream need it for, you know, cooling metals or whatever.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.740]   And so they're going to have to, even though there's no sin, they're going to have to break
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.740]   up into different government divisions to regulate the shared use of resources and that
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.940]   over time will have cultural implications.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.660]   So it's this desire to put ethnic distinctions and government back before the fall.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:31.060]   And that's why I use the word "idolize" because if you have such a care and a hope in something
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.900]   that is important to you, it existed in a sinless world, it might be an idol.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.020]   It might be an idol.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:44.380]   Of course, they would stay away from the concept of race, as I mentioned earlier, yet so much
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.440]   of their description of ethnicity has racial overtones to it, which leads to all kinds
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   of clumsiness.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.380]   In a lot of the Christian national circles, there's, you know, debates over are interethnic
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.380]   marriages appropriate?
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.740]   You know, and I've heard some of these Christian leaders say, you know, interethnic marriages
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.220]   are, you know, marriages between people of two different ethnicities are not wise because
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.700]   your kids will be confused, they won't know, you know, where their people are, they won't
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.460]   know what their culture is, they're just, you're setting them up to lose if they're
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:17.580]   part of the fruit of an interethnic marriage and it's just, it's sad, really, the way it's
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.580]   described.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.780]   And I've heard one of the leaders say, there's a category for a marriage between people of
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.060]   different ethnicities.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   It's not gay marriage.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.680]   Gay marriage is no marriage at all, but it's closer to a marriage between a believer and
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   an unbeliever.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.980]   It's unwise and it's foolish and it's not going to be good, but it's still a valid marriage.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:41.420]   I'm hearing that going, wow, thanks, you know, if you're married to someone who's not your
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:46.060]   ethnicity, it's in the category of a foolish marriage to a non-believer.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.700]   It's just unhelpful and very confusing language and, of course, when they're criticized for
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.360]   that, they always say, but you're not using the word ethnicity the right way.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.420]   Well, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm trying to use it the right way.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   I've read all the reading.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   I've done all the books.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   Like, I've really done my homework.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.500]   I'm trying to use it like you're using it and it seems like you're defining ethnicity
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.740]   as shared culture, shared values, shared language, shared traditions, foods, and all of that.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.980]   I got a concept for that and people marry from different ethnic groups and, you know,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.860]   there's a society that you should freeze all kind of marriages outside of your own nation
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.380]   or language group or whatever for a period of time until our country sorts itself out
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.740]   and has its own ethnicity that's kind of recovered from the inside out.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.740]   And it's just really insane, honestly, and it's so different in the way the Bible describes
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.740]   Christians with ethnicity.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.740]   Isn't it?
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.660]   I mean, the Bible doesn't speak of Christian ethnicity like that.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.260]   The Bible does use the term ethnicity for Christians, of course, but we are a holy priesthood.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.580]   We are our own kind of nation, so to speak.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.180]   So to elevate culture or ethnicity to where you're like, "Oh, it's a close call of two
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.340]   people from different ethnic groups should get married.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.580]   It's just such a close call," shows that you've really lost touch with the overarching force
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.740]   of ethnicity in the Bible.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.460]   The New Testament does not give the church the mandate of preserving ethnic groups but
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.660]   of transforming them with the gospel.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.100]   That's the great commission.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.940]   So those are my concerns.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.780]   Christian nationalism, presented by Wolf and other Christian nationalists, idealizes the
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.980]   past and possibleizes the present, institutionalizes the church, and idolizes ethnicity.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.460]   Now here's my theological concern.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.820]   So this is the part where I want to convince you, you're like, "Okay, I get that, but still,
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.300]   can I be a Christian nationalist if I don't, you know, for other reasons?"
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:32.100]   And so here's why Christian nationalism is just frankly not compatible with premillennialism,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.380]   not compatible with the Baptist worldview, not compatible with what I would consider
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.380]   proper theology.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.940]   So that's the first reason.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:46.060]   Christian nationalism presents the partnership of government and church in a confusing way,
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.420]   and I'll give you five of these ways.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.540]   First of all, those two groups have different covenants.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:55.540]   Government and nations have a different covenant than the church.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:02.100]   The origin of government -- I know the word covenant makes some of you uneasy.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.340]   The origin of government is from the Noahic covenant.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.980]   Government comes from God entering the world after the flood and telling Noah, first of
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.100]   all, there's animals for you to eat, there's a food source involved, be fruitful and multiply,
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.140]   which is, you know, goes back to the garden, but then God adds, "Whoever sheds man's blood
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.960]   by man's hand shall his blood be shed," and God gives the sword to the world to punish
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   evildoers.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.180]   This is the origins of government.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.100]   Government comes into the world through the Noahic covenant to check evil, and this is
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.980]   how government is often ascribed throughout the rest of Scripture.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.940]   After government instituted, the nations go their own way.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.720]   That's the language of Acts 17.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.060]   God allowed the nations to go their own way.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:45.800]   He appoints from one man every nation of mankind to live, speaking of Noah, on all the face
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.020]   of the earth, having determined the allotted periods and boundaries of their dwelling place.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.900]   In the days of Peleg, the nations divided and they shifted from each other, and Paul
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.820]   says God did this so that people one day might grope their way back to the gospel.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.980]   One day they might encounter Christ.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.660]   So God designed nations.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.460]   He designed them to go their own way, but to bear the sword to check evil.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.500]   They were designed by God.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.700]   God invented nations, not in the Garden of Eden, but after the flood, and He did not
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:19.740]   tell nations that their job was to promote true religion, or to check evil, I mean, not
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:24.500]   to promote true religion, but to check evil, to protect life, and to protect family.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.700]   In Christian nationalism, there's a syllogism that they often use.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.860]   The syllogism is that civil government ought to direct its people to true religion.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.820]   Christianity is the true religion, therefore civil government should direct people to Christianity.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.020]   Do you follow that logic?
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.380]   And so what's the problem with that?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.140]   And not every syllogism is, you know, valid, of course.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.300]   You know, people with two legs can run a marathon.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.660]   I have two legs, therefore I can run a marathon.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.380]   Something broke down in that syllogism.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.220]   Civil government's obligation is to promote the true religion.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.180]   That's where it breaks down.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:10.340]   Did God design civil government with the obligation to promote true religion?
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.860]   I say He did not.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.380]   The Noahic Covenant is not a redemptive covenant.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.660]   The Noahic Covenant restrains wrath.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.940]   It says as long as the rainbow is there, I'm not going to, you know, flood the earth again.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.980]   There's universal judgment is coming.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.420]   God will destroy the earth, but the rainbow, in a sense, holds it back.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.720]   The rainbow does not prophesy a Redeemer.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.940]   The rainbow hangs in the sky, but it doesn't have blood on it.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.540]   There's no blood of the lamb in the rainbow.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.940]   That's a covenant that restrains evil.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.740]   Much like government, which comes in as part of this covenant, is designed to check evil
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.740]   and restrain it.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.940]   The government does not produce the Savior.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.700]   Government doesn't even point to the Savior.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.740]   The nations go their own way, because one day the Savior will come independent of them
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.540]   through God's special nation, Israel, through the Abrahamic Covenant.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.900]   The Savior will come through that, through the Davidic Covenant.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.300]   He'll be a king from that line.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.680]   But He doesn't come as a fulfillment of the Noahic Covenant.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.360]   He comes so the nations that went their own way, founded by God in the Noahic Covenant,
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.180]   can grow up their own way and find Him.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.060]   It's just categorically different.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:15.900]   The church, meanwhile, comes on the foundation of the new covenant, that Jesus was resurrected
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.980]   from the grave, on the basis of the blood of an eternal covenant.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   And we now have a church that's based in the new covenant that is going to the nations.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.740]   It transcends national divisions, transcends ethnic divisions, bringing the gospel to the
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.740]   world.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.940]   It's categorically different than the nations.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:39.780]   So this idea that the two, the nations and church, have some kind of union under the
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.980]   common administration of government, is so flawed.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.380]   It's so flawed.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.740]   They have different designs.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.340]   They're from different covenants.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.740]   That means they have different goals.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.140]   The goal of the nation is not to promote the true religion.
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.620]   The goal of the nation is to check evil and make sure there's peace.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.180]   That's what a good government does.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.420]   You want a good government that punishes evildoers, throws them in jail, and promotes the corporate
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.380]   well-being of the people through common peace.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.100]   It's the church's job to promote the true religion.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:15.060]   If everybody would stay in their own lanes, things would be so much better.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.980]   Don't remove those lane lines.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.420]   They have different goals.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.940]   Because they have different goals, they have a different focus.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.400]   The focus of the church is the mediator of the new covenant, the Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   Christ.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.960]   The focus of government is the common peace of the people.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.460]   And because they have a different focus, they have different agents.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.040]   The government agents bear the sword to check evil.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.800]   The Christian agents, I mean, are the ministers of the gospel, the priesthood of all believers
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.680]   through the mediatorial role of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.640]   And because they have different agents, they have different laws.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:55.040]   The government operates from common grace, natural law, general revelation, which of
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.720]   course is flawed because of sin.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.240]   And there's the prophetic voice of believers that tell people, "Hey, homosexuality is wrong
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.420]   and transgenderism is wrong.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.640]   We use our prophetic voice."
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.000]   So those kinds of things are deducible from just natural revelation and human reasoning.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.840]   That's very different than the law that binds the church together.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.440]   The kind of commands that the New Testament gives for the church are not given to nations.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.400]   The commands you see to nations, like Romans 13 style, are the same thing nations were
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.600]   told back in Genesis 8.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.800]   There's not new commands in Genesis 9.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.860]   There's not new commands in the church, I mean, in the New Testament to nations.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.560]   But all of the structuring of the church is brand new in the New Testament.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.980]   So nations have their origin long before the church in time.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.040]   They have, because of that, different goals, different focus, different agents, different
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.600]   laws, different ethnicity.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.320]   Nations, if you want to grant the case, which I don't.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.640]   But if you want to grant the case, which again I don't, but if you want to for the sake of
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.460]   argument that every nation should have only one ethnicity, okay, whatever.
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.440]   It's just different how the church works.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.200]   The church, a multi-ethnic church is a glorious thing.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.000]   It celebrates the transcendent power of the gospel.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.480]   If you say a multi-ethnic nation is prone to divisions and divides and race riots and
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   all that, okay, whatever.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.600]   I'm not even that interested in that argument.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   I'll grant it for the sake of discussion.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.160]   The church is so different.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.320]   The more diverse the church is, the more glorious the gospel that's presented in the churches.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.560]   That's why a multi-ethnic church can be a wonderful sense of the transcendent power
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.680]   of the gospel.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.600]   And so if you're coming and looking at that, like a multi-ethnic church and you're looking
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.780]   at that and you're going, "Wow, that celebrates the glories of the gospel," and somebody else
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.960]   comes along, "Yeah, but that's not good for civic identity.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.720]   That confuses civic identity."
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.120]   You're painting a civic goal that is at odds with a religious goal.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   And that's a problem.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.380]   That's a problem.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.680]   When you're turning something that's positive, namely the transcendent power of the gospel
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.800]   is present in a multi-ethnic church, into a negative, a threat to social cohesion and
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.160]   identity, you're doing something wrong.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:03.480]   In fact, I have a definition from Stephen Wolfe of ethnicity.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.920]   He says, "Ethnicity is," and listen to this so carefully, "familiarity with others based
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.880]   on common language, manners, customs, stories, taboos, rituals, calendars, social expectations,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.320]   duties, loves, and religions."
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.520]   I love that definition.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.320]   That's the church.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.400]   We have our common language.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   We have Christianese.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   I made fun of it earlier.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   Do you remember?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.400]   We have Christianese.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   We have common taboos.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.680]   We have common calendars and rituals and ordinances or sacraments, whatever word you want to describe
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   it.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.240]   We're bound together by a common entity.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   That's the church.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:45.080]   And if you say a nation is only properly composed of one ethnicity, I object.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   I object.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.040]   And because they have all those different things, they have different ends.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.160]   The end of the city of man is not good.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   God will judge it.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.200]   It will burn away.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.520]   The end of the city of God is triumph.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.160]   It's triumph.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.640]   Now in Christian nationalism, they would grant a distinction between the city of man and
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   the city of God.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.760]   They would grant a distinction between government and church.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.960]   They would grant all those.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.840]   But I'm saying that in Christian nationalism, as I read it, while they would say they function
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.140]   with different ordinances and all of this, while they would say they have those differences,
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.560]   they conflate them.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.480]   They argue that you should have a Christian prince that leads the Christian nation.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.320]   A Christian prince who aspires to rule justly and who doesn't long for power for its own
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.280]   sake, who will fund missions and restrain heretics and can mediate any problems with
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.640]   wisdom and an almost omniscient grace.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.120]   That's their description of the Christian prince.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.480]   And I'm reading that description going, yeah, please tell me that's Jesus.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.120]   Please, is that, because you just described him.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.140]   A glorious ruler who's practically omniscient, who knows how to handle every problem and
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.200]   bring societal peace.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.280]   I want that person.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   I want him to be my king.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.080]   Is that who you're talking about?
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   No.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   No.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.360]   Well, shucks, because I'm looking at the people on the ballot and I don't see that guy.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:06.520]   All right, so my first theological concern is the two nations are rooted in different
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.200]   covenants, which produced all those other differences.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.400]   Secondly, they have different law.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.600]   They have different law.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.560]   Political authorities make and enforce laws that are grounded in the Noahic covenant to
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.340]   promote the common peace.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.580]   In the church, there's nothing like that.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.320]   There's no new covenant commands to the church about how to make laws for the common good
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.440]   in society.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.560]   The language of the Christian nationalists is don't you want the government to function
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.600]   according to Christian ethics?
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.040]   And they say it like it's, you know, the second class condition in Greek, like the answer
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   should be obvious.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.280]   Obviously, you're a Christian, you want the government to function according to Christian
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   ethics.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.560]   You don't want to just say, "Hold on.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.680]   What ethics are we talking about here?"
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.800]   When you say Christian ethics, what do you mean?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   Do you mean turn the other cheek?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.240]   Do you mean take no vengeance for yourself?
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.080]   Do you mean those kind of ethics?
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.040]   Because no, I don't want the government to do that.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   You hit a police officer.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.520]   I don't want the police officers to say, "Brother, sermon on the mount style.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.000]   Hit the other cheek."
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.320]   Romans 12, don't take vengeance on people.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   Let the Lord do that.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.440]   Imagine if you tried to have a government that lived out that Christian ethic.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.960]   In fact, Romans 13 comes with the government bearing the sword.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.200]   If you want the Romans 12 ethic, you need the Romans 13 government or it will not work.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   The reason you can turn the other cheek when somebody hits you is because the police are
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.400]   not far behind.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:47.120]   It's so important to see those two spheres operating.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   There's some overlap, of course.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.440]   You live in both spheres.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.480]   You're a Christian.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.440]   You call 911 and say, "A guy's punching my neighbor."
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.280]   They don't say, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.160]   You know, they just roll in.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.640]   It's different laws.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.000]   And the laws I'm telling you that the God designed government to engage in are rooted
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.800]   in Genesis 8, apply to the nations at large.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.240]   The laws God gave Israel in the Old Testament are different than that for their own particular
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.480]   purpose in the Old Testament, and the instruction in the New Testament does not rewire the nations,
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.500]   but it does rewire the church.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.880]   We derive our ethic from the New Testament teaching of the Lord.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:35.520]   The personal ethics of the new covenant and the kingdom of God go well so much together.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:43.280]   They cleave together so well, and that's not the ethics of a functioning government.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.680]   Number three, they have different covenants, different law.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.360]   Thirdly, they have different obligations.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.640]   As I mentioned, the government's obligation is to punish evil and protect life, to protect
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.780]   the family, to regulate the food sources.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.520]   That's the government's obligation.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.720]   That creates the conditions where true religion thrives.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.620]   True religion thrives in a nation where the government checks evil.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.980]   This is, again, Acts 17.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.640]   God designed the nations to go their own way so that one day they can turn and look for
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   the Savior.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.880]   So government is doing its job when it checks evil.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.760]   The gospel comes in from the inside out.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.640]   You know, missionaries come into the nation.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.520]   The gospel takes root in the nation, and the gospel spreads from there while the government
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.760]   is checking evil.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.560]   The government doesn't promote the propagation of the gospel.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.760]   The government checks evil, and Christians promote the propagation of the gospel.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.880]   They have different obligations.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.880]   The government should not be making decisions based on what's best for Christianity.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.840]   The government should be making decisions based on what is best for the common peace.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:46.140]   And that's largely – you could say it's a distinction without difference, I suppose,
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.580]   but it is different motivations.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:54.380]   And it's important because then you have non-Christian leaders in your governments.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.180]   Non-Christians can be excellent government leaders.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.180]   They really can.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.700]   They can check evil.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.800]   They can refuse bribes.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.920]   They can operate with an ethic that they have achieved from natural revelation for the common
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.460]   good and human reasoning.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   Of course they can.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.180]   That doesn't mean they're redeemed.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.840]   It's the age-old question, would you rather have a competent non-Christian president or
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.580]   an incompetent Christian president?
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.140]   That's why it's kind of superficial to say, you know, if the guy's a Christian, I'll vote
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.140]   for him.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.780]   Well, maybe have some other follow-up questions.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.820]   And if you don't understand that, try owning your own business.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.720]   You know, do you want the 16-year-old who doesn't know what they're doing but is a Christian
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.700]   or the 16-year-old who's like a hard worker and shows up early?
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:42.580]   At least you can evangelize a second one.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.620]   You know, the government takes liberty away from people.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.620]   The government, of course, does that.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.440]   But the government can't grant liberty.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.660]   Liberty comes from God.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.660]   We know that.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.840]   And so that's why I say different obligations.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.280]   The obligation of the government is not to grant you rights or grant you liberty but
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.080]   to make sure they're not taken from you.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:04.320]   The church's job, then, is to come in and preach the gospel to all people making disciples.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.680]   Number four, they have a different identity, a different identity.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.320]   Government identifies as the majority by definition.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   There's the British expression.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.000]   It doesn't matter who wins the election, the government will always take its seat.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.500]   It doesn't matter if the Democrats win, the Republicans win, the government will be in
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   power tomorrow.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.840]   That's just the reality.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.440]   The church is always the minority.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.840]   We have a sojourner identity.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.720]   And that is not just a New Testament reality.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.920]   That is Old Testament as well.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.720]   Think of the sojourner kind of language of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   How did they relate to the world as a sojourner?
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.280]   They entered in contracts with government.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.000]   They subjected themselves to kings and governors and little city council members.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.560]   They bought wells and they bought graves.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.600]   And when they didn't honor the government, they repented, right?
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.760]   When Abraham lied, he repents.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.480]   Isaac lies, he repents.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.400]   But they're engaging with the nation, so to speak.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   Identifying as a sojourner.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.120]   Joseph, even, identifying as a sojourner, even though he's rising in power, even though
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.640]   he practically is the government by the end of Genesis, he's still very clearly a sojourner.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.840]   Daniel, in Babylon, literally in Babylon, not figuratively, literally in Babylon, operating
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.800]   as a sojourner without compromising his own identity.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.320]   That's the pattern for the church.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.880]   And that language is picked up in the New Testament as we are called sojourners.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.440]   So the question is, does the New Testament change your sojourner identity?
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   And the answer is no.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.080]   The New Testament embraces the sojourner identity, embraces our identity as aliens and exiles
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   in this world.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   And so, this is why premillennialism is not compatible with Christian nationalism.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.680]   Even though it's, in the last few weeks, I've seen all kinds of Christian nationalists
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.520]   say, "Eschatology has nothing to do with this.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.560]   You can be a premillennialist and be just happy as a Christian nationalist.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.060]   Come on, we don't care about eschatology.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.880]   Just vote harder."
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:55.320]   But it's so important because in premillennialism, we recognize the sojourner identity of the
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   church.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.240]   In postmillennialism, of course, you're operating an assumption that the gospel's going to grow
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.440]   in a nation until it eventually becomes the predominant culture and ushers in some kind
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.920]   of Christian national identity.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   That's fine.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   That's postmillennialism.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.040]   That's Christian nationalism.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   Go for it.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   That's your thing.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:15.120]   But it's not my thing because of my premillennial convictions about the nature and the identity
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   of the church.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.080]   And that touches on my fifth and final point.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.160]   They have different hopes.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.160]   Different hopes.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.640]   The hope of the city of man is fickle.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.280]   This is where it's so dangerous for our church, brothers.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.480]   Election year is coming up.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:41.080]   The government's going to win.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.960]   And you have people in your congregation.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:48.120]   Their hearts are going to be so drawn to this.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   Right now.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   Let me check what's happening.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.480]   What did Trump do?
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.960]   Their hearts are so drawn to this.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.920]   And they're invested in it.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.560]   And they want to do more.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:03.440]   And you know, you're in a state that hasn't voted red in like, you know, forever.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.640]   And your people's hearts are all wrapped up in this.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.560]   And they're distracted.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.520]   It's too much hope in elections.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.560]   Last presidential election, you know, the election happened on Tuesday.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.400]   And by Sunday, people at church were just like talking about it and talking about it
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   and talking about it.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   And what's going to happen?
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   And the MyPillow guy is on TV.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.480]   And it's the whole thing, remember?
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:35.720]   And so I pulled the car over and I preached Psalm 131, a song of ascents of David.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.440]   Oh, Yahweh, my heart's not lifted up.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.960]   My eyes are not raised too high.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.080]   I don't occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:48.400]   I've quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child within me.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.760]   Oh, Israel, hope in Yahweh.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   That's the whole Psalm right there.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.280]   That's David as king writing, God, I don't want to think about things above my pay grade.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.360]   If David can look at the political landscape of the world and go, that's above my pay grade,
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.600]   you can quiet your soul.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.800]   What's a bigger risk?
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.640]   The outcome of the election or you just losing your first love?
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   I mean, it's true.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.620]   And the more you love the election and all that, and the more you love the whatever, politics,
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.400]   it just sucks your heart in.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:27.000]   I had somebody come to me and say, you know, the liberal churches in town, all the African-American
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.840]   churches and the denominational churches, they're bringing buses in.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.520]   You know, show me clips in their phone of like the preacher who's like, you know, all
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.560]   fired up for Biden and they got buses lined up to help everybody go vote early.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:44.000]   And it's like, if only our church would do that, we could offset them.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.240]   Like those are, that pastor's preaching on election.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.760]   I'm like, I'm happy to preach on election.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   No, not that one.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.560]   Like why don't we get the buses?
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.080]   Why don't we do the voter guides?
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.620]   Why don't we do all that stuff?
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.400]   If the other, if the liberal churches are doing it, why don't we do it?
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.200]   And it's not a numbers game in that regard.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.940]   For us, it's this totally philosophy of ministry, because I'm so concerned you get distracted
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.360]   about this world, the kingdom of man, man, the kingdom, you want to know what's going
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   to happen to the kingdom of man.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   What does God say about it?
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   It's going to go down.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.040]   So don't love it.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Run from it.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:26.800]   You want other churches to take you, bus you to go get your, you know, vote 27 times for
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   election day.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.180]   It's not going to be our church.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.340]   And they say, it's time for the church to stand up.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.240]   Let me tell you, the true church is always standing up.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.920]   That's all we do.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.920]   That's all we do.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.600]   And this is why I'm so weary even of saying, yeah, okay, so you want to impact elections
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   and politics.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   You evangelize people.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.320]   And once they get saved, they'll vote the so-called right way.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.860]   It's like, no, because I have Piper sermon from a few nights ago in my head that you
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.140]   can tell the glory of something by the end of it.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.340]   If you're like, yeah, evangelism is good and conversions are good, because then we'll finally
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.500]   get an election outcome.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.960]   That's still missing the point.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.320]   Evangelism is not the means to the end of better elections.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.920]   Oh no.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:12.160]   Evangelism is the means to the church expanding and magnifying the glory of God on earth.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.140]   Don't confuse those two.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.480]   So what's the alternative to Christian nationalism then?
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.440]   What's the alternative?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.700]   It's the embassy identity.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.080]   The church is an embassy.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.480]   The church is an embassy.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.620]   We're a foreign outpost in a foreign land.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.860]   And in our embassy, we have people from all kinds of nations.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.860]   That's fine.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.860]   That's great.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.860]   Come on in.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:41.120]   And in our own embassy outpost, we develop our own culture, our own language, our own
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.200]   rituals, our own customs.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.280]   We develop all those.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.800]   And we send our people back out into the foreign and hostile worlds.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.160]   1215, Sunday morning, they go back out in the world.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.460]   Tell me you, 1230, 1245.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.960]   They go back out in the world and they're going to come back again next Sunday for strengthening
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   and equipping.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.480]   And they're going to go back out in the world.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.320]   That's their embassy identity.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.180]   And you tear that down when you conflate the two kingdoms.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.560]   Christian nationalism tears that down.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.480]   It says the church isn't an embassy.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   It's the kingdom.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   It's headquarters.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   It's HQ.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.860]   It's not HQ of this world, my friends.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.300]   We do not have a lasting city.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.700]   You want to build a lasting city?
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.560]   You better not be building in this world because nothing will last.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.760]   We do not have a lasting city.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   We fight.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.760]   We labor.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   And we strive.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.080]   And we try to wrestle our eyes off of this world and onto the next.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.720]   You know, I think talking about voting is fine and helpful, especially in discipleship
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.120]   conversations because it reveals so much of a person's heart.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:50.580]   You know, a person's heart is like, you know, I'm just torn, like, you know, this person
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:57.140]   is pro-abortion, but this person, you know, wants to fight global warming, you know, so
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.140]   I can't tell.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.540]   I can't tell which is worse, help.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.340]   And so those are good conversations in just normal discipleship.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.340]   That's fine.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.900]   That brings that stuff out.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.880]   But your goal in that conversation is not to get the person to vote the right way.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.700]   Your goal, honestly, is to get the person to get his eyes off of this world onto Christ
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.060]   who will, of course, transform everything else.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.180]   Listen, I don't want open borders.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.780]   I don't want gay flags in schools.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.140]   I don't want that kind of stuff.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.060]   But I don't want to lose the preciousness of the church.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.260]   I don't want to sacrifice our embassy outpost for an election that's going to happen next
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.460]   year because even if you get away with it and even if the person you want to win wins
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.780]   and whatever, it's going to happen again in four years.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.640]   Which is sucked into a cycle of craziness.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.820]   We don't have a lasting city.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   You want an embassy?
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.040]   Get the flag out of your church.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.040]   You want an embassy?
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   Get the voter guides out of your church.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   You want an embassy?
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:56:00.840]   Get courage and convictions to compel the gospel forward.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.320]   You know, people get so wrapped up about an election and it's so helpful to know the theme
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.720]   of this conference, truth triumphs.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:14.320]   Jesus is coming back and He's not going to be voted into office.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.920]   He's got the throne pre-made.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.240]   The oath appointing Him the mediator and the King of the world that is uttered in Psalm
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.160]   2, repeated in Hebrews 1 and 5, that oath already happened.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.560]   That oath was already recorded back in David's day.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.120]   Of course, spoken at an event when He ascends into heaven.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.040]   It's a timeless oath.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:37.520]   And He's going to come back and take over His throne and rule over the nations.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.200]   We long for that day, and that's the day we set our eyes on.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.400]   God, we're grateful for the promise of a kingdom that won't fail, for the promise of a new
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:51.000]   Jerusalem that will come from heaven, established on the earth.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.400]   Lord, we do pray for our own country and the leaders in our own country, we pray that You
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.360]   would give them wisdom to rule justly, and we pray that they would leave us alone so
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:05.200]   that we can work quietly with our hands, leading a quiet and dignified life, spreading the
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.920]   gospel wherever You give us opportunity.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:13.400]   We want to be wise as serpents, innocent as doves, knowing that ultimately, we are lambs
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.800]   among lions.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:20.320]   God, give us grace until the day of slaughter causes us to stand for You.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.200]   We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
