[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Unfortunately, the following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is incomplete,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.920]   as the closing remarks by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones are missing.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.800]   This was due to the master tape running out before the end of the sermon,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   but we hope it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this sermon.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.840]   "The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in Psalm
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   number 107, the 107th Psalm, reading particularly this evening verses 35 to 38, and also the last
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:47.120]   verse 43. Verses 35 to 38, and verse 43, or perhaps verse 42 as well as 43, of the 107th Psalm.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.800]   "He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water springs;
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.080]   and there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.640]   and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. He blesseth them also,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.840]   so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.880]   The righteous shall see it, and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:39.440]   Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   the loving kindness of the Lord." I call attention, in other words, for the eighth,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   and at any rate for the time being, for the last time, to this magnificent and mighty psalm,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.040]   which is so full of instruction, regarded from the mere standpoint of literature,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.880]   poetry, and construction, as well as in terms of its profound spiritual message to us.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   The theme of the psalm, as we have seen all along, is the desire of this man who wrote it,
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.960]   that all should give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.880]   That was his desire, that everybody should be praising God.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.720]   And he especially calls upon the redeemed of the Lord to say so. They, at any rate,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   have very good reason for praising God and giving thanks to him, because they have experienced
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.480]   such amazing blessings at his hands. The psalmist can't understand why everybody doesn't praise God
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.840]   when he thinks of God in his greatness and his glory, and especially when he thinks of him
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   in his wonderful salvation. But after all, the psalmist was a man who knew the whole situation
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.720]   he knew what men and women were like, and he knew that, alas, it was the truth in his day as it is
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.440]   in our day, that there are so many who have never thanked God at all, and who certainly don't live
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   their lives to the praise of God. Now, he knew that everybody should do that, as I say, but that
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   they didn't do it. And he's worried about them, he's troubled about them, and he writes his psalm
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.440]   in order to try to help. And you remember the method he adopted. He gave us four typical
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   instances or cases of the kind of thing that God does in his mercy and in his goodness.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   He pictures us four people in different forms of extremities, and shows how when everything had
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.640]   failed and they'd lost all hope, they cried out unto the Lord in their distress, and he heard
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.480]   them, and he delivered them. Then, having stated his cases like that, he then comes to the application,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.120]   because it isn't enough just to present the truth, it's got to be applied.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.320]   So from verse 33 to the end, he makes his application.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.480]   And what he really brings it all to is what he says in this last verse.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:49.760]   "Whoso is wise," he says, "and will observe these things, even they shall understand
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.400]   the loving kindness of the Lord." In other words, if we've never praised God,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.280]   if we don't know what it is this evening to have in our hearts a hymn of praise unto God,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.920]   well, there's only one explanation, says this man, it's ignorance.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.280]   It's a lack of wisdom, which means a lack of knowledge, a lack of understanding,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.400]   a lack of discrimination. It's a lack of wisdom. It's a lack of observation.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   In other words, the whole case of the Bible, really, about any person who is not in the
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.480]   right relationship to God and who isn't worshipping God and praising God, the whole attitude of the
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.680]   Bible to such a person is this, that such a person is ignorant. The word it actually uses
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.240]   is the word "fool." "The fool hath said in his heart there is no God." Fool means they're foolish,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.920]   lacking in knowledge, lacking in understanding. Such a person doesn't think, such a person
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   doesn't observe, he doesn't use his eyes, he doesn't really make a note of what he sees in
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.880]   life and in this world and draw the inevitable deductions and conclusions. Now that's the whole
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.160]   case of the Bible against such persons. I put it like that, what I mean is this,
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.480]   that the Bible comes as a great message to such persons, asking them to awaken,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.560]   to begin to look and to see and to observe. Now it's the last thing we want to do, isn't it,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:40.240]   with regard to these matters. We all start off with our prejudices and we cling tenaciously
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.680]   to them, or rather, perhaps I should say, they hold us firmly in their grip in a sort of vice
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.920]   and we can't escape. And they won't allow us to think, they won't allow us to face the facts.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.000]   We just go on thoughtlessly. I think we'll all agree with that proposition.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.680]   We must agree with this, that if all men and women simply sat down and
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.360]   thought first before they acted, life would be very different. I can't believe that anybody
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.800]   would be deliberately cruel or unkind or anybody would act as a beast, but many are doing that.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   If only people thought of the suffering they cause. I don't think they do it,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.520]   but they don't think, you see. At the minute their thinking is partial and incomplete.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   They don't observe, they're not wise in this sense, and they don't understand.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   But especially, the psalmist's case is, his point is,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.080]   that it is our failure to understand the truth about God
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.280]   that is the only ultimate explanation of why it is that everybody isn't worshipping God
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.400]   and everybody isn't praising God. Now, the Bible is a book that seems to be contradicting itself.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.880]   It tells us on the one hand that all our thinking and all our efforts will never
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   make us Christians and provide salvation for us, but on the other hand it tells us that if we are
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   lost it is because we haven't thought and because we haven't worked and reasoned things out.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   The Bible, in other words, makes this argument. It says if we really only observed life as it is,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   if we only worked out the argument, well, we'd be bound to believe in God.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.600]   Now, he tells us that in many ways. Take, for instance, the whole argument from creation.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:54.240]   Are you really prepared to believe that these flowers, in their variety and in their color and
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:02.640]   in their perfection, are but the result of accident and chance? Think of all the constellations and
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   the stars and all the wonder of the firmament. Think of nature in all its rich variety,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:19.440]   the rivers and the mountains and all the plains and all the wealth and the variety that you find
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.600]   there. Is all this accidental? Well, the Bible puts it like this, that God has left his fingerprints
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   in nature so that as you observe the fingerprints, if you really reason and understand and think,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:43.520]   you'll reason back to the mind that used the fingers. The apostle Paul puts that, you remember,
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.760]   in the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans. He says, "We're all without excuse,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:56.320]   for the invisible things of him have been revealed, even his power and his creatorship."
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.760]   Creation is an indication of a creator, the God who's at the back of it all. But, you see,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.280]   we don't observe. We don't look. We don't think. "Oh, we say very nice flowers. They can be bought
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   for such and such a price." Or you pick them in the garden, marvelous, and we stop. But where have
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.040]   they come from? What's the explanation of it all? Well, that's the kind of argument that you find
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.920]   everywhere in the Bible. It's the argument of this man at this point. He says, "If you're not
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.840]   praising God, there's only one reason for it. You're not using your eyes. You're not observing.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.880]   You don't see what's happening round and about you. Look at life. Read the pages of history,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.440]   as well as that of creation." And he says that you'll come to certain conclusions. He then gives
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.800]   us, you remember, these astounding results of his own observation. We've already looked at some of
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.480]   them. Here they are. He says, "If we only kept our eyes open and observed, we should very soon
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.120]   be convinced of the greatness and the power of God. Things are not," he says, "what they seem."
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:14.000]   You look at life superficially and you think, "Oh, well, yes, things go on in their own momentum,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and great men determine life." How often do you read in the newspapers, for instance? Remember
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   during the war and before the war we read it. We read in the newspapers that the whole of history
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.000]   and the fate of the whole of mankind is in the hands of five men. So it appeared. But you know,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.880]   that's really rubbish and nonsense. Where are those five men by now? They've gone. They've
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.000]   vanished. They're off the sea. We're almost beginning to forget their very names. Well,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.840]   why? Well, God has taken them away. He can blow them away with the breath of his mouth. He poureth
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:01.040]   contempt upon princes. Do you remember it? We looked at it a fortnight ago. The might and the
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:08.000]   majesty and the greatness of God. Any man who's read his history truly is a man who ought to walk
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.360]   softly. Oh, yes, you read history superficially and you talk about Alexander the Great and Julius
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.320]   Caesar and your Napoleons and people like that. They seem to be doing everything,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   but they don't, and their dynasties and their empires have gone crashing to nothingness.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.920]   And as I've often reminded you, someone pointed out
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.520]   very rightly that the men that you and I in the history books call Alexander the Great,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:45.440]   the book of Daniel calls a he-goat, just showing you exactly where they are and what their true
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.240]   size is. You see, the greatness of God and the majesty of God. God, the judge eternal.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:59.280]   Look, use your eyes as this, men. Can't you see if you begin to think that you can't afford to
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.680]   adopt a kind of independent attitude with God because your life is in the hands of God?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.560]   You are here in Westminster Chapel now. Where will you be tomorrow night? You don't know.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.600]   You see, our times are in his hands. It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   living God. Reason, says these men. Be wise, observe, see what's happening round and about
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.640]   you. These men who've pitted themselves against God, where are they? They've gone. They've vanished.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   But not only that, he tells us, the greatest tragedy of all, in a sense, is that people
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.320]   don't observe God's salvation. Not only are they ignorant of his power and his greatness,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.640]   they're blind and they're ignorant with respect to what he's done about our deliverance and about
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.440]   our salvation. Now then, we've seen already this about that, that this salvation of God is
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:04.240]   altogether different from everything we've ever thought. It's a complete reversal of everything
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   we've ever imagined. We saw that last Sunday night. We saw one other thing, that our salvation
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:20.400]   doesn't depend upon us at all, not to the slightest extent. It is entirely the result of what God
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:30.000]   himself has done in his only begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Now, I say that
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.200]   men haven't observed that. They're absolutely blind about that. They're ignorant about it.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   Isn't it an astounding thing that with this book open before us for nearly two thousand years,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.920]   people still think that to become Christian is something that you do,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.640]   something you've got to earn, something you've got to achieve. Whereas here is this open book
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.520]   telling us that it's all the free gift of God in Jesus Christ, and that it's a free gift because
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.600]   of what God has done in Christ by sending him into the world, sending him to the cross, punishing
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.800]   our sin in him, and thereby blotting out our transgressions and giving us this salvation
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:19.200]   as a free gift. But people don't seem to observe that. They seem to be absolutely blind about it.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:26.880]   They think, you see, that salvation is for good people and religious people. Whereas if they
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.760]   only really read a little church history, they would find that it's almost invariably been the
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.800]   case that the first people to become Christians are the very last you'd ever expect to see as
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.360]   Christians, and the people who've been most opposed to the Christian truth are those who
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:48.960]   are good and religious and moral. Now that's a fact of history. Read it in the New Testament.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.800]   Wouldn't you have imagined that the Pharisees and scribes and the doctors of the law would
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   have been the very first to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that the publicans and sinners,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.200]   the harlots and all the rest of them, would be right outside someone?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.680]   But you know, the facts were the exact opposite of that.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:16.240]   It was the Pharisees and scribes who persecuted him and who eventually produced his death.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.600]   And he was known as a friend of publicans and sinners.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:30.960]   And a fallen woman could go and wash his feet with her tears and wipe them with the hair of her head.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:39.760]   That's the fact. You see, it's a complete reversal, because it doesn't depend upon what we do,
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:48.720]   but upon what he's done. The free gift of God in Jesus Christ our Lord. But come,
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.320]   let's go on with it, because the psalmist goes on with it. The next thing he tells us that we are
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:04.720]   so blind about by nature and so fail to observe, is the wonderful nature of this salvation.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:13.440]   The character of this salvation. And that's the thing that he deals with in these verses 35 to 38
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.040]   that we're looking at in a special way tonight. Now he puts it, of course, in his typical poetic
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   imagery. This is how he puts it. "He turneth the wilderness into standing water, and dry ground
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.520]   into water springs. And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:40.160]   habitation, and sow the fields and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. He blesseth
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.520]   them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to decrease."
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   Now the blessings of salvation in the Old Testament are nearly always represented in
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.080]   that kind of material manner. There's nothing that so gives us a perfect picture of God's
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.520]   amazing condescension, than the way in which he stoops always to the level of the people to whom
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.920]   he's speaking. And here in the Old Testament, he revealed his desire to bless and his way of
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:19.040]   blessing in a material manner, material prosperity, as depicted here in this picture. But that's only
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   a picture of the same truth, the same message, which we have, of course, in a more spiritual
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.120]   form in the New Testament scriptures. Here we have it like this, you see, "He blesseth them also,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.920]   so that they are multiplied greatly." The Apostle Paul puts that in writing to the Ephesians by
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.120]   talking about the exceeding riches of his grace, or the unsearchable riches of Christ. Exactly the
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:52.240]   same thing, the same God, giving a picture in the Old, doing it in its fullness in the New.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:19:00.480]   So that I want to call your attention this evening to the marvelous and the wonderful character
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:10.400]   of the blessings of this Christian salvation. What's it mean? Well, we saw last Sunday night
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.120]   that it means forgiveness of sins, but it means much more than that. It doesn't stop at that.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:23.520]   The first thing we all need is to be forgiven. And thank God, because the blood of Jesus Christ
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:30.800]   was shed for my sins, I am forgiven. There's no need to argue about that anymore. There it is,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.160]   it's finished with once and forever. It's the initial step. When I acknowledge my sin,
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.480]   when I confess it, when I admit that I deserve nothing but punishment, I am told that Christ
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   has borne it for me. My sins are forgiven, I have forgiveness and reconciliation as a free gift.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:57.840]   But that's only the beginning. Something marvelous and amazing and astounding follows.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.760]   What is it? Well, let me try to tell you about it, interpreting this man's pictures.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:14.320]   The first thing about this great Christian salvation is that it is the work of God in the soul.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:25.280]   Now, he puts it here, you see, "He, God, turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:35.680]   and dry ground into water springs." Now, the first thing we have to say about this work, therefore,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:47.760]   is that it is a miracle. It is nothing less than a miracle. You see, there was a wilderness.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:55.280]   Well, you can do nothing with a wilderness. And the very last thing you can do with a wilderness
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:03.200]   is suddenly to make it abound with a great water supply. A wilderness was just a barren rocky land
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   where there was no water whatsoever. There was just nothing there at all in that way.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:16.000]   But suddenly, a wilderness becomes standing water and dry ground,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.320]   which had always presented a problem from this standpoint of water.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.720]   Suddenly, you find a mass of water springs springing up all around. And you've done nothing
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.680]   about it yourself, but there it is, it has happened. The wilderness has been turned into standing water
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.280]   and the dry ground into water springs. What is it? My friends, it's nothing short of and nothing
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:49.920]   less than a miracle. What is a miracle? Well, a miracle is an action that God alone can perform.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.440]   It is a manifestation of God's eternal creative power. It is the God who normally chooses to act
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.480]   through secondary causes and by various ways and means, acting directly. Not that he breaks his
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.240]   laws, he supersedes them for the time being. And of course, God is eternally free, can always do
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.080]   that. He chooses one way, he can choose another way. He chooses indirect methods, he can choose
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.640]   the direct method. And a miracle is God acting directly, God acting immediately, God producing
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.880]   something out of nothing, as it were, God exerting again his great creative power. It's a miracle.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:41.520]   And what I'm privileged to say this evening is this, what I'm privileged to remind you of is
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:50.960]   that when you become a Christian, you are nothing less and nothing short again of a miracle.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.560]   For anybody to become a Christian is a miraculous action,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:04.000]   nothing less. You see, that is why it's so difficult for one not to be vehement as one
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.560]   denounces that conception of the Christian as just a good man, a man who's pulling himself
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.640]   up by his own bootstrings, a man who's trying to live a good life. My dear friend,
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   you're robbing God of his glory, and you don't understand the glorious position of the Christian.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:27.120]   A Christian is a miracle, and nothing short of a miracle. It's God who's acted upon him,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.520]   and he's acted upon his soul. The Creator has taken hold of him and slashed the old
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:40.640]   and reformed the new. To use the pictures of the Old Testament prophets,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:51.680]   it's nothing short of a potter taking hold of a lump of clay and forming and fashioning. Yes,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.760]   to use the further picture, it's the potter taking hold of a vessel that was a little bit marred,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.720]   and first of all smashing it, then taking hold of it and molding it again and forming it into
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.920]   a new vase, into a new mold, after a new pattern. That's what happens when one becomes a Christian.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:21.680]   It's a miraculous action. It's the action of the almighty God himself. It isn't the man himself
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.960]   doing it. It isn't the preacher persuading him to do something. It isn't the preacher doing anything.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.360]   It's God. It isn't even a teaching. It isn't a philosophy. It isn't a theory. It's nothing
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:42.480]   but the direct action of the almighty God himself. A wilderness becoming standing water,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:49.840]   dry ground, water springs, and of course, because it's miraculous, it can't be understood.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.680]   At least, it seems to me that there is something tragically wrong with the
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.640]   mental processes of any man who tries to understand a miracle.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:07.520]   By definition, a miracle should not even be tried to be understood.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.800]   When I postulate that a miracle is of the direct action of God,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.760]   well, how can I understand it? How can anybody understand it?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.200]   It's no use, you know, trying to understand the mechanics of how a wilderness becomes standing
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.280]   water. Oh, you can try if you like. You can go and consult the geologists, but they'll tell you,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.600]   if they're honest, that they just don't know. They say, "This sort of thing doesn't happen. I've
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.800]   never seen it before, but I've got to admit it. My eyes, I've got ocular evidence and demonstration
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.080]   that there is that standing water where I knew formerly there was a wilderness. I just don't
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:54.320]   know, and he can't know, because it doesn't conform to the rules. It's above them. It's supernatural.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.680]   So is the Christian. Well, I needn't keep you with this. Our blessed Lord himself has given us
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.280]   that perfect exposition, which I read to you at the beginning in the third chapter of the Gospel
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:20.960]   according to St. John. Nicodemus, how well we understand him. There he is confronted by this
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.160]   man who's been watching him, he's been listening to him, and of course he's been observing,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.480]   and he's drawn certain conclusions, and he goes to him at night and he says,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.920]   "Master, I see and I understand clearly that thou art a teacher sent from God,
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   for no man could do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him."
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:52.640]   And then he was on the point of asking, "Tell me, how'd you do it? What is it you've got? How did
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.000]   you get it? What is this?" Our Lord interrupts him at once. He isn't allowed to put his supplementary
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.400]   questions. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:13.200]   God." "No, no, I don't understand this," says Nicodemus. "It's no use telling me that I, an old
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.720]   man, must be born again. How can a man, when he's old, can he enter the second time into his mother's
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.800]   womb and be born? It doesn't sound rational, does it? It doesn't conform to the usual things that
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.920]   we see in life. It doesn't conform to the book, as it were. My textbook tells me this leads to that
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   cause and effect. But you're talking about being born again and I'm an old man. How can these
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:46.560]   things be?" Poor Nicodemus. Fancy trying to understand a miracle. You can't understand a
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.080]   miracle. But you see, he goes on and our Lord at last turns to him and says, "Look here, Nicodemus,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:01.280]   the wind bloweth where it listeth. Thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:10.560]   where's it come from, where's it going, you can't see it." So, like that, is every one that is born
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:18.080]   of the Spirit. The thing itself eludes our understanding. It's beyond our power of analysis.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.960]   You don't understand the thing, you simply see its effects and results. You see the clothes on the
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.160]   line waving in the breeze, you see the effects of it perhaps. Perhaps when a hurricane comes aroot,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.120]   blow 'em off. You still don't understand anything about it. It's a mystery, it's a marvel,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:39.040]   it's something beyond us that eludes our grasp. You see the results, you don't understand the thing.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:48.640]   So, is every one that is born of the Spirit. Is that your conception of being a Christian,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:54.800]   my friend? Have you realized that that is the very truth about the Christian? That there is
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.360]   that about the Christian which not only anybody else can't understand, he can't understand it
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.200]   himself. He doesn't know how it's happened, but he knows it has happened, that's all,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:14.560]   and nothing more. It's like this wound. God's action upon the soul, a miraculous action of the
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.360]   almighty God. You see when you become a Christian, what will have happened is this, that God will
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.480]   have taken hold of you, and he'll have done something within you. That's Christianity and
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:40.000]   nothing less. I don't preach decisions, I preach regeneration. I preach God acting in the souls
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.200]   of men by his Holy Spirit, and nothing less. That's Christianity. The wilderness, standing
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:58.560]   water, dry ground, water springs. But let me hurry to the second thing which follows inevitably from
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:06.720]   what I've just been saying. The change that God works in the soul is a complete change.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.680]   I needn't keep you with this neither. You can't imagine a more complete change than a wilderness
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:21.440]   and standing water. Dry ground, water springs, it's the complete antithesis.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:32.720]   It is an entire and a complete change. Now that's Christianity. That is what happens to a person
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.120]   when he or she becomes a Christian. The change is not just some superficial change.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.880]   It isn't merely something that happens on the surface of life.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:53.520]   It isn't a mere superficial improvement. It isn't a mere addition to what we already were.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.960]   My dear friend, am I making it plenty? It's an entire change of constitution.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.840]   Now you see, so many think of Christianity in that superficial way, don't they?
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.240]   They think that when a man becomes a Christian, well, something happens on the surface. He drops
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.040]   drink and a few things like that, and there's a superficial change in his conduct and in his
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.080]   behavior. He's a better man. He quits certain things, and perhaps he adds certain things to
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:28.320]   his life also. A superficial work, a superficial improvement, a kind of addition to his life.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.800]   He was a good man before, but now he becomes a religious man in addition, that sort of thing.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:42.320]   But that isn't it. When God does this work, this miraculous work, he does it
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:51.200]   in such a way as to change the very constitution. Make your geological analysis of a wilderness,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.880]   then make an analysis after it's become standing water, and you'll find it's absolutely different.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.960]   Go to that dry ground, you've done your borings, you've made your testings, you say there's no
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   water there at all, you've called in your water diviner, there's not a trace, he says,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:14.000]   there's not a pool, there's nothing anywhere. Go again, and you'll find the twig in the hand
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.200]   of the water diviner will not rise up, it's being pulled down. The nature, the constitution
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.920]   of the ground and the soil is absolutely different. That's becoming a Christian.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   So that when a man becomes a Christian, it isn't that he's a little bit better,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:39.280]   he's got a new nature. It's a complete change of nature. The Apostle Paul tells us that this
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.760]   work of Christ through the Spirit is done not on tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.920]   heart. When a man becomes a Christian, it isn't the surface of his life that's changed, it's his
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:33:01.360]   heart that's changed. He's given a new heart. He is born again. He's given a new nature. He becomes
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:07.680]   a new creature. He is a new man. Those are the terms. It's exactly the difference between a
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.040]   wilderness and standing water, dry ground and water springs. There is something brought into
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.760]   being that wasn't there before. That's Christianity. I say it isn't a mere addition, it's a radical
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.840]   constitutional change. There was no water there before, it's now full of water. It's as big as
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:32.640]   that. Something is brought into being in the Christian that was non-existent prior to that.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:40.240]   That's Christianity. That the Almighty God gives you the gift of life.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   He puts a new principle of life into you, and therefore you're an entirely new person.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:57.680]   When one becomes a Christian, I say God has, as it were, almost injected this new principle into us,
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:04.480]   so that we really are entirely different people from what we were before.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.400]   We've got a new understanding.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:14.960]   Before, we didn't understand the Bible at all. We didn't understand any of its message. It was a
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.120]   completely boring book. We now begin to understand it. It begins to speak to us. A new man, you see,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.200]   has got a new understanding, a new outlook. We've got new desires and new tastes.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:36.160]   We like the book. We like prayer. We like mixing with God's people. Saints used to be utter bores
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.000]   to us. We now prefer their company to anybody in the world, and we'd sooner spend a night with the
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:50.160]   humblest saint in a cottage than to dwell in the palaces of kings and queens if they're not
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:59.040]   Christians. That's a test of your being a Christian. A new nature, demanding new things, having new
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.960]   desires, new interests, new hope, and new power in exactly the same way. Now, let me read you something
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.560]   which puts all this very much more perfectly than I can.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:19.120]   And I give you this at random. I could give you thousands of stories to prove the same thing.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.480]   But I read you this particular one because this book only came into my hand today.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:31.680]   I'd asked for it a few days ago. I received it today. This is an account of a man who was a
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.880]   Methodist preacher, born at the end of the 18th century and who lived into the 19th century.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.480]   And listen to what he says about himself, how he became a Christian.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.600]   He says that as the result of what happened to him,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:54.000]   "I could no more doubt of my acceptance with God than of my own existence,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:04.080]   and love to God in return for so great and undeserved a benefit sprang up within me."
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.920]   There was no praise to God before. He was a wilderness. But now you see there's praise to
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:17.760]   God springing up within him. The water has suddenly appeared. "With a train of spiritual and heavenly
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:30.560]   affections, mine was a change not only from misery to happiness, from sorrow to joy, but from the
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:41.360]   love and practice of sin to the love and practice of holiness." Listen to this. "The entire bent and
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:48.000]   habit of my nature was changed." That's what I'm trying to tell you. It's the difference between a
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.040]   wilderness and a standing water, a dry ground and springs of water. The entire bent and habit of
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:01.600]   my nature was changed. That is Christianity. When God acts, that's what he does. A new nature.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:13.200]   Listen. "My views and feelings, my apprehensions and inclinations, my desires, hopes and prospects
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:21.520]   were all new. The experience of nearly seventy years," he wrote this when he was an old man,
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   "the experience of nearly seventy years has served only to strengthen my conviction
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:37.760]   that the change I then underwent was no delusion, but a blessed reality, the effect of a divine
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.320]   operation." You see, I had prepared my sermon before I met this, but what a perfect statement
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:53.840]   of it. At this moment in 1870, the love of Christ is as sweet as it was on the 16th day of July,
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:01.600]   1801, when for the first time in its richness and power, it was shed abroad in my heart by
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   the Holy Ghost given unto me. That's it. Then listen. "I returned home from this prayer meeting,"
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:17.840]   because it happened to him in a prayer meeting, "a distance of about two miles, scarcely knowing
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.640]   whether I was in the body or out of the body. Every object in nature above, around, beneath
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.800]   appeared in an aspect entirely new, and gazing upon the heavens and the earth, I felt as I had
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:42.480]   never felt before the touching sentiment, 'My Father made them all.'" Need I say any more?
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.640]   That's what it means to become a Christian.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.960]   Not you are deciding to follow Christ, not you are deciding to be better,
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.680]   not you are going in for Christianity. No, no. But God putting into you that
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:08.720]   that so changes you that you really don't know yourself. You're a new man, you're a new person,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.600]   you're a new creation. Everything is different. All things are passed away. Behold,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.400]   all things have become new. My friends, you mustn't be satisfied with anything less than this.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.600]   If you've been satisfied with something less, is it true Christianity, do you think?
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.920]   Are you looking back to your decision, or are you looking back like Thomas Jackson did,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.480]   to what God did in his soul, and put this new life into him? That's Christianity.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:43.360]   And when that happens, you know it shows itself. And you do begin to sing and to praise God,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:49.600]   and you are lost in a sense of wonder, love, and of praise. It's a miraculous work,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:57.360]   it is a complete work, a complete change. And that leads me to the final word.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:05.760]   It is a change that is completely satisfying in its results and effects.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.680]   Look at the way in which this man puts it. What is it that one becomes conscious of?
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.080]   What is it that one experiences when God does this great work in the soul?
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.120]   Well, the first thing is a sense of rest.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:31.760]   And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.520]   You see, before that they'd been traveling, they'd been journeying.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.880]   They were looking for water, looking for suppliers. They said, "We'd like to settle
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.080]   down somewhere and live a full life, but how can we? We can't settle down in this wilderness.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.600]   There's no water there. We'll die of thirst and of starvation. There's nothing growing here,
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   because there isn't any water." But now you see everything's changed,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:03.760]   and they can settle down in a city of habitation. They found rest for their souls.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.760]   There's nothing more blessed about the Christian life than that.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.040]   It's the end of all the journeyings and the wanderings.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.640]   You remember how Charles Wesley puts it in the hymn expressing his conversion.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.240]   He asks the Christian, "Oh, when shall all my wanderings cease?"
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.720]   You've been at it for years, looking for something that you can't find.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:38.000]   Looking for rest for your soul, looking for peace, looking for happiness.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.480]   You've read books, you've attended lectures, you've listened to sermons.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.920]   There's nothing you haven't done. You're looking for it, there's a longing,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.160]   and you travel backwards and forwards, and you're seeking and searching and looking,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.040]   but you can't find. "Oh, when will all my wandering cease?"
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:04.720]   And suddenly, you find that you've arrived. Just when you were most hopeless,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.840]   you met someone who looked at you with an eye of pity and said, "Come unto me,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:19.280]   ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:29.840]   And you went to him, and you found it. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and rest.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:38.960]   Lay down, thou weary one, lay down thy head upon my breast."
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:49.200]   That's it. And you heard him, you listened to him, and you did it, and you found rest for your soul.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.680]   Oh, let me utter the great and the memorable phrase of Augustine,
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:04.400]   the brilliant philosopher who nevertheless kept his mistress. He had been wandering and seeking.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:10.160]   At last, he hears the voice, he's found it, Christ calling him to rest.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:19.280]   And as it were, he sat down and wrote, "Thou hast made us for thyself."
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:29.520]   And our souls are restless until they rest in thee, but in Christ they do.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:36.720]   A city of habitation, the end of the journeyings. You needn't look and prospect for water any
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:44.480]   longer. It's gushing up before your eyes. Settle down, build your city, rest for your souls.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.200]   End of wandering and striving and vain seeking and searching.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.640]   Yes, but not only that, you see, satisfaction also. Listen.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:02.480]   He maketh the wilderness into ascending water, and dry ground into water springs,
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:10.240]   and there he maketh the hungry to dwell. The hunger and thirst of life are satisfied
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:19.440]   for the first time. You'll forgive me, I know. You know I find it very difficult to finish with
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.400]   this psalm, but I'm determined to do so tonight. I could go on for hours on this.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   The satisfaction of becoming a Christian.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.680]   What am I talking about? Well, I'm talking about intellectual satisfaction.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.480]   I assure you that there is no intellectual satisfaction in the whole wide world
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.200]   but this. But here there is complete intellectual rest and satisfaction.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:57.840]   I don't speak about myself in this pulpit, but I'm a man who by nature is restless,
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.040]   intellectually restless, intellectually inquisitive. I'm a born skeptic.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.440]   I use reason. I believe in reason, and I want to know reasons like Nicodemus did.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:17.200]   I didn't find them in the way I expected, but I have found them. They're all here.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:23.680]   Intellectual rest. I'm interested in the philosophy of history.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.520]   I'm interested in the nature of man. I'm interested to know why the world as it is tonight,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.120]   and I find no explanation except this. Here I find a complete answer.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:41.440]   I know of no problem but that I find the answer here. I'm making the statement deliberately.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:49.840]   Complete intellectual satisfaction. Oh yes, but not only intellectual.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:55.600]   I find also complete emotional satisfaction.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:06.400]   I'm emotional. I like to be moved. I know of nothing that can move me like this.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:12.240]   You know, I find it difficult at times to read certain passages in the scripture. They overcome
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.920]   me. There are certain hymns, the words, and the tunes. Haven't you felt them moving you to the
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:24.240]   very foundations of your being? Oh, not the sentiment of your films, but a strong, healthy,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.160]   manly emotion that you're never ashamed of afterwards. Something that puts you on your feet,
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:36.320]   charges you like a battery, makes you feel that you're a superman almost because of the divine
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:45.760]   energy. That's what you get when this change takes place. A complete satisfaction intellectually,
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.040]   emotionally, and in every other respect, and let me hurry on, you'll find that you'll have a purpose
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:58.000]   in life. The tragedy about the man who's not a Christian is that his life is purposeless.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.360]   He doesn't know where he's going. He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.720]   The role of life is uncertain, and that's why he lives as he does, because he hasn't a purpose.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.240]   He's going round and round in circles, and he doesn't know where it's all going to end.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:19.120]   Come to this position, and you'll see your life in this world as but a journey, but a pilgrimage.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:29.440]   Did you notice how that first hymn of ours put it? There was a man who could thank God
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.800]   that even the joys of this world are touched with a little pain,
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:45.200]   that even the most wonderful roses have got thorns and pricks upon them, beauty and pain together.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:57.280]   He thanks God for it, for this reason, that all these blessed, happy, joyous things may be our
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:03.600]   guide and not our chain. They are there, and they're put there by God to remind us that this
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:09.280]   isn't the only life and the only world, but that we're moving on, and that we're only pilgrims and
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:16.080]   strangers and sojourners and travellers. We're going on to a great and endless eternal life,
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.480]   and there's a purpose in it all. I'm here to live for God's glory, to help others,
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.760]   to bring them to the same life, to safeguard their eternal future. What a wonderful purpose!
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:35.200]   Life doesn't become just a riot or a round of pleasure-seeking which ends in pain and remorse
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:42.400]   and regret. No, no, a purpose and an objective, something leading me ever onwards. That's what
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:50.480]   happens. And not only that growth and development, and sow the fields and plant vineyards
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.160]   which may yield fruits of increase, he blesses them also so that they are multiplied greatly.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.480]   That's another wonderful thing about this life. It's a life that grows.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:09.200]   I say this to the glory of God in this pulpit.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:15.440]   I know much more about the grace of God tonight than I did a year ago.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:23.680]   You know there's no end to this. It's like entering into a great sea, and you swim out,
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   and you think, "Well, I must have reached the greatest depth of all." Not a bit. You're only
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:34.240]   at the beginning. It goes on, and the depths are more profound, and the heights are greater. It's
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:42.400]   entering into this eternal scheme and plan of God. Grow in grace, says Peter, and in a knowledge of
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:52.640]   the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. My dear friend, you who are not a Christian, do you think this
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.720]   Christian life is boring? It's exciting. It's tremendously exciting. I'll tell you, quite
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   frankly, my greatest problem in this world is to find time. There are so many things I want to read,
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:10.880]   and so many things I want to do, and I'm discovering fresh aspects. Increasing glories come to meet me
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:17.760]   as I go around fresh corners, and I haven't a tongue. It's so amazing. It expands. The horizon
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.560]   goes ever further and further away, or it's like a man climbing a mountain. He thinks he's reached
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:31.200]   the top. There's yet another. Unfortunately, at this point, the original tape comes to an end,
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.040]   and therefore, the rest of this message by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is now lost.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:41.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
