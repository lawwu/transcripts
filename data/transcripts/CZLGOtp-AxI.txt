[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   for whatever we're struggling with, whatever we're struggling to get started with, there's always a
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.000]   little bit of a push of energy that we need to get started with the thing. Now, the question is,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.400]   how do we get there? Once we've got the clarity on the thing, once we've tried to figure out what
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.720]   our emotions are getting in the way, at some point, some stuff is just kind of boring and you just
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.200]   kind of have to do it. So how do you nudge yourself to just get started? At this point,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   some people would say that motivation is a thing. You've got to motivate yourself to do it. You've
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.240]   got to really want it. You've got to want it so much that you can't breathe or whatever these
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.200]   motivational videos say. And that's fine. But there's a great book by Jeff Hayden called The
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.160]   Motivation Myth, which basically argues that motivation is a bit of a myth. We don't summon
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.040]   up the motivation magically to do a thing. We do the thing. And by seeing a small success,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.520]   that then helps us summon the motivation to continue to do the thing.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.600]   And so really, motivation doesn't lead to action. Action leads to motivation.
