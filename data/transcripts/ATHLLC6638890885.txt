[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.040]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.960]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.000]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer who
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.840]   loves doing all the research to get the best experience in life
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.480]   without an expensive price tag.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.240]   And today I couldn't be more excited because I'm talking to
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.640]   someone who's had a huge impact on my travel life, Rolf Potts.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   If you're not familiar with him, you should be.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.960]   He's an award-winning travel writer who's been published in almost every
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.920]   publication, but I came to know him from the book he wrote almost 20 years ago,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.920]   Vagabonding, An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel, which
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.720]   became a classic of travel writing and has been an international bestseller.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.760]   In fact, I stumbled upon the book in 2009, and it played a huge role in
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.160]   Amy and my taking a trip for eight months to backpack around the world.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.320]   It was also a part of the inspiration for my friend, Tim Ferriss's
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840]   book, The Four-Hour Workweek.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.240]   Needless to say, it's a must read for travelers and maybe even more
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.600]   importantly, people who don't necessarily travel, but want to.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   And just this month, he followed it up with a new book called The Vagabond's
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.640]   Way, 366 Meditations on Wanderlust, Discovery, and the Art of Travel.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.920]   It is filled with stories of travel and journaling, quotes for each day
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.400]   of the leap year, important note, from centuries of philosophers, authors,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.760]   poets, and travelers, all paired with reflections about the wonder
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.840]   and importance of travel.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.000]   I found it to be fabulous, especially for someone like me who struggles
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.200]   to find the time to sit down and read a few hundred pages at once.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.480]   In this conversation, I want to talk about time wealth, why that's
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.680]   such a vital topic in life, how it transforms travels, and what anyone
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.480]   can take from the concept to travel in a richer way, how we can adapt to
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   the changes of travel technology and still have amazing adventures, why
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.760]   he once traveled for six weeks without luggage and what you can learn from
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.200]   that experiment, how leaving your phone behind or getting lost might
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920]   create richer experiences, why he thinks that as you get older, you can
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   still have more richer and fulfilling travels and so much more.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.280]   Let's get started.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   Rolf, welcome to the show.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.000]   Thanks for being here.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.040]   Good to talk to you, Chris.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   Happy to talk about this.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.880]   So I have a lot of questions.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160]   Big fan of yours.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.760]   Someone always asks you, what's your favorite book?
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.120]   I was like, I don't know, but Vagabonding is the book I've
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.800]   purchased more to give to others.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.040]   So I've tried to live a lot of the spirit of what you've written,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.960]   but I will kick us off and ask, what do you think one of the biggest
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.480]   misconceptions the average person has about travel as you believe
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   it is and you embody it?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600]   Well, that it's expensive for one thing.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   I think that for generations, this is something I talk about in
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   the new book, The Vagabond's Ways, for generations, it's sort of
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.920]   been seen as this indulgence.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   It's been seen as this thing that wealthy people do to showcase their
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.240]   lives, when in fact, I think people of all backgrounds have always been
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.760]   able to travel if they've made it a priority, expense is a big one.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.920]   And of course, hacking is something that you focus on and we can
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.080]   talk about different hacks and you talked about time wealth.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.800]   I mean, that was the huge hack for me from the beginning, realizing
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   that time is more important than wealth in a certain sense, that
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.200]   creating time is really what you need to do to create a dream
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400]   experience like travel.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.600]   There are other things too.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   There's this notion that the world is more dangerous than it is,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.560]   partly because it used to be that the old headline, man bites
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   dog, media environment.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.720]   Well, now it's clickbait, bad news clicks better than good news.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.040]   And so fear is another thing.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   And then I guess just difficult, but I think it's easier and easier
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   these days, especially in the world where so much information is
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   available, of course, sometimes there's too much information, but
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.840]   there's enough information doing at least encourage us that there
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.480]   are people who are not that different from us traveling in a very
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   rich and slow and long-term way.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.360]   It sounds like it's something you've been thinking about for a long
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.640]   time, because 2008, 2009, that's pretty early in the life cycle
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.960]   of my first book, Vagabonding.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.240]   So my wife and I, we had two jobs and I got laid off and I was trying
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.400]   to find some freelance work.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.280]   She didn't love her job and she quit her job.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.200]   We're like, let's take a trip before we find new jobs.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.520]   We started putting pins up on a map of where in the world we wanted to go.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.320]   And we didn't really know that traveling for more than
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.920]   like a vacation was a thing.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   We'd never been told that we never heard of the gap year.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.240]   And I read your book and I was like, oh, my gosh, why a month?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   Why a week?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   Why not just go and see what happens?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.760]   And so we ended up buying, or I guess technically in our case, using
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.680]   points to get a one way ticket to South Africa.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.640]   And we had a rough idea of where we were going to go, but we certainly
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   didn't have anything more than a couple nights booked and we just went.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.240]   And it lasted about seven and a half months.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.160]   It ended up costing about seven and a half thousand dollars.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.120]   Adjusted for inflation.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.240]   Who knows what that is today?
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.360]   But it's a whole lot less than most people spend on an eight
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.520]   month trip if they take it.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   And I think the slow travel, which I want to get into is probably the
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.280]   thing that made that possible.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.320]   Not trying to rush from place to place.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.560]   And then obviously staying with locals helped also.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.320]   That's awesome.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.880]   It's funny.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.480]   Seven and a half months is exactly how long my first vagabonding trip was.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.000]   In 1994, it cost me $5,000.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.960]   All of this was back when like gas was as low as 79 cents
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.160]   a gallon in the United States.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.040]   And then of course this is before hashtag van life.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   I was just living in a van.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   I was just dirtbagging it.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.240]   But that's really cool to hear.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.960]   And it's also cool to hear that it was sort of, you lost your job.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.240]   We had a disruption in your life.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.320]   And so you responded by doing something you dream about.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.680]   I think sometimes people, they put off their dream life to some
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.320]   undefined time in the future.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   Often retirement in the United States is a huge one because really
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.600]   nobody is saying that you can travel more than a vacation until you're
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   retired and you have more time for that.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.840]   Well, you can create time.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.000]   You can look for time wealth.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.480]   So that's really cool that you responded to a disruption in your
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.600]   professional life by just sort of creating a little, what Tim Ferriss
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.120]   would call a mini retirement, but just an opportunity to embrace the world
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.040]   and live those travel dreams now, because you can, and even if you
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.480]   can't live them this second, you can start saving money and make them
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.920]   happen much sooner than American society tells you, you can take that dream trip.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.240]   The cost to fly internationally, the cost of expensive lodging that
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.800]   you can confirm right away.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.920]   And you don't have to walk around a town to find is such a huge piece
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.320]   of the expense that if you say, okay, well, we're going to go and stay.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.240]   And you're willing to stay.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760]   And you're willing to find local accommodations.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.960]   Everything gets a lot cheaper.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.040]   And then my hack for your fear thing was that I always told people, they
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.720]   were like, Oh, is this country safe?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.000]   I've heard it's dangerous.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.040]   I don't know if it's still in there.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   But there is a lonely planet for New York city, a long time ago,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   probably at least 15 years ago.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.920]   And if you looked at it under the safety section, it said, well, if
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.160]   you're going to New York city, you should carry a money belt and you
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.560]   should make sure you put all of your money in your passport and your money
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.360]   belt and tuck it in your pants in the front.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.040]   I remember money belts were like a travel thing for safety.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.920]   And I literally ripped the page out and I would show people and they'd be like,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.840]   Oh, I've been to New York.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.760]   You don't need a money belt.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   I don't carry a money belt in New York.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.160]   And I'm like, exactly.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.280]   So if they're telling you New York isn't safe and you know, it is.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.160]   Do you really need to believe that everywhere else in the world isn't safe?
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.600]   So that was my kind of mindset shift that I gave people was everyone's
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   going to say, everything's dangerous because it's clickbait.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.560]   And if you can get over that, the whole world can be a lot more opening to you.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.240]   There is a, to be somewhat facetious about it, a money belt industrial complex.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.680]   There's a lot of things that people would sell you to sort of assuage
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.000]   this fear when in fact, yeah, just put a couple of bucks in your sock or
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.560]   just put it in your pocket and odds are New York is full of New Yorkers who
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.840]   don't typically get pickpocketed and a lot of times the pickpocket economy
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.000]   focuses on the most obvious touristic part of a place that most parts of any
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   city in the world are going to be places where the pickpockets are going to hang
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.480]   out because there's not that many tourists to pick their pockets.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   I'm sure that there's a few picked pockets a day in time square, for example,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.040]   but New Yorkers don't go there.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.080]   And that area is interesting for a while, but then there's more interesting
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.720]   parts of the city after you're done.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   Sometimes just showing up and figuring things out can do you a lot.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.240]   I think sometimes we feel like we're hacking something like hotel expenses.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.800]   You get online, you do some comparison shopping, you find an air quotes
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.880]   bargain, and then you get to the city and you go straight to the hotel, not
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.080]   realizing there might be entire blocks of hotels where people in Thailand stay
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.840]   that cost a fraction of the big international hotels that you're
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.400]   shopping for online, for example.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.640]   So again, one hack might be simply the willingness to not plan too much in
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.120]   advance, because as I say, in the new book, you get smarter every day of your
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.200]   trip, whatever deals you found while you're sitting in your home office.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   And sometimes there's fantastic ones.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.960]   And I'm not going to fault cool deals that the travel industry has, but
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.040]   sometimes you're not going to know that this cool mom and pop beach hut in
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.160]   Indonesia that isn't online, but it's in the lexicon of every traveler who's
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.320]   been through that part of Sumatra, that that is going to cost you 12 bucks
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.880]   instead of the $50 that seemed like a bargain before.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.760]   So I think that confidence and savvy that comes with just each day of being on the
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.320]   road of a long trip really is one of the best hacks out there.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.720]   I got a call this week from a reporter at the Washington post who asked my opinion
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.960]   on this Tik TOK video that she was writing a piece on.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.520]   I was like, ah, this is 2022 at its finest.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.480]   And it was a woman saying, before you book your flight, before you book your
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.400]   hotel, what you should really do is create a Google map and put a pin on every single
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.520]   thing you want to do and see and eat and drink.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.200]   And that way, you know exactly where to book your hotel and you
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.560]   could plan it all out in advance.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.760]   A quote of mine that ended up in the article was that I really worry in today's
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.080]   day and age that we're kind of creating a checklist before we even leave and we've
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.840]   got a map and we plot everything out.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's like, what kind of experience are you going to have?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   And so I'm not opposed to trying to flag some things you want to see, but I would
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.920]   encourage people to leave most of your time unplanned, have the list, maybe you
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.080]   could write a list of what you want to do, but don't commit to I'm doing this this
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.880]   day and kind of set yourself in stone and that that's the plan, because I'm sure as
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.280]   you've seen, most of the most memorable experiences I've had traveling are not the
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.840]   experience that I put on the list before I went.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.640]   It's a random person you met at a bar that I invited you to come have dinner with
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.160]   this family. And then the list goes on a random place.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.280]   You just wandered down a street.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   Yeah, I don't take fault with that list, be it with pins on a Google map or just on
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.240]   a piece of paper you keep in your pocket.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.000]   But I think you really have to inbake a willingness to throw it away if you find
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.200]   something more inspiring, because in a way, there's almost like a speed dating
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.120]   analogy here, you know, that we're going to go on all these set dates that with all
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.800]   of these people or places with certain categories defined in advance, when maybe
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.320]   you'll fall in love with the person you meet in the lobby, what happens if you've
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.880]   overplanned everything and you don't leave yourself open to the spontaneous and
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.480]   literally or metaphorically falling in love, if not with a person in a place and
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.440]   staying longer than you had planned on staying.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.720]   And I think that's a big problem that people have.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.840]   I understand why you have a giant checklist of things you want to do in a
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.280]   place. But sometimes you're racing around so much trying to get to the checklist
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.560]   that you don't give yourself time to slow to relax and look and just savor a
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.840]   place. I think savoring is something we don't yet have an app for, right?
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.040]   That being able to just be happy that you're on the other side of the world,
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.200]   you're sitting on this beach and looking at the Indian Ocean and and just being
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.080]   grateful for this moment and not worrying about where you're going to be doing
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.400]   tomorrow. That's a great gift of travel.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.080]   And I think allowing yourself to set the itinerary aside when you really respond to
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.520]   something on the road. That's a great non-planned plan to have.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.960]   Just the willingness to improvise as you become inspired and more knowledgeable.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.720]   I've heard you tell a story that I'm going to hope you repeat about someone you
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.920]   were speaking with, I think, that was frustrated that they didn't get a chance
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.600]   to go do everything they wanted to see in Paris because they were stuck at a
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.000]   cafe and all they wanted to do was experience Paris.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.120]   And they felt shackled to the cafe.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.280]   Yeah, well, actually, that's more than one person.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.600]   And initially that was me.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.400]   Like the first few times I went to Paris, I was just so frustrated that the
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.800]   restaurants are slow, like America is very efficient.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.560]   They can churn people through restaurants.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.200]   They find your table, they bring your bill.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.400]   In Paris, it was just so comparatively slow.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   And then in time, I realized that that was just part of the pleasure of being there.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.520]   And so I had students and friends who would come and visit me in Paris.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.040]   I teach a writing class there every summer.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   And I realized for all the people who are sitting worrying about their bucket list
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.360]   of things to do in Paris while they're waiting for their creme brulee to come,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.880]   they're looking for an experience of Paris that is abstracted from the actual
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.640]   experience of Paris.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.040]   Parisians don't have a checklist of things.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   They actually enjoy the three-hour lunch.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.720]   They enjoy being able to just savor each aspect of the meal and to like talk to
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.360]   the waiter, not as just sort of another pawn in their game who's looking for a
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.000]   tip, but a guy who really knows the food and that's conversing with this person
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.200]   will help them have a better meal.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.040]   And the tables outside in French restaurants face out into the street so
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   that you're sitting next to your companion side by side, sort of interacting
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.160]   with the street and observing it.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.800]   And so I think if you don't allow yourself to just enjoy that three-hour
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.880]   lunch, even though it's way less efficient than an American lunch, you're
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.080]   not allowing yourself to enjoy Paris.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.280]   America, and I'm guilty of this.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.720]   Sometimes we eat lunch standing up so we can get on with our day.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.280]   But actually the experience of Paris is being able to savor a lunch in
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.520]   the way that French people do.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.280]   And if you don't allow yourself that experience, you're sort of cheating
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.480]   yourself out of a core experience of being in a place like France.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.000]   You talked about time well, you said it was this major unlock for you.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.240]   How can people take that concept and improve their mindset
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.120]   and improve their travel?
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.280]   I think it's a core shift in what you consider wealth is.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.240]   It's a matter of sort of letting what wealth you have serve you instead
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.040]   of shifting your existence to serve a certain idea of wealth.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.360]   I think oftentimes we go through all this trouble to reach certain
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.160]   goals, not realizing why we want them.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.320]   And I think wealth is a big one that there's certain metrics we use to
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.640]   judge wealth and one is money.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.960]   One is possessions, right?
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.880]   But I think the truest expression of wealth is being able to use this
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.240]   limited amount of time you have in your finite life.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.760]   We're all born equally rich in time when you think about it and finding
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.440]   ways to let that time enrich your life in a way that makes your dreams come true.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.680]   I talk about travel all the time.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.040]   So often I talk about time wealth in the context of travel.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.360]   It could be about spending more time with your kids.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.560]   For example, I meet travelers who go to the other side of the world and realize
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.160]   that comparatively poor countries like Uganda or Cambodia, being a father in
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.600]   those places is much more interactive with their kids.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.560]   They don't compartmentalize their fatherhood in those parts of the
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.720]   world like they do back home.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.680]   So they learn almost by accident, this idea of wealth as a manifestation
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   of how you spend your time.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.800]   And you know, one interesting person I talked to is Kevin Kelly.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.200]   I'm sure you're familiar with his work, co-founder of Wired.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.280]   He talks about how young people are richer in time than money and older
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.920]   people are richer in money than time.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.160]   And I think one reason why young people are stereotypically more given to long
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.040]   term travel is that they're in that situation.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.440]   They don't have more money than older people.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.920]   So they have less responsibilities.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   They have more of a willingness to forego certain comforts to get more time out of
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.600]   what money they do have in their wallet.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.840]   And so it really comes down to spending what money you do have in such a way
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.280]   that it makes your life more fulfilling.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.080]   Oftentimes we think that travel is something that we buy rather
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   than give to ourselves.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.520]   And if we can figure out how to travel within that local economy, how to travel
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.240]   in a way similar to how people in the country were visiting travel, I'm sure
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.440]   that's how you were able to get seven and a half months for seven and a half thousand
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:38.880]   dollars.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.320]   It's not by the big flashy stuff that you see advertised in glossy magazines
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.640]   or even on Instagram feeds.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.520]   It's the quieter, humbler, more interactive places where the people in
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.080]   West Africa or the people in Southeast Asia or wherever South America travel.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.800]   And it pays off in time.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.640]   That chicken bus probably goes slower and has less air conditioning than the nice
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.040]   tourist bus, but it puts you into a culture in a way that the tourist bus
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.520]   doesn't, and it costs a lot less.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.560]   It goes a lot slower and it pays off in that time wealth that we're talking about.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.960]   I could talk about time wealth all day.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.360]   It's really, really worth thinking about in the context of we have a limited
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.680]   wealth of time in life, and we should really take advantage of it and not put
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.640]   off our best self to another time of life.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.040]   We should grab this time and let it enrich our lives.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.560]   One fun anecdote, which is my wife worked early at Lyft and the origin
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.240]   story of the company was before it was Lyft, it was a company called Zimride.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.920]   And before it was Zimride, the name hadn't existed.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.520]   And one of the co-founders was in Africa riding one of those slow buses.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.000]   And that was the inspiration for starting Zimride, which became Lyft.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.480]   So you say the luxury bus might've been more fancy, but in this particular
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.000]   random case, taking that one bus ended up building a multi-billion dollar company.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.280]   So there is one anecdote of even that cheaper, slower, maybe sweatier
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.960]   bus could pay off for some people.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.120]   I generally think travel is an opportunity to see people doing different things,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.840]   different ways around the world.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.800]   And that makes you a more creative person, makes you a more curious
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.040]   person and leads to all kinds of things.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.320]   So it's funny that you use the one example that I happen to know
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.800]   ended up becoming a wild success.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.760]   But I think it's a fun story.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   I also think I had a conversation with my wife the other day, and
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.600]   we were talking about goals.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.320]   And we haven't really gone through this process of like, what are our goals
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.760]   for our family, for our finances, for our health, but we thought we have two
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.920]   daughters now, maybe we should, and my wife had this net worth financial goal.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.080]   And I pushed back to her and this connects back to time wealth.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.200]   But she said, I would love to hit this milestone.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.440]   And I said, okay, well, we could hit it, but would you be okay if that
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   meant either one of us was working a lot more and not spending as much time together?
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.720]   And she's like, well, no, I wouldn't want that.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.160]   And I was like, well, would you be okay if we moved to a different part of the
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   country that was cheaper, or we cut back on some of the things we do?
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.000]   And she's like, well, no, I wouldn't want to sacrifice those things.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.680]   And we had this conversation where in our minds, and this is purely part of the
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.440]   society we live in and the expectations we set on people, she had felt like we
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.040]   needed to like grow our net worth.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.680]   And in a way through this conversation about what we actually wanted to spend
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.600]   our time doing, we left being like, actually, maybe we need a smaller net
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.000]   worth, like maybe we need less, like Bill Perkins wrote this book, Die With Zero.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.240]   And the premise is like, why are we trying to amass all this money?
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   We should be trying to take the money we have and optimally use it to
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.480]   have the most fulfilling life.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   And in some cases, that might be actually not trying to grow and grow and grow
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.600]   your wealth, but maybe to find more creative ways to spend it or unlock time.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.240]   Yeah, no, I love this example.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.160]   Actually, I love this shared taxi from Africa example too.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.840]   But I think wealth is an abstraction.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.520]   It's often future oriented.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.920]   And one thing using children as a great example, because oftentimes we think of
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.320]   children in terms of them being potential adults, when in fact, the blessing of
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.200]   having them as children is having them right where they are, right?
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.600]   And so sure, it's good to create security and create good habits for your children.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.640]   But part of the pleasure of being a parent is like having them being a newborn that
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.200]   is gripping their finger with their whole fist, right?
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.120]   And just being able to enjoy that moment, regardless of what your
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.600]   net worth is in 20 years.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.040]   I think one danger of having arbitrary goals for net worth is that you become
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.360]   focused on those goals rather than that very transient experience that is
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.080]   parenthood, that each phase of your kid's life, it can be exhausting, of course.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.040]   But it's also so special.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.360]   It's just so exciting.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.640]   And then I think there's a different dynamic.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.200]   I remember sort of when I shifted from being this kid that was being raised by
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.920]   my parents to this traveler who was sort of hosting his parents and sort of being
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.160]   the expert in that they were the young, curious, naive people, even though they
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.120]   were my parents in a place like China or the Czech Republic.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.400]   And so I think, yeah, nothing against having goals or thinking about net worth
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.240]   or creating safety nets or steering children in such a way that they will
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.560]   become productive adults.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.240]   But just that blessing, I think often that cliche is, you know, enjoy them
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.920]   while they're toddlers, that'll be gone.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.080]   Enjoy them while they're infants.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.480]   Enjoy them while they're in grade school because you'll miss that.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.680]   Well, you really do need to embrace that.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.040]   And that sometimes if we're making decisions that are based on 20 year goals
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.080]   rather than just looking at our kids or looking at our life or looking at our
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.880]   travel, looking where we are, then we are relegating our lives to an abstract
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.120]   future instead of embracing the beauty of the moment.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.520]   You mentioned moving to another place.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.000]   I'm based in Kansas, which is a much less fashionable place than the Bay Area.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.880]   But one nice thing about that is that it just pays off.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.120]   I'm not a parent, actually.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.800]   I'm an uncle.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.280]   I love being an uncle, but it costs less to get through the day to achieve certain
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.240]   goals in life, and that pays off in free time.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.360]   And so I'm not saying that everybody needs to move to Kansas or to a cheap
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.400]   part of the world like Columbia, or there's a lot of places where digital
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.080]   nomads go because they can save money.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   But there are different tools, hacks, if you will, to take what money you do have
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.520]   to take what income and interests that you have and loves, be it from family or
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.920]   activities, and find a way to make them a more active part of your life.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.120]   I've talked about it on my own podcast that they love the mountains, but Oregon
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.480]   is hard to afford these days.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.640]   So they moved to Tennessee and they can hike three times a week in Tennessee
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.640]   for a quarter of the price of Oregon, right?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.280]   So I think that there's a lot of ways that if you can embrace the concept of
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.200]   time wealth and realize that there's different ways of freeing time up in
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.960]   your life, then you can really focus your life on those present moment goals that
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.840]   make life richer and more enjoyable and more fun and more rewarding and more
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.240]   likely to give back to things like family and community.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.080]   Is there a process or a framework that someone listening to this is thinking,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.400]   gosh, I really wish I could figure out what that means for me.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.360]   Are there questions you would propose someone think about to
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.760]   kind of figure out what they want?
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.160]   I would say that there are some questions like, well, what makes me
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.760]   happy in the course of a given day?
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.280]   And in the course of a given week, where is my happy time?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   And if it's, I'm so stressed out, it's watching cat videos on social media,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.600]   then maybe you should get a cat, right?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.720]   I think sometimes we assuage our stresses through distractions
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.240]   rather than passions and loves.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.200]   I think sometimes we don't know our passions.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.240]   I have nothing against college.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.520]   My father taught college, my sister teaches college.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.920]   And I think it's a very noble vocation, but sometimes we go to college
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.480]   without even knowing what we like to do.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.960]   And other cultures have gap years in the UK and Australia.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.920]   They have places, the gap year where you take a year off after secondary
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.600]   schooling, but before university, where you travel or you work.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   And that allows you to find out what you really love to do and where your
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.280]   passions are before you spend all this money going to university.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.000]   And so weirdly enough, I think that travel and maybe traveling for seven
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   and a half months or whatever is a great way to find out what you love.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.600]   I think there's what your parents think you should do.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   There's what your counselors think you should do.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.240]   I think oftentimes young people, but even older people, it's the same way
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.320]   that until you are off into the place completely away from the pressures
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.760]   and routines and constrictions of living at home, you can really
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.000]   find out where your heart lies.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.240]   You might sit in a village for a day and watch people build a house and think,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.440]   gosh, I want to build my own house or study architecture or something like that.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   That's just a random example.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.600]   One thing I talk about in the new book, in the context of a couple of monks
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.040]   from hundreds of years ago, the young monk talks to the older monk.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.640]   The older monk asked him a question about life and he says, "I don't know."
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.360]   And the older monk says, "Very good.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.680]   Not knowing is most intimate."
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.920]   I think it's good to embrace not knowing yet, not just how to live our
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.560]   lives, but what our goals are of just sort of being the person who's
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.880]   traveling through the world without a lot of plans yet, but having the
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:39.640]   faith to think eventually I'm going to really wander my way into something
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.240]   that makes my heart sing, that makes me fall in love with some aspect of life.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.320]   And that's going to be focused on it.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.440]   And that could be any number of things, including family.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.560]   For years, I lived next door to my parents.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.840]   My parents are now in assisted living.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.960]   They're not far from me now.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.160]   The whole lesson of living next door to one's parents, which is not a very
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.240]   common American thing, is very common in almost every other part of the
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   world, in Southeast Asia and Africa, pooling your resources and getting land.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   And that paid off, not just in the fact that I was able to save money, but I
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.600]   was able to spend some quality time with my parents at a really cool time in life.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.400]   And so I think there's a lot of different strategies into creating
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.000]   either on purpose or by accident.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.400]   And this whole familial thing was an accident that it was an idea about how
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   to live as a family that I didn't get until I was overseas, but there's ways
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   to allow yourself to grow into ways of being that you might not seem now.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.440]   You just need to allow yourself to sit still for a while and stop distracting
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.280]   yourself and start embracing things in life.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.920]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.640]   I get it.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.920]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.200]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.280]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.720]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.760]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.600]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.000]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.480]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.800]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.160]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.080]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.000]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.200]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.560]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.400]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.200]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.200]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.160]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:53.720]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.520]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.600]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.840]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.880]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.720]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.240]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.080]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.680]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.800]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.520]   investments.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.880]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.040]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.200]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.160]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.800]   market investment opportunities.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.760]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.920]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.320]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.840]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.760]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.080]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.880]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle and
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   it's totally free to join.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.800]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.640]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.320]   Again, that's longangle, A N G L E.com.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.240]   It seems like spending a lot of time with family, you picked up quite easily
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.280]   because it's so common in the rest of the world.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.200]   Are there other major things that have affected the way you live your life
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.680]   now that are kind of themes that travel has brought you aside from just traveling?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.960]   Right.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.600]   Well, travel is so much a part of things, but I think if we can see is
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.480]   travel is more than a consumer act that are certain commonalities
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.760]   that we see again and again.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.920]   And family is one of them.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.360]   I've often said that when I was traveling through Southeast Asia, I was 27 years
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.120]   old, people would say, "Oh, are you married?
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.640]   Do you have kids?"
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   And I said, "No, no, I don't."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.000]   And they're like, "Oh, I'm sorry."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.920]   Like it was such a core value in this part of the world that I got the sense
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.120]   from them that their happiness was so tied into family, into marriage and
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.640]   children and relationships with family, that it seemed weird that I comparatively
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.680]   rich and mobile guy would not have that as a core value.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.560]   I think food, another one to get to be very simple, like in France, that's
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.360]   not the only place where meals are much slower and more communal than we have.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.400]   And our standing up, posting to Instagram while we're sipping
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   our latte, first world society.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   And so I think it's really these basic building block things that travel
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.040]   has taught me to come home to.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.880]   Another great thing about France, but it's also something that you'll see in
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.560]   Africa or Asia is, is eating food that was obviously grown within 20 miles
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.400]   of where you're eating it, of biting into a cherry in France and feeling
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.000]   cheated because you didn't realize cherries could taste that good.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.920]   And it's not some magical French thing.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.600]   It's just that French place value on seasonal produce.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.560]   You know, they're not flying in cherries from Chile in the middle of the winter.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.640]   There's a certain time in late June, early July when it's cherry season.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.800]   And that's when you eat your cherries.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   Obviously travel has given me philosophical perspectives
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.760]   with things like time wealth, but it's often these basic building
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.240]   block themes, love for family, concern about food that I bring home
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.280]   and try to bake into my travel life.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.640]   And then also just not rushing and multitasking things, being able to slow
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.280]   down and let a day happen instead of micromanaging and trying to rush
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.160]   through it to be somehow ahead of your competitive neighbor at the end of the
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.560]   day, not to fetishize other cultures, because I'm a big fan of American
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.280]   culture, but I think sometimes we're throwing too much at life and not
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.640]   sitting still as just another great lesson I've had from travel is the
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.160]   ability to sit still and let a day happen in a way that really enriches it.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.920]   And that can happen in a comparatively wealthy country like Norway,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.080]   where we went for the first time this summer, or a comparatively poor
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.560]   country like Indonesia, where I went a few years ago.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.520]   It's really fun to intertwine one's home life with lessons learned from travel.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.720]   I'm sure you discovered a lot of things on your own journey
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.760]   and the journeys you've had since.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.640]   So many.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.520]   I'd love to talk a little bit about how you have the kinds
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.640]   of experiences in a new place.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.960]   Obviously we mentioned, look, if you land in Paris and you go straight
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.680]   to a hotel and from your hotel to the Louvre, and then from there to a
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.240]   reservation, you're going to kind of miss it.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.920]   But are there things that you try to do and how you structure your time
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.480]   in a place, how long you're there, what you do first that kind of allow
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.040]   you to immerse yourself in a new place?
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.000]   Well, one of the catchphrases from Vagabonding that I refreshed in the
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.800]   new book, The Vagabond's Way, is walk until your day becomes interesting.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.440]   And I think we often don't give ourselves credit for just showing up in a place
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.840]   and walking around without really knowing where we're going or having any goals
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.160]   or checklists and just sort of walking until you sort of get a sense for the
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.000]   pace of a place instead of sightseeing, maybe smellseeing, follow the smells
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.160]   around a neighborhood and just find ways to slow down and realize that quotidian
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.760]   things are as amazing as sightseeing places.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.920]   To use Paris as an example, they have a convenience store.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.440]   It's an equivalent of 7-Eleven.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.360]   It's called the Carrefour.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.480]   There's also a Monoprix.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.720]   And just realizing that it's a little bit different than the American equivalent.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   Another thing I write about in the new book is getting a haircut in Egypt
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.360]   on Zamalek Island in Cairo, which like took an hour and had 23 steps
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.000]   and cost $6, including tip.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.440]   One, it was the best haircut of my life, but it was just a haircut, right?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.960]   It also gave me a perspective on the meticulousness of Arab masculinity
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.440]   as pertains to appearance.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.800]   And so I had this wonderful experience just by willing myself to get
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.400]   a haircut in a foreign place.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.200]   So I have nothing against sightseeing.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.680]   I have nothing against tourist districts.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.000]   I think it's pretty normal to go to places you've dreamed about.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.840]   If you're in Egypt, sure.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.080]   Go to the pyramids.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.760]   It'd be silly not to go to the pyramids, but get a haircut, go to the local market,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.680]   go to a sweet shop.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.360]   A great thing about Egypt specifically is that they take their sweets very seriously.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.520]   Like way more than your average hostess ding dong.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.040]   They have these handmade sweets that are amazing and dirt cheap and really fun to see.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.560]   I'm curious, like you had a seven and a half months around the world.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.760]   Did you have any go-to strategies when you landed in a place after you were a
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.000]   little bit salty as a traveler?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.040]   No matter what the purpose of the trip was, we try to always walk towards the food
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.600]   market or the market.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.640]   It doesn't have to be a food market.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.240]   In Turkey, there are more markets and a lot of Arab cultures.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.760]   It's just like everything's going on in the market.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   There's food stands, there's shopping.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.440]   In some places it's really more of a food market and you go early.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.400]   In Indonesia, like the food market's closed by 10, 11 in the morning because
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.440]   everyone's there right in the morning to get food.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.760]   And all the senses are kind of a part of a food market.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.280]   But it's also true, you know, in the fish market in Tokyo, it's like just people
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.200]   running around, bumping around, what's going on.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.600]   I feel like that is my favorite place to kind of get my bearings of a city.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.560]   It's like, what are people eating?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.320]   What are they drinking?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.360]   Are they negotiating?
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.720]   Are they a yelling culture?
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.800]   Are they a friendly culture?
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.400]   Like you could see it all in this one place and you could eat, you know, you
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.320]   could do it on your own.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.280]   I kind of love just going on a tour somewhere with some local of a food
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   market and getting a lay of like, what do we eat in this culture?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.160]   How do people shop?
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.120]   How do people buy?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.680]   I don't know how you feel about hiring tour guides versus just walking solo.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.560]   I think there's room for both for me, but that's where I start almost everything.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.280]   And I mean, we went on our honeymoon to the Seychelles, but we
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.760]   still went to the food market.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.200]   I think it was a fish market downtown because we were like, even if the goal
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.680]   is to relax, like we still want to feel the culture here.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.080]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.600]   And I think sometimes travelers will go to a market and they'll walk through the
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.200]   whole thing, but they'll only go to the, like the jewelry stand or the brass
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.720]   figurine stand, like the obviously souvenir thing.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.680]   But I love the idea of getting ingredients for a meal.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.880]   Even if this vegetable, you don't even know what it is yet.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.280]   It helps to have a place for the kitchen.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.200]   Of course, there's just so many times where tourists will spend like an hour
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.960]   and one of the most famous markets in the world, and they'll go to a restaurant.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.880]   It's like, no, don't buy food, get a picnic, get those figs and that tea or
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.800]   whatever, and have an adventure of it.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.280]   And you mentioned a guide sometimes early in the travels, like in your first days
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.400]   in a place, I don't often get guides, but I'm not opposed to it because sometimes
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.480]   the guides can help you negotiate things and they can explain like, oh yeah, no,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.680]   actually this isn't a fruit, it's a spice.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.480]   And we use it in this soup for this reason.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.280]   And it's worth the monetary investment because it gives you a headstart on
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.360]   understanding how life works there.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.880]   I love market cultures.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   I also love market squares too, because oftentimes there's like a soccer game or
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.560]   people are playing foosball.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.880]   It immediately insinuates yourself into the daily life of a place.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.120]   Because again, Parisians aren't usually standing in line for the mosque.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.920]   Egyptians aren't usually taking a tour bus to the great pyramids.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   They're doing different things.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.520]   Like Cairo and Paris, two of my favorite places in the world, really reward that
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.720]   walk through the market, like in Paris, for example, different markets will be
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.680]   open on different days.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.080]   In Cairo, the best oranges I've ever had.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.920]   I've gotten in a market in Cairo for pennies.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.640]   Who would have guessed?
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.400]   But I was just wandering around and it's like, yeah, I'll get this orange.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.560]   That's half the size of my head.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.000]   Why not?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.800]   And it was delicious.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.640]   And I think those are the surprises.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.760]   There's no app for that.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.440]   There's no micromanaged way to wander into those awesome market moments where
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.280]   suddenly you're eating this fruit that you didn't realize existed.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.160]   And now you're on your fifth one because it's amazing.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.920]   And you're in Indonesia and it's a lot of fun.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.360]   That was jackfruit for me.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.400]   I had never heard of jackfruit my whole life.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.040]   I tried it now.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:47.920]   I'm like, I love it.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.600]   My daughter is two and she's obsessed with jackfruit.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.960]   So I'm like finding myself trying to find the Asian grocery store to go buy more
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.520]   jackfruit.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   I didn't even know it was a thing.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.760]   I just saw it and I was like, what is this?
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.680]   They're like, it's kind of like a banana, maybe a pineapple, a little bit mixed.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.600]   And it's my favorite.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.800]   Well, that's something you can take home too.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.240]   You were talking before just like what attitudes do I take home?
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.160]   Well, sometimes it is the simplest one is food.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.600]   Like for my birthday last year, my wife took me to a Korean restaurant way out
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.400]   and like probably an hour from here.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.640]   Well, I was so excited because every time I eat Korean food, it reminds me of being
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   back in Korea in a way I can always take a little bit of my heart back to Korea
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.440]   when I'm eating kimchi and bulgogi.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.680]   Right.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.520]   So that's a big part of it.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.200]   It's like suddenly these places are in conversation with each other.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:23.600]   I'm curious.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.680]   Do you have any rituals that are sort of born of travel?
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.360]   Do you have any things at home that were sort of baked in by your journeys and
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.000]   other places?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.280]   When it comes to food, I'd say 50% of the foods that we cook are not traditional
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.840]   American foods.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.120]   We cook a lot of Korean food because we just, we love Korean food.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.760]   So when we go to places, the gifts I try to bring people, I'm like, oh, let's bring
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   some smoked paprika from Hungary.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.560]   Hungary, I think has a lot, I could be totally wrong here, but I think it was
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.320]   Hungary has a lot of paprika.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.400]   So like I brought home everyone paprika and the things we bring people are things
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.880]   to help them experience something kind of satiating, like a drink, an alcohol, a
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.400]   spirit, a spice.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.160]   That's one.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.760]   I can't remember where I was that I experienced raclette.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.280]   We bought a raclette grill.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.960]   My wife has since it's been this sore subject in our house, which is like, we
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   never use this thing.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.520]   And I'm like, no, but one day we will.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.120]   And she's like, we've got to get rid of it.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.360]   It hasn't been touched in two years.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.400]   It's caked on with dust.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.040]   But I think food is something that when we're in another country, it's like, I
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.440]   only want to eat local.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.160]   In India, it was like, I will risk sickness to be able to eat the food on the
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.520]   street, drink the chai tea.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.960]   Just that's travel a lot for me is kind of understanding that.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.400]   And ideally talking to people about it.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.480]   I think the experiences that have happened once we've come home are always
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.440]   being able to connect the dots in strange ways.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.320]   A great example was we were in the park, just five minute walk from our house the
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.840]   other day, and all these people are dancing.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.000]   And I was like, why is everybody dancing?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.160]   This is not a park where there's normally dancing, but there's a bunch of kids and
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.560]   adults all dancing and eating.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.640]   And I asked him, I said, what's going on?
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.680]   And they're like, oh, we're celebrating because it was the Lebanese festival.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.440]   Last weekend and all these kids danced in a parade.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.200]   And so now we're kind of celebrating here.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.080]   And my daughter runs up to the middle of the group, a woman picks her up.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.560]   And it's funny because I think many Americans would be terrified if a random
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.600]   person in a park starts picking up and dancing with your kid, but we were like,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.840]   oh, you know, I've been to Lebanon and like the culture is just so welcoming.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.560]   We ended up spending two hours there, having meals, talking about our trip to
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.600]   Lebanon and having a way to connect with people.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.000]   And it turns out we live half a mile from a Lebanese church.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.120]   And they're like, come on.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.640]   Every second and fourth Sunday is like when we have all the families there and
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.000]   we do all these events and gatherings.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.080]   We don't care if you practice whatever religion just come.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.480]   We love meeting people who understand and are excited to learn more about our
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.360]   culture. And so I think one cool thing to take away and depending where in the
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.080]   country you are, it could be harder, easier, but you don't have to go halfway
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.720]   around the world to have a really immersive cultural experience that's far
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   different from where you are.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.960]   We try to have those experiences when we're traveling, but we also try to have
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.480]   those experiences here and find the pockets of a city that are, you know, lots
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.920]   of Korean restaurants or lots of people doing XYZ and try to do that while we're
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.640]   here. Because for us, like we can't always be traveling.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   And with two small kids, it's hard, but it's not hard to necessarily go to a
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.360]   local Korean restaurant or meet a bunch of Lebanese people dancing in the park.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.880]   That's awesome. It's great that you had a kid that was just completely fearless
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.200]   and just ran in and sort of insinuated in that situation.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.080]   Kids are actually a great travel tool.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.040]   I have a lot of old traveler friends who, you know, they get married and they
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.480]   start to have kids and they're worried that it's going to cut into their travel
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.640]   experience. You know what I can, because kids need a certain structure and
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.840]   discipline on the road. But I found that people around the world love kids and
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.760]   they don't really need a common language to pick up a kid and admire how cute it
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.640]   is. And so kids can really be a window into a place.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.240]   And when they get to a certain age, not only are they fearless, but they have no
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.440]   preconceptions about what is or isn't important.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.840]   I have a chapter in The Vagabond's Way about I went with my nephew to Père
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.400]   Lachaise Cemetery in France and he was 14.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.640]   And usually you go there and it's like, oh, here's Jim Morrison's grave or
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.120]   here's Oscar Wilde's grave or here's Abelard and Eloise.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.240]   Well, he was 14. He didn't know who any of these people were.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.280]   Jim Morrison died the year I was born, so he barely knew who the Doors were.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.160]   But he just was curious about everything.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.760]   He's like, well, why are there all these flowers on this grave?
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   His name is Frank Alamo.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.360]   It's like, well, I don't know. And he's like, you don't know who Frank Alamo is?
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.280]   It's like, I've been here for 10 times, but I don't know.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.520]   So we looked it up and Frank Alamo is like this sort of Elvis style pop
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.960]   star who just died in France.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.320]   And there's this other grave in the cemetery that had all these hammers and
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.240]   weasels carved into this giant grave.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.720]   And it was this Russian princess who her fortune was made on iron and fur,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.280]   hence the hammers and the weasels.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.080]   It's just sort of this strange mystery that basically all he brought to this
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.760]   place was his imagination because he was a 14 year old kid.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.200]   And suddenly I was learning things in a cemetery that I'd been to several times.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.680]   And so I think kids can be a great travel tool because not only are they just
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.520]   excited that people are dancing, but also they humanize you to other people.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.920]   It's one thing to be a couple of outsiders in a group, but outsiders with kids who
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.720]   are excited about things, then suddenly you're one of them.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.520]   In a certain way, a family is a very recognizable unit around the world.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.000]   It's a great window into places.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.600]   I know you don't have children, but you've got your nephew.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.040]   I'm sure you've had more travel conversations than probably anyone listening.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.200]   Are there tips that you've picked up from others that you'd give to people with
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.880]   kids trying to think, gosh, you know, travel can be stressful with children.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   That seems like too much, how to make it easier, how to make it feel more
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.480]   approachable?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.360]   Well, again, a structure is something that they need more than your average
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.320]   dirtbag traveler.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.200]   They need sort of need a sense for how each day works, but maybe also take them
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.440]   into environments that do capture their imagination, maybe environments where
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.320]   there are other kids.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.280]   We default, it's just sort of a museums and cathedrals way of travel, which is
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.560]   fine and interesting, but it's sort of more abstracted.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.720]   It's more tied into things like history or religion or wherever.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.600]   We're sometimes just a random park.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.120]   Like now I feel like if somebody is in the Bay area, they should go to this
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.480]   park where you found that dance.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.520]   Like basically any park where people are having fun is a window into a place and
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.560]   kids at the end of the day, love to run around.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.360]   And there's so many places, preferably away from heavy traffic where kids can run
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.080]   around and suddenly you're hanging out and your kids are opening doors into a
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.240]   place that you wouldn't have noticed before because kids don't need to have a
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.120]   common language to run around and have fun.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.360]   And sometimes they'll talk to each other and have perfect conversations without
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.040]   realizing they don't really speak the same language at a certain age.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   And so I think just sort of that openness and realizing that it's a
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.680]   lot simpler than you think.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.800]   I think we can sometimes micromanage parenthood in the United States.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.320]   We have our special backpack full of the sippy cup and the iPad and all these
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.440]   things that we feel like we need to keep a kid occupied.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.920]   But in fact, a green space where they can run around with other kids is great.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.560]   Actually that market, I'm sure kids would be really excited visually and
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.040]   centrally by a market to use a metaphor that would make sense when I was a kid.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.400]   It's like something from Star Wars.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.920]   It's like the cantina scene from Star Wars where the music is different and
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.800]   the food is different.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.000]   And in this kid-like way, it's like you're on another planet.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.040]   And so I think allowing your kids to engage their imaginations in a way that
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.600]   we as parents and elders sometimes have ceased to do is a great way to make them
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.240]   great travel allies and to sort of follow their example of being kid-like in a
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.560]   place that we don't understand, but we can be engaged by.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.240]   I want to talk a little bit about slow travel, but I think that is also a big
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.680]   thing. I haven't done this yet.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.200]   Our kids are two and four months, but we've thought about travel.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.360]   It's like, what if instead of trying to take a week trip to Italy, we take a
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.240]   month trip, we find some Airbnb, we could rent our place out here while we're
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.200]   gone so that the cost of the trip is a little cheaper, or maybe we find a family
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   and stay with them or something and get to know people.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.160]   But when you're there, you can create the routine there.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.240]   There's not as much pressure of, oh, well, we have to do all this stuff because
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.400]   we're only here for four days.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.720]   It's like, well, today we're going to go to the park.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.360]   Maybe we're going to sit at a cafe.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.040]   We'll come home. You can take a nap like we don't have to get it all done.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.960]   And I think I'm really excited to do a little bit more of that style travel,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.040]   which we did on our big trip because we didn't have the money.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.720]   So we were just like, oh, we're going to stay in the city for a week because we
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.880]   can't afford to keep moving.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.520]   I think that could be something valuable to do with kids instead of the
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.200]   traditional late 20s kind of trip where you're just like, go, go, go through
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.680]   everything. That's great experience more by doing less.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.160]   And in fact, you live in a very popular part of the United States.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.360]   There's actually home exchanges.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.560]   You can find somebody in Italy who wants to live in the Bay Area for a while.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.440]   There are online sites where you can do home exchanges.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.680]   I want to do a little bit of research here, but it's like, what are the odds
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.080]   that there's a person in Italy who wants to come to the Bay Area the same week I
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.120]   want to go to it? Like, have you heard good success stories from people doing
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.240]   this? Absolutely.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.120]   Some of the students in my Paris class from the Bay Area have done home swaps.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   OK, they basically find a place to stay during my class in Paris while the French
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.880]   family is enjoying a California vacation of their own.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.400]   There's no silver bullet. It's not a perfect thing, but it's very doable,
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.520]   especially if you live in a part of the United States where people from other
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.600]   countries would like to live in themselves.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.880]   And then the great thing about being with a family in a place is that doing
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.240]   chores, washing dishes, you're basically routine.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.160]   You're suddenly doing it in a more Italian way.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.760]   I guarantee when you walk down the same street for the third day in a row with
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   your super cute kids, the guy that owns the pastry shop is going to come out with
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.960]   a little snack for your kids.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.120]   Basically, you become a part of the habit of that neighborhood.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.960]   I think sometimes tourists, even backpackers, are ghosts.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.680]   They're there for a couple of days and they're gone.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.680]   And so you can't really develop relationships.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.480]   Whereas in for a month, it can be really special if there's this American family
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.760]   that's suddenly in the village and they don't speak the language that well.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.560]   And they're sort of cute when they order the food because they get the words
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.680]   wrong. But then suddenly you have this new enlivened empathy simply because
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.240]   instead of being part of a touristic routine in a place, you've joined the
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.480]   daily routine of the people who live there.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.960]   And then suddenly you and your family or you and your partner or you as a person
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.120]   alone are experiencing a place in a very rich way that is not taking five
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.360]   countries off your list, but it's taking one community, for example, a month.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.760]   And you're really going deep in a way that you're probably more likely to think
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.400]   about it in your old age, that one month in the beautiful Italian village, than
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   if you'd been racing to five different countries in that one month during the
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.600]   same time. So I'm a big fan of slow travel.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.200]   It's funny because you talked earlier about getting your hair cut.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.280]   And I think back to our trip around the world and some of the most memorable
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.840]   moments and mine, too, was getting my hair cut in Nairobi by someone who was
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.120]   terrified because I've never cut a white person's hair in my whole life.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.560]   And I was like, look, I promise you, you can't mess this up.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.680]   Like, I don't care.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.000]   It wasn't quite as long as your experience, but it was so much fun.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.200]   And we had a great conversation.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.920]   And I remember that infinitely more than probably I mean, I can't even tell you
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.120]   the restaurant that maybe someone recommended I go to or was the highest
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.560]   rated. And we went to I don't know what it was.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.400]   I don't remember dinner out in Nairobi, but I do remember that haircut.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   And so I think that's interesting.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.840]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:58.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes, deals

[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.840]   You mentioned checking items off a list.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.240]   I'm curious how you feel about people creating bucket lists.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.440]   Is that something that you're like anti bucket list?
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.160]   You like it. How do you feel about the concept?
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.120]   Well, I have a whole mini chapter about bucket lists.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.840]   I'm not anti bucket list, but you really have to understand that the bucket list
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.320]   is what gets you out the door because so many items on the bucket list, the
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.680]   pyramids being a great example.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.560]   Well, there's a lot of tourist buses there.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.120]   There's a lot of Egyptians there who are part of the tourist industry, and they
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.480]   want you to pay a hundred dollars to sit on a camel, which is fine.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.200]   But I think five hours spent in a neighborhood market in Cairo is going to
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.880]   be more rewardingly Egyptian than you would have five hours waiting in line
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.240]   and going around and getting your pictures for Instagram at the pyramids.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.440]   I'm not going to say don't go to the pyramids, but I'm just going to say that
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.640]   the things that you find by accident on the way to the various items on your
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.600]   bucket list are probably going to be the things that make you happiest.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.200]   Not to make this all about haircuts, but I was driving in New
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.600]   Orleans with my friend Dan once.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.720]   And he just said, I'm sick of my hair.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.400]   I need a haircut.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.360]   So we just pulled off the road.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.840]   We just happened to be in Canton, Mississippi.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.040]   We pulled into a place, it was a black neighborhood.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.320]   And we go into a barbershop and the guy's like, I've never cut
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.040]   white hair, but I got this.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.920]   This is the United States.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.840]   And we sort of made the day of everybody in this black barbershop.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.640]   It was sort of this collective effort.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.160]   Let's cut Dan's hair.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.240]   He doesn't have the naturally kinky black hair that the people
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.000]   in this neighborhood have.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.120]   But let's figure this out because in Canton, Mississippi, white people
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.600]   never come into this barbershop.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.800]   And so it was this funny thing.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.440]   It wasn't the best haircut that my friend Dan ever got, but we sort of made their
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.040]   day because in a town where there's still elements of segregation and white
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.960]   people just don't swagger into the barbershop in the black part of town.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.800]   Suddenly we had this experience that whatever lack of proficiency that in
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.920]   the haircut was, it was super memorable and super fun where suddenly we were
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.800]   just sort of casually hanging out in a black barbershop in Canton, Mississippi
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.240]   because we needed a haircut and it was as memorable as anything we found on
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.680]   the way to New Orleans, right?
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.160]   So we had a blast in New Orleans.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   I'm not going to knock that.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.600]   But part of what was fun were that the things that happened away from Bourbon
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.680]   street or the other things that you're supposed to see in New Orleans or on
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.520]   the way to New Orleans itself, stopping in this town that we didn't really know
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.280]   much about before we randomly walked into a barbershop to get a haircut.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.240]   So I think being willing, even as you seek out items on your bucket list to
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.480]   surprise yourself and to sort of foolishly wander into a barbershop that isn't
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.640]   necessarily used to cutting your kind of hair, that can be super memorable.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.040]   It was obviously memorable for you in Kenya, and it was memorable
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.000]   for us in Mississippi.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.200]   I mean, I think this juxtaposes something really fascinating, which is
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.680]   I think, oh, I had this experience.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.840]   I had to go halfway around the world to get my haircut by someone who'd never
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.560]   cut a white person's hair and hear you do it straight in the United States.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.280]   And I think so much of travel and I'm guilty of this myself.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.840]   It's like in order to have these crazy experiences or unique experiences
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   or different experiences, you have to go halfway around the world.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.280]   Can you help me get over that?
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.680]   This was one example, but how do you feel about the fact that I feel like
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.120]   there's all this pressure to have to travel?
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.280]   You need to hop on a plane and cross an ocean.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.080]   Yeah, well, a couple of things came to mind.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.560]   One is a concept of a walk until your day becomes interesting.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.360]   Like just going for counterintuitive walks in your own neighborhood
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.120]   or in one neighborhood over
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.360]   even walking to work or driving to work in a way that you're not used to doing.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.000]   Just sort of finding different patterns in your home environment
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.960]   on foot can be really interesting.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   One thing I talk about in The Vagabond's Way is during the pandemic,
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.440]   my wife and I were itchy to travel, but we really couldn't.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.280]   So we decided we couldn't go see your cousins in Norway.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.920]   So we decided to walk to a town in Kansas called Little Sweden.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   It was 22 miles from our front door to Little Sweden.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.160]   It took us seven hours.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.400]   Our feet hurt really bad.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   But it was so fun to see this little landscape of the Kansas countryside
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.280]   on foot through a method that we had never seen before.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.520]   So that was really fun.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.080]   Even simpler than walking 22 miles to Little Sweden is these food experiences.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.320]   And I think one fun thing about the barbershop experience in Mississippi
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.120]   is that we had broken an unwritten rule, which is white people
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   don't get their hair cut in black neighborhoods, right?
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:02.040]   Well, oftentimes we go to places that are "dangerous" in our own hometown.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.680]   But even places where poorer people live, they have to eat lunch.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   What's it like to go to a cafeteria counter in a neighborhood we don't usually go to?
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.040]   And so I think sometimes we realize that there's a wealth of
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.600]   cultural options in our own town just because we're sort of in the habit
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.480]   of our own social class or our own bubble of familiarity in our home.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.760]   And that sometimes a neighborhood that's sort of seen as a barrio neighborhood
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.640]   probably has the best Mexican and Latin American food in your own community.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.480]   It might just be a storefront that's next to a television repair shop.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.920]   But odds are that food is really great.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.280]   And the price of doing it is just being willing to go to that part of town
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.760]   where maybe not as many people speak English as they do in your own neighborhood
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.840]   and going to a place where people who might have a generation ahead of them
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.600]   still living in Mexico, and suddenly you're eating food in a context.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.720]   Actually, speaking of Mexico specifically, my sister, who teaches college
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   in a little Sweden town here in Kansas, she realized that most of the Mexican
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.160]   people who worked at local restaurants and stuff didn't just come from Mexico,
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.200]   but they came from Zacatecas, they came from a place called Fresnillo.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.360]   And she realized that there were buses that go from central
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   Kansas to Zacatecas for 10 or 20 bucks.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.280]   You can go to Mexico on the same buses that migrant workers
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.480]   go to see their family, right?
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.320]   And so just by asking, just like pushing the envelope,
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.440]   but not just going to the Mexican restaurant by saying,
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   where exactly in Mexico are you?
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.720]   How often do you see your family?
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.800]   Really, there's a shuttle service that goes to Wichita
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.880]   that takes you to a bigger bus that goes to Dallas.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.760]   It takes you to an even bigger bus that takes you to the border.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.640]   And then you take Mexican buses home.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.840]   She actually was able to create an adventure to Mexico with her family
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.480]   that cost nothing.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.520]   And they were able to instead of hanging out with tourists
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.080]   going to Mexico to Cancun, nothing against Cancun,
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.560]   but basically they took a bus full of people who work in the service
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.680]   economy of central Kansas, and they were able to get to see a part of Mexico
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.440]   that they never would have otherwise seen
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.840]   because they're willing to see a part of Kansas that they had never otherwise seen.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.080]   So I think food in immigrant communities is a huge window.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.720]   Even if you don't end up on a minibus to Mexico, being willing to just unfold
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.800]   the layers in immigrant communities in your own hometown
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.080]   is a great way to experience travel while you're still home.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.560]   So there are a few things we haven't touched on that I'd love to talk about
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.480]   briefly. I know you took this trip about, I don't know, a decade ago
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.240]   where you just literally had no bag.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.800]   So first off, that's wild.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.480]   We did no checked bags, which I think is doable.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.040]   TBD on whether how doable it is with small kids.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.640]   But what did you learn from going on a trip with no bags?
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.840]   And what does that change now?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.160]   What do you not take on trips now?
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.920]   Well, one thing I learned almost immediately that this big central
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.800]   core conflict in telling a story about traveling the world with no luggage
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.160]   became pretty easy, pretty fast.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.400]   I was traveling with a sponsor.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.080]   I had a vest full of things where I could put things in my pockets.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.320]   And I got used to that system very early.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.840]   And people would often say, well, gosh, I wouldn't want to sit next to an airplane.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.640]   You must smell bad.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.360]   And it's like, no, I actually showered every day and I washed my clothes every day.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.000]   At the end of the day, I would take off the clothes
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.800]   I was wearing, shower with them, dry them up for the next day.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.160]   And I would just rotate two sets of clothes.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.760]   So I was actually very clean.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.600]   And once I got used to it, it was pretty simple to do.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.520]   And early on, my sponsors are saying, well, should we contact
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.640]   the Guinness Book of World Records? I don't think this has ever been done.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.320]   And it's like, have you heard of refugees?
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.160]   Have you heard of merchants that have been traveling the world forever?
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.480]   Like the idea that you have to travel the world
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.800]   with a bunch of giant bags is pretty new in a certain sense.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.400]   And so the first lesson I learned is that once I sort of got into my meticulous
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.240]   cleanliness routines, I didn't really miss my bags that much.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.920]   Now, this has not made me a full time, no baggage traveler,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.360]   because but what it did make me realize is that it's not that hard
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.000]   to take a small day pack or like 30 liter or less backpack with you
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.680]   that you can put in the overhead bin, because at the end of the day,
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.880]   what I was most relieved not to have were the giant bags
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.280]   that I had to check under the plane or drag around over the cobblestones
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.160]   or to grunt through the tropical country with sweat dripping down my brow.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.560]   I realized that my kit, whether it be in pockets or in a relatively small bag,
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.400]   you don't really need that much to have a great time when you travel.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.600]   And in a sense, our best travel memories aren't about the crap
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.920]   that we put in our backpack.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.520]   It's about this awesome thing that we found in the village square.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.320]   It's about these people we met or it's this experience we had.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.360]   Or at the very least, it's about something that we got
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.160]   and we put in our backpack and brought home from the other side of the world
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.480]   to commemorate this memory of a great experience we had before.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.680]   So it's such an instructive trip.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.600]   And to this day, I haven't really done anything that compares to going
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.200]   literally with no baggage for six weeks around the world.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.680]   It was a blast to do.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.640]   But it's really leavened to me.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.240]   Like three years ago, I traveled around the world for three months
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.320]   with one 30 liter bag, and it was easy.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.200]   And in fact, I still felt like sometimes I was overpacked.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.320]   At the end of the day, it just didn't take that much for me
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.600]   to have a great time and have everything I needed.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.440]   And one final thought about that.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's even easier these days with so much on your smartphone
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.280]   to help guide your trip from GPS maps to language translators.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.880]   There's fewer things that you do have to pack in your bags.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.560]   Of course, this brings up the can of worms of your phone
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.720]   can actually distract from your travel experience, too.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.760]   But no, there's really no longer any reason to take a bunch of stuff
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.360]   around the world, just discipline yourself into taking the bare minimum
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.560]   and letting the world provide the rest, including experiences.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.680]   Are there any items that you're like, yeah, this one particular brand of shoes
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.120]   or sweater is like the thing that I always bring now?
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.480]   Is there anything for you that's like your go to travel item?
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.560]   Besides my Kindle, I don't want to sing the praise of Kindle too much
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.600]   because I'm a big fan of independent bookstores and my new book is out in hardcover.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.080]   It's my fifth book, but it's the first time I have a book in hardcover.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.360]   But like the Kindle allows me to take my library with me. I love it.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.440]   There's certain clothing items.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.120]   I'm a fan of merino wool, for example.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.720]   I'm a fan of my 30 liter pack.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.440]   I'm a fan of Blundstone boots.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.200]   They're not a sponsor.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.560]   Actually, my merino wool and my pack are sponsors
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.600]   because Vagabonding is such an old book.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.800]   People have actually started travel product companies and said,
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.160]   look, Vagabonding inspired this.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.480]   So it's like, oh, y'all wear it. This is pretty good.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.440]   Blundstone boots out of Australia is not one of those companies.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.640]   I think they've been making them since the 19th century.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   I love Blundstones. They don't have laces.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.920]   You can slip them on and slip them off.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.000]   They're very sturdy.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.960]   They look good.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.280]   They look as good in a nightclub as they do on a mountain trail.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.800]   So I'm a big fan of that.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.600]   But it's not that many things.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   My Kindle, my boots, a few toiletries, my merino wool.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.640]   And I'm a pretty minimalist traveler, and I'm happy traveling that way.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.000]   Well, you brought up the phone, so I feel like it'd be a good place to go.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.280]   I thought about the first international trip I took that I remember.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.640]   I took some as a young kid,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.560]   but the first one that I was like on my own without my parents.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.200]   And I went to Taiwan when I was a freshman or sophomore in college
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.920]   because I'd gone to boarding school.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.200]   My roommate in high school was in Taiwan.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.600]   I was like, I want to go visit him.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.840]   And I was like, gosh, we didn't have iPhones.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.680]   So I was like thinking about this trip and all the things we did.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.440]   I was like, well, I guess we just relied on,
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.200]   you know, locals and instincts and just it didn't matter.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.080]   Now I think about trips and the way technologies changed,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.680]   both for the better and the worse, the experience of being somewhere.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.600]   I know you've challenged people to leave their phones behind
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.280]   at different parts of trips.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   How do you think technology has changed things?
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.560]   And how can we still have the kinds of experiences
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.080]   that we all want to have and not get distracted?
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.360]   Well, I remember that first wave of technology
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.520]   that really allowed us to travel in a different way.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:12.040]   In fact, my example is my first Vagabond trip was 1994.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.240]   I was living in a van and I would call my parents once a week with my calling card.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.600]   This is before I used email.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.640]   Five years later, I was living in Asia,
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   and it felt like a luxury to be able to email my family.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.800]   I was in closer touch with my family from Mongolia than I was from Oklahoma.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.480]   Right. Just five years earlier, around that same time, that was 1999.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.600]   I remember there are some articles,
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.480]   I think, in the San Francisco Chronicle about how virtual reality
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.680]   will allow you to travel the world without leaving your home. Right.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.400]   Well, now that we have the smartphone,
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.360]   now that we have this little black mirror in our pockets,
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.000]   we can be traveling the world without really leaving home in the habit sense.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.880]   We're still sending text messages to our friends.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.600]   We're still looking at our social media feeds instead of picking up
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.440]   the local newspaper, we're reading an online newspaper
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.920]   or an online social media feed that we still do back home.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.480]   In a sense, smartphones have made travel easier.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.160]   They've made it harder to get lost and harder to get bored.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.920]   But they've also sort of trapped us into those same insipid habits
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.320]   that we have back home.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.160]   And I've literally met travelers who even on the other side of the world,
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.320]   the last thing they do before they fall asleep is look at their phone.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.920]   The first thing they look at when they wake up is look at their phone.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.480]   It's like, guys, you've paid all this money to go the other side of the world.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.520]   Do you really need to put a phone between yourself and what you're experiencing?
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.000]   So that's why I'm a big fan of encouraging people to use their five senses,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.200]   to not just look and listen, but to smell and taste
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.080]   and feel their way around the world.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.520]   And really, you don't have to travel without a phone at all,
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.200]   but maybe leave it in the room for a day.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.440]   My wife and I did this in Paris and Norway this summer.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.800]   We found all the cool places we wanted to see
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.720]   on our computers and phone when we were still in our lodging.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.760]   But we would mark it on a paper map and use that paper map to explore the city.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.840]   And that allowed us to not fall back on our phone
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.880]   every time we thought we were lost, not to fall back on our phone
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.160]   every time we wanted to send that cool picture of the cool dog to our mom back home.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.040]   Right. Basically, it just forced us to be unconnected for a while.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.520]   We could have those experiences.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.200]   And sometimes there's this little pencil for a restaurant
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.280]   that we wanted to see in the 20th arrondissement.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.080]   But suddenly we found a place in the 11th arrondissement that was sort of cooler
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.480]   and completely caught us by surprise.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.040]   And this cool fromagerie was next door and we got some cheese for the next day.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.240]   Right. So I think allowing yourself to have experiences by chance,
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.280]   to use the information that is available through our phone,
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.880]   but not to drown ourself in all these options
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.680]   so that we're always questioning the moment we're in.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   Going back to the idea of living so much of our lives in the future,
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.240]   even as we plan and try to be responsible individuals,
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.040]   we cheat ourselves so much out of what is in the present.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.880]   And there's that old it's actually an old phrase now, FOMO, fear of missing out.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.320]   Sometimes we have our phone.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.240]   We can be having this amazing experience in an amazing city.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.440]   But our phone is telling us that, oh, maybe there's a better market
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.960]   like that's five minutes this way, or maybe there's a better restaurants
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.200]   that ten minutes this way.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.480]   Actually, no, it's amazing.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.960]   You found this place by accident.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.760]   Embrace that while you have it.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.920]   Give yourself permission to trust your instincts, to trust your nose
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.240]   and your palate as much as that smartphone app,
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.160]   because those are the things that you're going to remember,
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.240]   that you're really allowing yourself to travel as a pilgrim instead of as a consumer
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.480]   and to sort of wander yourself into a deeper understanding
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.280]   of what that travel experience can be.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:17.920]   I like that.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.320]   I try even locally, my wife and I, like, let's go on a walk tonight
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.680]   and let's just leave our phones at home.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.280]   If we have the kids, if we don't have the kids and they're at home,
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.760]   we don't leave the house because they're so small.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.400]   But, you know, if our au pair's there, we're like, OK, we got to bring a phone.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.080]   But maybe we're just going to like turn the ringer on and put it in a bag
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.960]   or something. We just try.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.560]   It's hard, but I think it can be really valuable.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.520]   Well, there's just a corollary.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:42.280]   Travel has become so much like home that these lessons apply in both places.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.160]   Right. That being connected constantly is not always the best way to raise a child,
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.480]   just like it's not always the best way to experience another city.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.560]   So it's funny how these travel lessons become more and more relevant to home
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.640]   as home becomes more and more a part of the way we travel in other places.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.240]   So a couple of things I want to hit before we wrap.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.400]   I found that one of the greatest ways that I lighten the cost of my travels
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.720]   is to play the travel hacking points and miles game.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.480]   I know you're not as deep in that world as me, but I'm curious
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.080]   if there are any kind of cost saving travel hacks that you like
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.240]   that we can share with people listening.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.520]   My old one was just fly into a place and then take it from there.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.400]   Regardless of the multi itinerary you could do,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.640]   there might be a train that crosses an international border.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.640]   There might be buses.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.280]   There might be share taxis that could inspire the next Lyft
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.840]   or Uber in some part of the world that you didn't even know existed.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.760]   But suddenly it's a really cool way to travel.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.920]   And the people are just delighted that this awkward, sweaty American
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.160]   is in this share taxi in Laos or Senegal or some other part of the world.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.920]   So I'm a big fan of overland travel and flying into a place
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.840]   and winging it from there.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.400]   Oftentimes, too, you go into the neighborhood in Bangkok
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.880]   or the neighborhood in Nairobi where local people find their plane tickets.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.080]   And oftentimes those onward flights are cheaper than if they had been done
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.160]   internationally through a middleman.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.680]   What I've done as I've gotten older, I'm not the best flight
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.800]   travel hacker in the world.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.280]   I can probably learn from you and other people who have done that quite well
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.160]   with credit cards and miles and things like that.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.320]   In part, I got so insinuated in the overland travel sort of bucket shop
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.560]   travel bucket shops or places where in immigrant communities
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.880]   or in local communities where you buy discounted tickets.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.200]   But I've often found that more recently I've taken a lot of trips
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.920]   through flight aggregators like Airtreks, Airtreks.com
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.080]   that allows you to plan multi-stop itineraries under one umbrella
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.040]   that you can fly around.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.000]   I think they do itineraries up to 25 stops,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.680]   but I usually do like four to eight stops.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.640]   I've done it around the world.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   But this summer, for example, I went from Denver to London,
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.880]   to Paris, to Norway, to Faroe Islands, back to London and Denver.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.600]   Just under one umbrella, I was able to sort of have them put together
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.160]   the best flights possible.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.920]   There's two ways you can do it with Airtreks.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.760]   One fun thing is you can waste half a day
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   just doing a sample trip that you don't actually plan on taking,
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.320]   but just seeing how much it would it cost for me to fly from New York
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:56.200]   to Brazil, to West Africa, to Italy, and take a train to Moscow
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.840]   and then take another train to the Pacific and then fly to Bangkok.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.200]   You can waste a day just doing trips that are absurd just to see if it works.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.520]   They also have a number that you can call and talk to a person.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.000]   I usually use them in tandem.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.560]   And the person will help you put together this trip.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.240]   And they might give you some advice like saying, well, actually,
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.440]   the cheapest way to fly from Los Angeles to Australia is through Singapore.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.600]   And maybe you can just stay for a week in Singapore on this cheap trip
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.720]   and get another experience out of that trip.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.640]   So what I do with Airtreks is usually I'll tinker around with their online widget.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.840]   And then when I think I know where to go, I'll call the representative.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.640]   It's sort of like a travel coach.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.400]   And they help you design that flight.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.240]   And so I'm not saying it's always the best way to hack flights.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.920]   But my gosh, if you have an extended multi-stopper around the world flight,
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.960]   it's a great way to go because it saves money.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.280]   Everything is under one bucket.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.480]   And you basically have an advisor that can give you that great advice,
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.040]   saying that like, yeah, you'll save two hundred dollars going through Bangkok.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.560]   And actually, Bangkok's pretty cool.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.760]   Why don't you stay there two weeks and save another hundred dollars?
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.160]   It's not technically a hack, but it's a great service.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.400]   Airtreks.com.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.440]   Other question I always like to ask everyone.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.880]   Is there a city in the world you know well enough to leave anyone listening
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.800]   who might be heading there with a few kind of unusual or fun recommendations
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.360]   for whether it's a meal, a drink or some unusual activity or experience?
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.240]   Wow, let me think.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.560]   Immediately it came to my Paris.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.280]   It's like I'm not even that much of an expert on Paris.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.320]   I've been there many, many, many summers in a row to teach English.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.600]   And so my French isn't even that good.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.200]   I'm there teaching classes in English.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   This is sort of cheating on the answer, but it's a good answer.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.160]   It's an old French technique of the flaneur.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.400]   Do you know what a flaneur is?
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.240]   No. A flaneur is this is Baudelaire sort of invented the idea in the 19th century.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.520]   It's a person who walks through the city, not in search of things,
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.840]   but just in search of experiences.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.000]   They don't see the city as this utilitarian route between point A and point B.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.160]   It's a person that realizes that wandering from point A to point B
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.800]   is full of experiences that you don't know about yet.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.600]   And so you can use it as it's technically a male verb,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.000]   but you can be a flaneuse or you can be a female flaneur.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.880]   It's a noun, but it can also be a verb.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.960]   I'm going to flaneur my way through this experience.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.840]   It's very baked into the Parisian way of seeing the world.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.240]   You can practice it in any city in the world.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.440]   And you probably don't want to go through a dangerous neighborhood drunk at night.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.160]   But being a flaneur who just sort of wanders through a city,
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.320]   not quite knowing where you're going to go,
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.560]   but knowing that something awesome is going to happen based on something
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.760]   you smell, something you see or somebody you bump into.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   That is a great strategy for seeing a place.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.360]   And I'll have an aside story.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.080]   I talk about it in the Vagabond's Way.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.760]   I use TripAdvisor to find TripAdvisor's best rated rendang restaurant
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.000]   in the Indonesian city of Bukit Tinggi.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.600]   I went there and it was fine.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.560]   But what I realized I'd gone through a market again, going back to markets
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.520]   through of people who lived in Bukit Tinggi eating dinner
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.240]   and they weren't going to this place.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.440]   They didn't use TripAdvisor that lived in Bukit Tinggi.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.480]   They're eating in the market.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.520]   And so I realized that instead of just flaneuring my way through the market
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.680]   and seeing what was delicious,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.400]   I'd use TripAdvisor to a place that was outside of the market.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.960]   So that has only reinforced the idea that wandering through a place,
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.440]   just sort of being hyper aware, not to your phone,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.280]   but to the environment in the manner of a flaneur who's just seeking experience
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.160]   and is seeking surprise.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.360]   That's probably better than any single recommendation
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.800]   I could give you in Paris.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   My wife is the foodie.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.680]   She could give you restaurant recommendations, but she's out of town today.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.440]   So be a flaneur. Yeah. Fair answer. I'll take it.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.400]   The book's out. You can get it where books are sold.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.640]   I picked up a copy at a local bookstore.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.920]   So thank you for writing it. It was fantastic.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.120]   Where could people stay on top of everything you're doing,
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.840]   all your writing and everything you're up to?
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.080]   I'm an old school website guy.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.480]   I've had it for almost 25 years.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.120]   RolfPotts.com. It connects to all my socials, which I use from time to time.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.040]   But really, it's a good starting point for all the books I've written,
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.720]   for all my podcasts, my Deviate with Rolf Potts podcast,
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.640]   with articles I've written back into my dirtbag days in the 1990s.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.560]   For all things Rolf Potts, it's a good place to start. Awesome.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.760]   Well, Rolf, thank you so much for being here.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.040]   Yeah, it's good talking to you, Christian.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:44.960]   It's fun to hear your stories.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.440]   Good luck with your next adventure with your kids.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.200]   Ah, thank you.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.800]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.560]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.400]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.840]   in Apple Podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi,
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.960]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com or @Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.200]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
