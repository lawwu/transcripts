[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   If you're early on in your accumulation phase,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.880]   keep up the pace.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.440]   There's always a good time to invest in equities.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.360]   If equities are at an all-time high,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   I would say to myself, "Hey, there's momentum.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.160]   I just jump on the bandwagon, invest more in equities."
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.620]   There's some people who do it the opposite, right?
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.560]   They say, "Well, if equities are expensive
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.640]   and they're at all-time highs,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.840]   well, I don't want to invest, right?
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   Equities are going to crash soon."
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   And then equities do crash.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.300]   And then they say, "No, I don't want to invest
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.600]   because it's way too scary."
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.240]   So you have to almost rewire your mind.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.920]   If equities are at an all-time high, great.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.740]   Momentum is working.
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.540]   I'm going to keep investing
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.680]   and this thing will keep rolling forever.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.900]   And then if equities are down,
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.120]   okay, forget about momentum.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.440]   And now we think valuation.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.600]   So now we say equities are cheap.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.480]   So now is a great time to invest too.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.400]   Don't really sweat the volatility.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.760]   Don't really sweat valuation so much.
