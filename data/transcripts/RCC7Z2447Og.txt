[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   A Christian man, a husband and a father who lives in Sweden writes in with today's question.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880]   "Hello Pastor John, I love this podcast and your teachings.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   I live in Sweden, a coercive country.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.200]   Socialists in a lot of ways, homeschooling exemptions for religious convictions were
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.980]   outlawed here not long ago.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.760]   We must send our children to school or the government threatens to take them away from
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.760]   us.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.240]   The United States forces children to begin preschool when they're just six years old.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.040]   Christian schools are practically illegal and a school may have a Christian profile,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.940]   but it's a meaningless title.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.680]   These few Christian schools are still not allowed to be religious or teach a Christian
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680]   worldview.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.600]   They're still forced by law to abide to the same teaching plan as secular atheistic schools
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   to give children a secular education and must even teach our children LGBTQ as a positive
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440]   norm.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   In such a country, Pastor John, how should we parent?"
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.600]   Let me try to build up a case or an understanding from the more basic and broad principle to
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   the immediate application to a parent in Sweden faced with this kind of difficult challenge.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.720]   I would start at the bottom by affirming that God has assigned to parents, parents, not
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.600]   the state, parents, the rearing and shaping of the minds and hearts of the children in
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   the knowledge of God and in how to live that out in the world.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.920]   I would base that on text like Ephesians 6.4, "Fathers, bring up your children in the discipline
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.760]   and the instruction of the Lord," and Deuteronomy 6, 6, and 7, and the book of Proverbs that
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   focuses on the teaching of fathers and mothers as foundational for life.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   And of course, parents have always known that they need help from others in many ways, church,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.640]   community, for example, with expertise that they don't have to build into their children.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   And that's not an implication of just modern living, the technical age.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.640]   Paul's parents in the first century, Paul's parents saw fit to supplement what he got
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   at home from Lois and Eunice—his dad was not a believer—with the education "at
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.080]   the feet of Gamaliel" in Acts 22.3.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.880]   So that's not a new principle.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.240]   So parents and those that parents partner with to build into their children what they
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.200]   need for life, that's the first principle.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.520]   That's a given, I think, for Christians.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.680]   The second principle I would lay down is that God has ordained for there to be a thing like
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   government and state, and that government wields the sword, Romans 13.4, meaning that
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.360]   the government can enforce laws with coercion, fines, imprisonment, bodily harm, death.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.280]   And this government is to have the good of its people at heart, 1 Peter 2.14, which implies
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   that it will have a compelling interest in whether its people are educated, at least
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.320]   educated enough to make society function.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   Just imagine what would happen if in modern societies no one could read, no one could
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.160]   do basic arithmetic, not to mention be able to think critically in regard to the vast
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   complexities of what make the infrastructure of cities function.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.800]   My goodness, I was thinking last winter in Minneapolis, we had this spate of weather
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.720]   that was like 10, 20 below zero for days on end.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.920]   I thought if the infrastructure of this city broke, we'd freeze to death.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   We really would.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.560]   So it really matters to the government who cares about the welfare of its working that
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   there be basic education and more than basic.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.820]   The third principle, though, and really important in this situation, would be that this compelling
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.400]   interest of governments to have an educated population becomes evil.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.800]   It becomes evil when it preempts the more foundational right of the family to educate
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   its children.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:30.440]   In other words, governments, I would argue, should find a way to encourage an educated
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.660]   populace by respecting the rights of families and promoting multiple avenues of all kinds
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.640]   of lower and higher education as parents seek out ways to partner with those who have expertise
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   in equipping their children to function wisely and morally and productively in the world,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   which now with those three basic principles that I would lay down brings us to the situation
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.680]   in Sweden and parenting there.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.040]   And of course, Sweden is not the only country in the world which, according to these principles,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.400]   overreaches in their intrusion upon the rights of families.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   I know at least two families right here in Minneapolis who came from another country
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   in Europe precisely because they forbade homeschooling and required state education with all of its
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.080]   indoctrination of the modern worldview.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.880]   Millions of Christians, millions of Christians around the world have lived and do live in
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:51.840]   oppressive regimes that have such overweening power that they can overreach their God-given
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.880]   role and enforce that overreach with the power of imprisonment and death.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.160]   So this is not unusual.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.000]   This is common throughout the world and has always been common.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   So I see three possibilities today for Christian families, say, in a situation like this family
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.620]   finds itself in Sweden.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.680]   One is emigration out of their country to a more free society, an option that probably
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.200]   simply does not exist for most families for many reasons, including increasingly restrictive
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   immigration laws and lots of other things that would make that not only difficult but
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.120]   unwise probably.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.400]   Second, keep your children out of schools and run the risk of losing them.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.160]   We've read, I mean, in recent years we saw in the news families in Sweden where that
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   happened.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.240]   They took away five kids from the parents because they wouldn't send them to public
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   schools.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.800]   Now, that's a massive risk and probably most parents are simply not going to say, "No,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   that would be worth it."
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.480]   No, it probably wouldn't be worth it.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.320]   Keep your kids and risk the education, which now brings me to my third option, which is
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.800]   the one most families probably will follow and will more or less, I think, rightly have
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:29.160]   to follow, namely that a radically Christian education at home alongside the state education,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   which is going to be diametrically opposed in many ways, will be needed in order to build
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.960]   into the children's lives two deep and unshakable convictions.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.520]   This is the goal now.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.920]   One, that Jesus, the kind of person he is, the kind of amazing salvation he offers, is
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:58.480]   better than anything they will meet in school or anywhere else among their peers.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   That's the first conviction.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.320]   They want to build into these kids with this radical Christian education at home and in
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.160]   the church and among friends.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.760]   Second, that the way of Jesus, the lifestyle of Jesus that he teaches and models, calls
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:22.040]   for, is better, better, better, better than any lifestyle offered at school or in the
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.040]   media.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.080]   This is not different.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.160]   This is not a different kind of parenting in any culture, but I would think that in
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:40.320]   a situation where children are forced to be indoctrinated with unbiblical views of what
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.440]   is true and false and right and wrong and beautiful and ugly, the intentionality of
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   the parents' Christian education at home would be greater and more urgent to build
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   the mindset into our children from the earliest age that we really are not part of this system.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.600]   It feels like it would—I think that's true here in America, but parents don't
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   feel it.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   They don't feel it.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.920]   They increasingly know it's true, but we felt like we belong here for so long, we
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.720]   don't feel like we're really not part of the system.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.480]   It is our system, sort of, and that's increasingly not the case.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.200]   Well, in Sweden, they've declared it's not the case.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:32.080]   So I think there's this greater intentionality where we actually teach our children we live
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.560]   in a coercive, unbiblical, unjust system.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560]   We teach them that.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.320]   I mean, that would be considered unpatriotic in some countries, and Americans consider
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.060]   it unpatriotic in large measure today, and increasingly they shouldn't.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.360]   So in Sweden, I would think you've got to teach your kids from the get-go that we live
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.880]   in a system where they are compelling us to do what they ought not to be compelling us
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   to do.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.940]   The kids have that mindset from the beginning.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.760]   And what I would stress for this Christian father is that the great challenge is to make
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:19.480]   that sense of alienation from the state and from the culture, make it clear without becoming
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:30.760]   bitter or acrimonious or sullen or fearful, but instead modeling for the children abounding
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:42.560]   joy in Christ, great confidence in his sovereignty over evil, coercive regimes, tremendous hope
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:52.280]   that even under these constraints, Christ is able to show himself and his way as far
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:01.520]   more deeply satisfying and finally rewarding than anything this present world offers.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.020]   That's the great challenge.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.200]   The biblical commands to rejoice always and to give thanks in everything, indeed for everything
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.560]   in Ephesians 5, were spoken.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.880]   Those commands to rejoice and give thanks were spoken in situations profoundly oppressive
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.620]   and embattled.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:33.200]   So the great challenge in parenting is to be a certain kind of person who is so confident
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:41.480]   in the power and wisdom and goodness of King Jesus, President Jesus, Premier Jesus, Prime
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.960]   Minister Jesus, that our joy is indomitable.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:57.120]   The children must be shown that the way of Jesus is most joyful, even if it is a painful
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.880]   way, a self-denying way, a narrow way that leads to life.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.040]   And I would just add one more thing, and I'm sure this father knows this probably better
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.080]   than I do.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.320]   Families shouldn't be fighting this battle with their kids, that is, not against their
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.780]   kids, but alongside their kids to show them the truth.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.160]   They shouldn't be fighting this battle alone.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.840]   If possible, they should be gathering in healthy churches, surrounded by other families with
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.080]   similar hopes and longings.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:37.880]   Young people love to have friends, and the power of peer pressure is enormous.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:44.960]   The Bible says that bad company corrupts good morals, so we need to pray earnestly that
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.000]   God would raise up for our children other Christian friends.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.840]   And we must band together as Christian parents to help each other provide the kind of alternatives
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.960]   for our children and young people that they can enjoy, so that when they're offered
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.720]   alternatives that would not be healthy from their non-Christian peers, they are able to
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.800]   stand.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.720]   There is no safe place in the world to raise children, not in America for sure, not in
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   Sweden, not in China, not in North Korea.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.960]   There's no safe place to raise Christian children, children who will treasure Christ
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840]   above everything.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.120]   Only God can work the miracle in the hearts of our children that we long for.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.680]   So with all of our teaching and all of our modeling and all of our friendships and church
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:50.720]   and all of our rejoicing, we must pray without ceasing for the miracle of regeneration in
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   our children.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.160]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:59.240]   There is no safe place in the world to raise children, and location change is not a simple
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.080]   fix, especially with the influence of digital media all around our kids, no matter where
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   they are today.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.280]   I feel that desperation as a homeschooling dad in the States even.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.720]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.960]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.440]   Do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.760]   Well, God's love is being undermined all over the world right now, and I'm not talking
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.320]   about an undermining of his love by the world or by secular culture.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.480]   The love of God is being undermined by professing Christians, pastors, and churches that claim
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.160]   to be advocating for nothing more than the love of God.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.600]   It's a fascinating and important phenomenon to see up close, and we will next time on
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   Wednesday.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Wednesday when we look at
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.560]   how churches sabotage God's love.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.260]   Bye.
